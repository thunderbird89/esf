# Land units
On land, the Federation relies heavily on robotics to maintain its edge, utilizing both humanoid and non-humanoid platforms, as well as autonomous and piloted variants. Most piloted units are still equipped with autonomous AIs, so that the unit can continue operating in the event of a pilot incapacitation, or allow the pilot to leave the unit and operate in areas where the unit cannot enter or to operate as a two-man team with the unit.

## Landmate
The mainstay of the Federation's mechanized infantry is the *Landmate* powered exoskeleton.

The pilot is housed in the chest cavity of the unit, which is substantially larger than a human (standing app. 3 meters tall), and is operated via motion capture of the pilot's limbs and force feedback to the user, though its onboard AI can also operate the unit autonomously and follow simple commands ("Move!", "Attack [there]!", "Defend!", "Return [to formation]!") - this is automatically used if the pilot leaves the unit to operate, perhaps in confined spaces - or it can be controlled remotely by a more advanced AI core.

The Landmate features a similar modular frame as the Talon, allowing it to customize its loadout based on mission requirements. The Landmate has two shoulder-mounted attachment points for missile pods or gimbaled autocannons, and is usually armed with scaled-up versions of infantry rifles powered by the armor's powerplant.

Defensively, the Landmate is equipped with shields, as well as a modular armor system that can eject damaged plates and "shift" surrounding plates to cover the area. This is aided by its human-like agility despite its stature, as well as burstable "jump jets" that allow it to leap and hover for short periods (up to 15 seconds at a time).

## Guardian
The _Guardian_ is the Federation's point-defense platform, tasked with shooting down missiles, drones, and even artillery and other projectiles. Guardian nodes are capable of operating on their own, but really shine when networked to a coordinator node.

Each Guardian battery is equipped with a long-range and a separate high-resolution radar. The long-range radar provides early detection and tracking, while the short-range high-resolution array provides precise tracking for terminal guidance, capable of accurately tracking even hypersonic warheads and projecting filght paths.
The batteries can be one of several types, depending on the nature of the anticipated threats:
- Railgun batteries fire 2.5 mm tungsten-carbide fletchettes at a significant fraction of lightspeed. They are the longest range, but have the lowest tracking, and can usually fire five shots before reloading, or 25 shots before the thermal clip is saturated and needs to eject.
- Pulse lasers fire X-ray laser bursts microseconds in width, at extremely high powers. They are unaffected by gravity, but atmospheric conditions can hamper them severely, which is somewhat compensated by their high tracking. They can fire five pulses before saturating the termal clip.
- Beam lasers use continuous beams to burn their target, boasting high tracking but short range. They can continue firing for five seconds before overheating.
- Plasma burst turrets occupy a middle ground in terms of range and tracking, are not affected by gravity, and can fire ten bursts before saturating the thermal clip.

When networked to a controlling node, each Guardian reports incoming targets and the controller distributes them for engagement based on each turret's area saturation, firing arcs, ammo/power status, cooldown, etc.
