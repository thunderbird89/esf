## Naming conventions
The Federation employs a unified designation system for its assets. Designations consist of one or more letters designating the type, purpose, and operation, followed by a dash, a number signifying iteration count, then a code name for the design.

### Unified Designation Framework
The Federation employs a standardized system to designate and categorize its diverse arsenal of platforms and equipment. This system enables quick identification, classification, and deployment of assets across various mission profiles.

## Foundational technologies
The Federation, thanks to its extraterrestrial benefactors, has access to several technologies and materials beyond the reach of current terrestrial nation. These include high-performance engines and power plants, energy weapons and shields, advanced AI systems, and many others. 

### Neural interfacing
Federation platforms rarely use neural interfacing, as the technology is deemed to be too noisy under field conditions for reliable control. As such, Talons, Landmates, and other vehicles don't require "synchronization" or similar practices.

That said, neural *implants* are in use, especially by covert ops specialists where it's used for communications and controlling other cybernetics. 

### Nanotechnology
Notably, however, the benefactors have **not** granted access to self-replicating nanotechnology, citing the dangerous nature of such nanites. Nanotechnology is available to the Federation in limited modalities, usually restricted to _Utility Fog_-type deployments or small-scale pre-programmed self-assembling structures (such as wound dressings).

### Plasma turbines
Plasma turbines are a core propulsion method employed by the Federation, using micro fusion power plants to generate thrust outstripping conventional jet engines by several orders of magnitude and are capable of operating both inside and outside the atmosphere. They are used across almost all aerial platforms in the Foundation for their thrust and top speed, which is unparalleled on Earth, and on par with alien adversaries.

### Shields
The Federation employs shield generators that create constrained energy fields capable of being shaped according to the subject needs. They diffract/disrupt energy weapons like laser and plasma bolts, and deflect physical projectiles, even various hypervelocity rounds employed by extraterrestrial forces.

### Offensive weapons
The Federation relies mainly on magnetic accelerators for offensive purposes, but also makes use of various laser-, microwave-, and plasma-based weapons, including using micro plasma generators accelerated from a weapon that ionize and gather atmospheric gases as they travel, becoming more destructive as they travel downrange.

### Artificial Intelligence
The Federation utilizes AI broadly. 

They equip most vehicles and robotic units with shackled AIs to make them able to operate autonomously, but only within predefined mission parameters. These AIs utilize various motivator modules in the programming to direct their actions towards preset goals, in various ways.

Administratively, various unshackled AI systems support the Federation's operations in the various theatres and battlespaces, not just militarily, but also bureacratically.

There are also a number of specialized AIs with distinct personalities, geared towards various tasks. These named AIs include the following:
- `HARBINGER`: specialized for massive parallel control of various combat units, capable of operating up to 2,500 simultaneous units in the field.
- `CIPHER`: specialized for cryptographics and codebreaking operations, as well as hacking and electronic intrusion.
- `SUNTZU`: optimized for large-scale strategic planning and execution control.
- `ARCHIMEDES`: specializing in scientific research and creation of new technologies, as well as physical data analysis.

The names of these named AIs are always written in all-uppercase to distinguish them from the lesser AIs who do not enjoy the degree of freedom and ability afforded to these by their exceptional hardware.

### Modularity
Most Federation platforms are *modular*, with an engineering core consolidating power generation and computing systems with life support (if necessary), surrounded by one or more *module racks* that accept modules via standardized high-/mid-/low-power connectors to extend functionality. These modules can be changed quickly even in forward operating bases with little engineering equipment, allowing units to change loadout and capabilities in response to shifting mission profiles.

### FTL
The Federation has access to limited FTL capacities, provided by the benefactors. These are only suitable for in-system travel and cannot achieve interstellar travel. If interstellar travel is required, the benefactors will send long-range ships to act as transports for Federation personnel and materiel.

Overall, the galaxy has three main methods of FTL travel available to them:
1. _Warp drives_ for intra-system travel
2. A galaxy-spanning network of _stargates_ for system-to-system travel along prescribed connections
3. _Jump drives_ for instant travel to any location marked by an active beacon

#### Warp drives
The primary mode of FTL travel available (both for the Federation and for aliens) is the _warp drive_. This is based on the concept of the _Alcubierre drive_, as the benefactors have solved the mathematical/physical challenge of reconciling warped space with the theory of relativity, without the use of negative matter.
Short-range warp drives installed on larger space-faring vessels (usually transports or freighters) are capable of up to 8 AU/s, while the _Talon_ multi-mode fighter boasts an impressive warp drive capable of 20 AU/s displacement.

Warp drives operate by locking onto remote gravimetric signatures, then forming a tunnel of warped space through which the ship can travel. While the method is fast and simple to start (provided sufficient power is available, all that is required is for the ship's velocity vector to be within 5ยบ of its target *and* for the ship to be travelling at least 25 m/s), it suffers from the fact that once the tunnel forms, the ship has no control over it, and is restricted to moving in straight lines towards its target. However, since the ship travels in a tunnel of warped space, it can "pass through" solid objects while en route (since they don't actually occupy the same 3-space), and is only affected by gravitational disturbances.

#### Jump drives
Jump drives are installed on larger ships (titans, dreadnoughts, carriers, supercarriers) as well as dedicated jump freighters, and provide "personal" point-to-point interstellar travel. A jump drive-equipped ship may lock on to a suitable beacon - which the Federation refers to as a _cynosural field/beacon_ - whose field signature is transmitted to it in normal communication channels, and can then open a wormhole to the location, emerging within 10 kms of the field's center. This allows these ships to traverse large distances immediately, without the use of the gate network's routing, but the field can be disrupted, rendering a jump impossible - this is routinely done in high-security systems as a precaution.
Alternatively, the ship might keep the wormhole open from one side, creating a "jump bridge" other, smaller vessels can use. This is still subject to the ship maintaining the bridge having a stable lock on the cynosural field signature.

#### Stargates
Stargates are the primary method of traversing interstellar distances, using megastructures constructed at the edge of a system's gravity well. Gates connect to one and only one system, providing bidirectional transit between the two points and forming a point-to-point network throughout the galaxy.

Stargates are "public access" in the sense that any ship may use the network to travel from one system to the next. However, ships or captains with sufficiently low security ratings may be restricted from entering higher-security systems, though gate transit is still possible but the ship may be attacked by local law enforcement on the other side.

The Sol system has no stargate, but the Xenari have left a remotely operated cynosural beacon around Jupiter for transit into the system when necessary.

### Infantry
Federation infantry makes heavy use of powered exoskeletons even before making the step to mechanized infantry, from lightweight frames with minimal motion assist to heavy bulky units with armor and shield generators. The exoskeletons allow them increased survivability on the battlefield and enables infantrymen to wield heavy weapons.

### Infantry weapons
Regular infantry is usually assigned magnetic accelerator rifles using 2 mm tungsten darts, but depending on the mission profile, might be assigned low-power (25-50 MW) plasma rifles. For sidearms, smaller, 10-15 MW plasma pistols are used.

Magnetic rifles can launch a variety of rounds, from simple kinetic penetrators through explosive rounds to specialty rounds with various exotic effects.

#### RSM-5 Sniper rifle
Although the speed of the round means even the regular magnetic rifle is longer-range than almost all conventional rifles (much less assault and battle rifles), the Federation also employs a designated sniper rifle, the `RSK-5/M`.

This rifle is a compact railgun design comparable to most designated marksmans rifles, utilizing magnetic repulsors along the upper receiver and the barrel, so that when the trigger is squeezed to the first stage, the targeting scope locks the target under the reticle, and levitates the barrel to decouple it physically from the receiver, preventing small movements from throwing off aim. As long as the trigger is held, the rifle automatically tracks the target within a 5ยบ cone, but only on squeezing the trigger further is the round actually fired.

Range is stated to be in excess of 5,000 meters, with lethal range all the way out to 15,000 meters (at the expense of some accuracy). The rifle is stated to be able to fire five rounds in quick succession before saturating its thermal clip.

The builtin scope can switch between visible-light, night vision, and thermal imaging modes, with up to 5x optical zoom. It automatically establishes range to target using a laser rangefinder, and calculates ballistics accordingly, tracking a variety of factors (range, crosswind, Coriolis force, potential ricochets, target movement, etc.), providing an overlaid aimpoint for the shooter once a target is acquired.

#### Thermal clips
Nearly all Federation firearms use _thermal clips_, machined blocks of a proprietary lithium-beryllium alloy of large heat capacity, to store waste heat of their operation. Most weapons can cool down naturally over a few minutes if the rate of fire is kept low enough, but can also be ejected from the gun and replaced with a fresh clip to keep firing immediately.
