# The galaxy
## Aliens
Much of the galaxy is in the sphere of influence of one of the four great races:
- The (mostly) benevolent _Xenari_ who delight in guiding younger races
- The belligerent _Ryzak_ who thrive on conquest to feed their empire
- The enigmatic _Seraphyn_ who mostly prefer their philosophical debates to active engagement
- The industrious _Kryllians_ whose mass-production facilities and merchant vessels keep the galaxy's economy running

Earth and the Sol system happens to lie in a "border zone" of sorts between the Xenari and Ryzak spheres of influence, and is of interest to both parties for reasons not currently known to the Federation.

### Alien technology
The Federation, despite working closely with their Xenari benefactors, has a comparatively shallow understanding of most alien technology.

They do understand that the warp drives provided to the Federation are insufficient to cross interstellar distances, which can only be traversed by using _stargates_ constructed at the edge of a system's gravity well or by _jump drives_ that can create momentary wormholes to bridge distant location, provided a suitable beacon - which Federation engineers refer to as a _cynosural field/beacon_ - exists at the destination.
The Sol system has no stargate, but the Xenari have left a remotely operated cynosural beacon around Jupiter for transit into the system when necessary.

Stargates are "public access" in the sense that any ship may use the network to travel from one system to the next. Gates connect to one and only one system, providing bidirectional transit between the two points and forming a point-to-point network throughout the galaxy.
Ships or captains with sufficiently low security ratings may be restricted from entering higher-security systems, though gate transit is still possible but the ship may be attacked by local law enforcement on the other side.

Jump drives are installed on larger ships (titans, dreadnoughts, carriers, supercarriers) as well as dedicated jump freighters, and provide "personal" point-to-point interstellar travel. A jump drive-equipped ship may lock on to a cynosural field signature transmitted to it in normal communication channels, and can then open a wormhole to the location, emerging within 10 kms of the field's center. This allows these ships to traverse large distances immediately, without the use of the gate network's routing, but the field can be disrupted, rendering a jump impossible - this is routinely done in high-security systems as a precaution.
Alternatively, the ship might keep the wormhole open from one side, creating a "jump bridge" other, smaller vessels can use. This is still subject to the ship maintaining the bridge having a stable lock on the cynosural field signature.

## Galactic politics
The galaxy's peace and security is maintained by the _Consolidated Cooperations and Relations Command_, aka CONCORD, composed of delegates from the four great races. CONCORD has sweeping powers to act in the interest of stability, including military sanctions on any of the great races (and by extension, the younger racecs too). As such, no parties question its authority.

CONCORD has recently passed a measure, declaring Earth/the Sol system as a "protected conflict zone". This limits both Xenari and Ryzak activity in the system to covert actions that may not target humanity directly, though limited transfer of technologies is permitted; furthermore, all other star empires are prohibited from interfering in the system, whether against humanity or against the Xenari/Ryzak forces.
