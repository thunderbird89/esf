## Operational security
The exact engineering details and capabilities of covert operations assets are a closely guarded secret for the Federation, with not even allies having access to the specifications of these units. Any other entities only rely on observations and do not have confirmed knowledge of the capabilities.

## Team structure
Most covert operations teams comprise of x people:
- Mission commander: tactical oversight and broad decision-making capabilities for adjusting to VUCA circumstances
- Coordinator: informations specialist collating data for insights
- Operatives: two or more field agents with combat capabilities
- Mission specialists: any specialist operatives with required unique skills

### Enhancements
Covert operatives are usually enhanced with embedded cybernetics. These allow subvocal communication, night vision and zoom optics, HUDs and targeting reticles, and other assistance features via direct neural integration.

Combat specialists are often enhanced with reinforced skeletons and augmented musculature for better CQC performance, or even subdermal ballistic weave for better survivability.

## Covert instruments
Covops teams are assigned weapons and equipment that are generally modeled after civilian items to blend in, and utilize the item's naturally-occurring openings and lines as disguised interfaces.

### Covert armors
Covert power armors are often modeled after clothing, and almost always incorporate shield generators in place of ballistic panels.

Lighter clothing - such as summer clothes and vests - can only sustain shields that withstand small arms fire, but heavier clothing - such as a bulky winter coat - can incorporate motion assist, as well as shields that can withstands most small arms fire, and even two or three hits from something as large as a .50 BMG before needing to recharge.

Personal cloaking devices are too unstable for field use, so agents have no ways of turning invisible.

### Covert tools
#### ICE-Pick
One of the most useful tools for the covert operatives is the _ICE Pick_ - ICE standing for "Intrusion Countermeasure, Electronic", encompassing various electronic and programmatic intrusion countermeasures, and the "pick" referencing a lockpick defeating a lock - which is a small, sharp device, not unlike a screwdriver. The pick can be levered or stabbed into an electronic device, but it can also fire its small probe to subvert devices at a distance.  
Once it finds purchase in a device, the probe sends out conductive carbon nanofibers that snake around signal buses and subvert signaling. Utilizing a high-speed uplink to an electronics warfare AI - usually the tactical support AI on the team's Wraith - the pick the manipulates electronic activity to achieve the desired effect, granting complete control of the device.

#### Face dancer mask
Face dancer masks are gossamer-thin veil-like sheets that employ micro electro-mechanical actuators and micro light-processing units to alter the appearance of operatives. At rest, they are transparent and almost invisible on the operative's face.

By programming the mask with a high-resolution 3D scan and a voice sample of at least 10 seconds, the mask - when worn - can cling to the operative's face and alter its shape and consistency to match the donor subject, using its refractive units to match skin tone, eye color, and even replicate blemishes and textures as necessary. Once the mask is programmed, it only consumes power when changing its appearance - when simply masking, it requires no current to keep its appearance.
This copying ability is sufficiently close to fool facial recognition systems, iris/retinal scanners, and even infrared vein-mapping recognition cameras.

By refracting sound waves internally, it can alter the operative's voice to match the extrapolated voice print of the target. With sufficient samples (at least 30 seconds of speech), the extrapolation is close enough to pass digital voice print recognition systems.

The 3D scans needed to create a face can be acquired by covert stereoscopic structured-light cameras hidden in the oeprative's glasses, enabling a single operative to mimic a number of faces on-the-fly during a mission.

#### Other tools
Other tools include personal video scramblers that employ directed radiation to scramble surveillance cameras; directional speakers that can be utilized to cast sound elsewhere and create distractions; or armoring gloves that can structurally reinforce objects in contact to create improvised cover out of mundane items (one of the few instances of nanite technology utilized by the Federation).

## Q-Cars
Covert-ops vehicles named after the famed Q-ships of WWII, platforms modeled to look like civilian cars or vans but equipped with combat technology. Q-cars operate using sophisticated engines that can provide much greater torque and acceleration than otherwise expected from the vehicle's size and incorporate light shields and armor for survivability.

Offensively, the cars feature concealed plasma weaponry mounted in the headlights, miniaturized forward-firing railguns in the door skirts, and magnetically-accelerated monomolecular blade launchers in the taillights.
Vans are also equipped with foldaway panels to allow operatives to emerge and return fire on pursuers with handheld weapons.

## Wraith
The *Wraith covert operations platform* is a stealth transport and fallback location.

The Wraith's low-emission engines and active/passive stealth systems (containing stealth composites and coatings, as well as active radar cancellation and optical cloaking systems) allow it to penetrate deep into enemy territory and insert the covert team into relative proximity of even urban areas, remaining parked safely back from the AO (usually in wooded areas). 

Its onboard AI and powerful communications suite allows it to tap even encrypted communications and provide intelligence and direction to the team on the ground. The interior is spacious enough to house up to two Q-cars, as well as crew quarters, interrogation rooms and holding brigs for a few captives. In an emergency, the AI is capable of piloting the craft autonomously to support or extract the team, even under fire. It can serve as a mobile base or a fallback location should their safe house be compromised.

Offensively, the Wraith is equipped with a chin-mounted turreted plasma cannon and two banks of internal canted missile launchers mounted dorsally. Additionally, its EWAR suite can be used offensively to disrupt or shut down enemy units, as long as they have *some* sort of electronics, via targeted or broad-area EMPs.
Defensively, the Wraith relies mainly on its stealth capabilities, but its shield generator can withstand extended anti-air fire. However, it is considered weak against interceptors and hostile fixed-wing aircraft, relying on its stealth and EWAR capabilities to evade or neutralize them.

### Core Design Features
