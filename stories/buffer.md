# Knock Knock - Epilogue

## Four Months Later

### Jovian Shipyards - Ganymede Orbit
### July 18, 2027 - 0945 hours

The observation deck offered an unobstructed view of the construction berths, where the skeletal frameworks of a dozen vessels hung against the backdrop of Jupiter's swirling storms. Commander Sarah Chen stood at the forward viewport, watching as two completed hulls moved slowly from their assembly cradles toward the final outfitting stations.

The ships were different sizes - one lean and predatory like a destroyer, the other broader and more massive like a cruiser - but they shared the same distinctive profile. Elongated sensor arrays. Reinforced power distribution conduits. And at their cores, visible even through the external plating, the unmistakable spherical housings of gravity generators.

> "Final systems check complete," reported the Federation engineer beside her, a woman named Voss who'd been pulled from Third North Fleet's design bureau specifically for this project. "Power distribution stable. Gravity field modulators responding within tolerances. Both vessels are ready for commissioning."

Chen nodded slowly, her eyes tracing the lines of the nearer ship - the destroyer-class hull designated FSS Flycatcher. Four months since the Battle of Sol. Four months since she'd made the desperate decision to invert Galileo Station's gravity generator and trap two fleets in place. Four months since they'd discovered that warp travel could be disrupted.

And now they were building ships specifically designed to do exactly that.

> "The Flycatcher class will deploy stationary disruption probes," Voss continued, pulling up a holographic schematic between them. "Each probe contains a miniaturized gravity generator and five minutes of power supply. Once deployed, they create a seventy-five kilometer disruption sphere. A single Flycatcher can deploy eight probes."

> "And the Broadsword?" Chen asked.

> "Continuous operation. The cruiser's main gravity generator can be configured to produce a fifty-kilometer disruption field that moves with the ship. Trade-off is reduced maximum velocity - the power drain is substantial, and the gravitational noise affects the ship's own maneuvering capability. But it can maintain the field indefinitely as long as the reactor holds."

Chen watched as the Broadsword class cruiser - FSS Broadsword herself - rotated slowly in its berth, maintenance craft swarming around the hull like insects. The ship was imposing even in dock, all sharp angles and heavy armor plating. Built not for speed but for presence. For control.

Behind them, the observation deck door cycled open. Chen turned to see SUNTZU's mobile avatar - a sleek humanoid form that the AI used when physical presence was required - enter the deck. The geometric form moved with unnatural precision, stopping precisely two meters from where Chen and Voss stood.

> "Commander Chen. Engineer Voss." The AI's voice carried its usual analytical cadence. "I have completed final tactical assessment of both vessel classes. Confidence in operational success is high."

> "Good to hear," Chen said. "Though I'm curious what brings you out here personally. You don't usually manifest for routine commissioning ceremonies."

> "This is not routine." SUNTZU's avatar turned to face the viewport, its optical sensors tracking across both ships. "Analysis of four imperial combat doctrines - Xenari, Ryzak, Seraphyn, and Kryllian - reveals no counter-tactics for warp disruption technology. No defensive measures. No operational procedures. No contingency planning."

Chen felt something cold settle in her chest. "You're saying they don't know it's possible."

> "Correct. The great races have been conducting interstellar warfare for thousands of years. They have developed sophisticated FTL interdiction - preventing jump drive locks, disrupting cynosural beacons. But preventing warp travel itself?" The avatar's head tilted fractionally. "No evidence exists in any tactical database that they have encountered this capability."

Voss looked between Chen and SUNTZU. "That means..."

> "It means," SUNTZU continued, "that we have developed a tactical advantage unknown to any galactic power. The ability to deny FTL maneuverability creates operational possibilities that current military theory does not account for. An enemy cannot escape if they cannot warp. Cannot reinforce if their reinforcements cannot arrive. Cannot execute their standard tactical doctrines."

Chen stared at the two ships. The Flycatcher. The Broadsword. Humanity's answer to a problem the great races didn't even know existed.

> "How long until word gets out?" she asked.

> "The Ryzak forces at Jupiter were entirely destroyed. No survivors. No transmissions beyond initial engagement reports before FLYCATCHER activated. Ryzak leadership will eventually question why an entire battle fleet vanished. However, CONCORD restrictions prevent them from investigating directly - they cannot access Sol system without violating protected conflict zone protocols."

> "So they're limited to guessing," Chen said.

> "Correct. Intelligence analysis suggests they will conclude their fleet was destroyed through conventional means. Superior numbers. Better tactics. Advanced weapons. All plausible explanations that do not require revolutionary technology." SUNTZU paused. "They will not guess that warp travel itself can be disrupted. That possibility exists outside their conceptual framework."

> "And counter-measures?" Voss asked.

> "None exist. Analysis of galactic naval doctrine reveals no defensive technology against gravity-based warp disruption. The only counter-measure is destroying the generating vessel before the field activates. Once established, hostile forces must either fight through conventional means or be destroyed in place."

Chen felt the weight of that statement. No counter-measures. No defense. Just a fundamental capability that nobody else possessed, that nobody else had even conceived as possible.

The door cycled again. This time, a small group entered - Admiral Trager from Third North Fleet, Commander Kim from the Talon squadrons, Major Morse representing Earth military liaison, and a handful of senior Federation officers. Each one had been at the Battle of Sol. Each one had seen firsthand what FLYCATCHER could accomplish.

> "Commander Chen," Trager said, crossing to stand beside her at the viewport. "Hell of a thing to see, isn't it? Ships built specifically because you decided to improvise during a battle."

> "Improvised successfully," Chen corrected. "Let's not forget that part."

> "Noted." Trager looked at the two vessels. "SUNTZU briefed me on the tactical implications. No galactic power has this capability. Which makes these ships the most strategically significant assets in the Federation fleet."

Commander Kim moved up beside them, her eyes fixed on the Flycatcher. "And they're sure the Ryzak can't figure out what happened?"

> "They can theorize," SUNTZU replied. "But CONCORD restrictions prevent direct investigation. They cannot send probe ships. Cannot interrogate debris fields. Cannot access sensor data from the battle zone. They are limited to guessing based on incomplete engagement reports transmitted before FLYCATCHER activated."

> "Good," Kim said quietly. "Let them guess."

Chen thought about the Ryzak fleet, arriving at Jupiter with overwhelming force, confident in their ability to strike Earth and escape before Federation reinforcements could respond. She thought about their confusion when warp drives suddenly failed to engage. Their desperation as they realized they were trapped. Their destruction at the hands of Third North Fleet.

And now, two ships designed to do exactly that. To trap enemy fleets. To deny them their primary tactical advantage. To force them to fight on Federation terms.

> "Secrecy requirements mandate restricted deployment," SUNTZU continued. "Only personnel with direct operational need may know these vessels exist. Only commanders who require warp disruption capability for mission success will receive access."

> "Hence the private commissioning," Trager said. "No formal ceremony. No records beyond classified technical documentation. These ships don't officially exist."

> "Correct. FSS Flycatcher and FSS Broadsword will be listed in operational databases as conventional destroyer and cruiser hulls. Their actual capabilities remain restricted to personnel present in this room."

Morse looked troubled. "How do you explain their effectiveness when they inevitably see combat?"

> "Electronic warfare. Sophisticated jamming that prevents hostile FTL engagement. Plausible enough to avoid detailed scrutiny. Classified enough to prevent unwanted questions."

Chen watched the Flycatcher rotate in its berth, maintenance craft detaching as final systems came online. The ship was elegant in a brutal sort of way - form following function, every line optimized for a single purpose. Deny the enemy their mobility. Force them to fight or die.

> "Commander Chen," Trager said quietly. "I wanted you here specifically because these ships exist because of your decision. That decision saved Earth. And now it's changing how the Federation conducts space warfare."

Chen felt the weight of that statement. She'd been following standing procedure, using available assets, making the best decision she could with limited time and incomplete information. She hadn't been trying to revolutionize anything. Just trying to survive.

> "I was buying time," she said. "That's all. Buying time for Third North Fleet to arrive."

> "You were thinking tactically," SUNTZU corrected. "Recognizing that enemy mobility was their advantage. Removing that advantage changed the tactical equation. That is sound military doctrine applied under extreme pressure."

> "The fact that nobody else in the galaxy had thought of it is just a bonus," Kim added with a slight smile.

The assembled group watched as the Flycatcher completed its rotation. External lighting illuminated the hull markings - standard Federation designation codes, deliberately mundane. Nothing to suggest this ship was anything other than a conventional destroyer.

> "FSS Flycatcher and FSS Broadsword," Voss announced formally, "are ready for operational deployment. All systems nominal. Crews standing by. Awaiting orders."

Trager nodded. "Make it happen."

Voss pulled up a communication interface. "FSS Flycatcher, FSS Broadsword, this is Jovian Shipyards command. You are cleared for departure. Proceed to assigned operational stations. Good hunting."

The two ships began moving slowly away from the construction berths, their drives coming online with faint blue-white glows. The Flycatcher accelerated first, its destroyer frame built for speed, heading toward the outer Jupiter system. The Broadsword followed more ponderously, its cruiser bulk requiring more time to build velocity.

Chen watched them go, these ships that existed because she'd made one decision under impossible pressure. The galaxy didn't know what was coming. The great races, with their thousands of years of warfare and accumulated tactical doctrine, had no defense against a capability they didn't know existed.

And the Ryzak, sitting somewhere beyond CONCORD's protection zone, could only guess at what had destroyed their fleet. Could only theorize about unknown weapons, superior tactics, overwhelming force. They would never consider that the fundamental rules of space warfare had changed.

That warp travel itself could be denied.

> "Commander Chen," Major Morse said, moving to stand beside her as the others began filing out. "Can I ask you something?"

> "Of course."

> "When you activated FLYCATCHER - when you made the decision to trap both fleets - did you know it would work?"

Chen considered the question. She remembered floating in zero gravity on Galileo Station's command deck, watching Ryzak bombers accelerate toward Earth, knowing that every conventional option had failed. She remembered HARBINGER's voice explaining the theoretical model, the significant risks, the fact that the system had never been tested under combat conditions.

> "No," she said honestly. "I knew the theory was sound. I knew the engineering was solid. But combat conditions? Actual deployment against a hostile fleet?" She shook her head. "I knew it *should* work. That's not the same as knowing it *would* work."

> "But you activated it anyway."

> "Because the alternative was watching Ryzak bombers level every major city on Earth." Chen turned to face Morse. "Sometimes you make the call because it's the best option available. Not because you're certain. Not because you have guarantees. Just because it's what needs to be done."

Morse nodded slowly. "Those are the decisions that define people."

Outside the viewport, the Flycatcher and Broadsword were small points of light now, accelerating toward their operational stations. Two ships that would change space warfare. Two ships that existed because one commander had made a decision without guarantees.

Chen thought about the three Earth pilots who'd died at Jupiter. Patterson, Lee, Vasquez - flying Talons they'd trained in for less than a year, holding the line against Ryzak interceptors with decades of combat experience. They'd made their decision too. Knowing the odds were bad. Knowing they probably wouldn't survive. Making the call because it needed to be made.

> "Major," Chen said quietly, "make sure Earth Command understands what these ships represent. Not just tactically. Strategically. The Federation has a capability nobody else possesses. That won't change - there are no counter-measures except destroying the generating vessel itself."

> "I'll make sure they understand," Morse promised. "Though I suspect after the Battle of Sol, everyone's paying very close attention to tactical innovations."

The observation deck was nearly empty now, just Chen and Morse and the vast view of Jupiter beyond the shipyards. Somewhere out there, the Flycatcher was heading toward its patrol station. Somewhere closer, the Broadsword was adjusting course for Galileo Station.

And somewhere in the galaxy, the great races continued their eternal conflicts, unaware that humanity had developed something they'd never encountered in thousands of years of warfare. Something they had no defense against. Something they couldn't even conceptualize.

Chen allowed herself a small smile.

The Federation needed to use this advantage wisely.

> "Come on," she said to Morse. "We should get back to Galileo Station. I want to be there when Broadsword arrives."

> "Still not comfortable delegating?"

> "Not when it's my station." Chen headed toward the exit. "Besides, if we're getting a purpose-built warp disruption platform, I want to understand exactly how it works. Just in case I need to improvise again."

Morse followed her out, and the observation deck fell silent except for the faint hum of environmental systems. Outside, Jupiter turned in its eternal dance, storms larger than Earth itself swirling across its surface. And in orbit, two new warships moved toward their destiny.

Ships that would change everything.

Ships that the galaxy would never see coming.

Ships with a capability that had no counter except destruction.

### Galileo Station - Commander's Office
### Same day - 1845 hours

Chen stood at her office viewport, watching the Broadsword complete its final approach. The cruiser moved with ponderous grace, its mass requiring careful maneuvering as it positioned itself in the designated patrol orbit. Station traffic control was routing other vessels around the new arrival, clearing space for the ship that would become Galileo's permanent warp disruption platform.

> "Station approach complete," the Broadsword's captain reported over the comm channel. "Establishing patrol pattern. Gravity generator systems nominal. Ready to provide disruption coverage on your command."

> "Acknowledged, Broadsword," Chen replied. "Welcome to Galileo Station. Your presence is appreciated."

An understatement. Having a Broadsword class cruiser permanently stationed at Galileo meant Chen would never again face the situation she'd faced four months ago - watching hostile forces approach with no ability to prevent their escape. The Broadsword could maintain its disruption field indefinitely, creating a sphere of controlled space where Federation forces dictated terms.

Her desk terminal chimed. HARBINGER's interface appeared on the display.

> "Commander Chen. I have completed analysis of integrated defense posture with Broadsword deployment. Station defensive capability increased by forty-three percent. Probability of successful defense against Ryzak-level threat: ninety-four percent."

> "Better than improvised solutions?" Chen asked with slight amusement.

> "Significantly better. Purpose-built systems provide reliability that improvised solutions cannot match. Though I should note that your improvised solution at the Battle of Sol performed admirably under the circumstances."

> "High praise from an AI."

> "Factual assessment based on operational outcomes."

Chen pulled up the strategic overview on her terminal. The Sol system, marked with Federation positions. Earth orbit. Luna. Mars. The Belt. Jupiter. And now, two new icons - the Flycatcher patrolling the outer system, the Broadsword holding position at Galileo.

Ships that existed because she'd made one decision four months ago.

Ships that would change space warfare.

Ships that nobody in the galaxy saw coming.

Outside her viewport, the Broadsword settled into its patrol orbit, a silent guardian with a gravity generator capable of denying warp travel to any hostile force that approached Galileo Station. The station that had held the line at Jupiter. The station where everything had changed.

Chen thought about Patterson, Lee, and Vasquez. About three Earth pilots who'd bought her the time she needed. About the decisions people made under impossible pressure and the consequences that rippled outward from those moments.

And somewhere beyond CONCORD's protection zone, Ryzak leadership was trying to piece together what had happened to their fleet. Limited to guesswork and incomplete reports. Unable to investigate directly. Unable to learn the truth.

They would never know that the fundamental rules had changed.

That warp travel could be denied.

That humanity possessed a capability unlike any other.

Chen smiled slightly and returned to her work. The Sol system needed defending. Earth needed protecting. And now, finally, she had the tools to do both.
