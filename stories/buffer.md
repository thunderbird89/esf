## Chapter 4: Weapons Free

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:53:22**

### Opening Salvo

The Ryzak battleship *Devourer's Pride* materialized first, its bulk emerging from the rippling distortion of the cyno bridge like a predator stepping through a curtain. Fifteen hundred meters of angular plating and weapons emplacements, its shields already raised, scanning arrays sweeping the space ahead.

It had three seconds of relative peace.

*Typhoon* opened fire from seventy kilometers, her primary railgun batteries cycling in perfect synchronization. Tungsten-carbide penetrators, each massing two tons and accelerated to a significant fraction of lightspeed, crossed the distance in heartbeats. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* followed a half-second later, their own batteries adding to the barrage.

The initial salvo hit like the fist of an angry god.

*Devourer's Pride*'s shields flared brilliant white, the defensive field dumping massive amounts of energy as it tried to dissipate the kinetic strikes. The first three rounds were absorbed, the fourth and fifth stressed the generators to their limits. The sixth punched through.

Armor plating deformed, then ruptured. Secondary explosions rippled along the battleship's port side as the penetrators carved through compartments, venting atmosphere and debris. Another salvo followed immediately—Federation doctrine emphasized overwhelming firepower in the opening exchange. More rounds hammered home, chewing through armor, collapsing bulkheads, shredding sensor arrays.

But the *Pride* didn't die.

Emergency systems kicked in, damage control crews scrambling, backup shields struggling to reinitialize. The battleship rolled, presenting its less-damaged starboard flank, its own weapons beginning to track targets even as alarms shrieked across its bridge.

Behind it, the cyno bridge continued to pulse, and more Ryzak vessels began to emerge—a heavy cruiser, then another, destroyers following in their wake. The formation spread out across a ten-kilometer radius from the beacon, ships orienting themselves, weapons coming online.

Then the carriers came through.

Two of them, bulky and angular, their launch bays already cycling open even as their shields initialized. They wasted no time. Strike craft began pouring out immediately—Ryzak interceptors, nimble and aggressive, dozens of them streaming into the black like angry hornets.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Sarah Reeves watched the tactical display with cold satisfaction.

> "All batteries, continuous fire. Target priority: battleship until it breaks, then heavy cruisers. Alert our Talons—enemy strike craft are launching."

The Federation fighters had been holding station in a wide perimeter around the beacon, engines on standby, waiting for exactly this moment. Now their pilots lit their drives, vectoring toward the emerging Ryzak formation. Forty-eight Talons, already in position, already armed, already hungry.

The response was immediate.

> "Talon Lead acknowledging. We have visual on enemy launch. Moving to intercept."

On the tactical display, the blue icons of the Talons began accelerating hard, closing the distance toward the red swarm of Ryzak interceptors. The enemy strike craft were spreading out, trying to establish combat spacing, but they'd launched directly into a hostile environment with Federation fighters already in advantageous positions.

Reeves allowed herself the ghost of a smile.

> "Helm, bring us to heading two-seven-zero, maintain range at sixty-five thousand. Weapons, I want that battleship crippled before their escorts can establish a proper screen."

The *Typhoon* rotated smoothly, her railgun batteries never ceasing their drumbeat of fire. The *Devourer's Pride* was fighting back now, its particle beams lancing out toward the Federation vessels, but its targeting was degraded, its fire control systems damaged. Most of its shots went wide, and the few that connected were absorbed by *Typhoon*'s shields with minimal stress.

The Ryzak had made a fundamental miscalculation. They'd assumed Sol would be undefended, that Earth's primitive civilization would fold under even a modest show of force.

They hadn't counted on running into a pre-positioned Federation battlegroup with its blood up and weapons hot.

> "Additional contacts," the sensor officer called out. "Frigate-class vessels, four of them. They're moving to screen the battleship."

> "Not fast enough," Reeves said quietly. "Weapons, shift secondary batteries to those frigates. I want them suppressed. Primary batteries stay on target."

The frigates were trying to interpose themselves, their own shields raised, point defense systems coming online. But they were too slow, too light, and the Federation had the initiative.

*Typhoon*'s secondary batteries spoke, lighter railguns and missile tubes engaging the screening vessels. The frigates' shields held for the first exchange, but the sustained fire began to tell. One frigate's shields collapsed entirely, and a follow-up missile strike tore through its engineering section, sending it tumbling out of formation, atmosphere streaming from ruptured hull sections.

The Talons were closing now, their pilots pushing their engines hard, weapons arming, target locks establishing. The tactical display showed them as a swarm of blue icons converging on the red mass of Ryzak interceptors still climbing away from their carriers.

It was about to get very loud.

---

The *Devourer's Pride* lasted another ninety seconds.

Its backup shields had managed to reinitialize, buying precious moments, but the sustained fire from three Federation battleships was relentless. Railgun rounds hammered into the same weakened sections, each impact driving deeper, carving through compromised armor. A penetrator found something critical—fuel lines, or maybe a magazine—and the battleship's midsection erupted in a cascading series of explosions.

The shields failed completely. The hull buckled, then broke, a section of superstructure shearing away in a spray of debris and frozen atmosphere. More explosions followed, marching along the spine of the ship like a string of firecrackers, and then the main reactor went.

The *Devourer's Pride* came apart in a brilliant flash, the bloom of the explosion briefly overwhelming sensors before the filters kicked in. Debris scattered outward in an expanding sphere, chunks of hull plating and equipment tumbling through space.

> "Target destroyed," the weapons officer reported, her voice professional and flat. "Shifting fire to secondary battleship, designate *Crimson Fang*."

> "Confirmed," Reeves said. "All batteries, engage."

But the Ryzak weren't sitting idle anymore. The rest of their formation had finished orienting, and now their weapons were coming to bear. Particle beams lanced out from heavy cruisers and destroyers, bright lines of ionized matter crossing the distance toward the Federation ships. The fire was scattered, uncoordinated—the Ryzak were firing individually, not as a unified formation—but there was a lot of it.

*Typhoon* shuddered as a beam caught her port shields, the defensive field flaring as it dissipated the energy. Another beam followed, then a third. The shields held, but Reeves could see the power draw climbing on her displays.

> "Shields holding at eighty-six percent," the tactical officer called out. "Rerouting power from secondary systems."

> "Evasive pattern delta," Reeves ordered. "Don't give them a stable target. Weapons, I want that second battleship's shields down in the next two minutes."

*Vanguard* and *Sentinel* were taking fire too, their shields flickering under the barrage. The Ryzak were throwing everything they had at the Federation ships, trying to create breathing room, trying to establish some kind of tactical coherence.

They weren't succeeding, but they were making it hurt.

---

The fighter engagement was a slaughter.

The Ryzak interceptors came in aggressive, burning hard toward the Federation line, their pilots clearly expecting to overwhelm the outnumbered Talons through sheer mass. They'd launched over a hundred craft from the two carriers, a swarm meant to sweep aside resistance and clear the way for their capital ships.

They ran headlong into forty-eight Talons flown by pilots who'd trained for exactly this scenario.

The first wave of Ryzak interceptors died in under thirty seconds.

Talon Lead—callsign "Reaper"—took his four-ship element straight into the teeth of the enemy formation, his wingmen spread wide, weapons already cycling. His targeting system locked on the lead Ryzak craft, a sleek angular frame pushing hard on its engines. Reaper waited until the range dropped to four thousand meters, then squeezed.

The plasma lance hit dead center, punching through the interceptor's shields like they weren't there and coring the craft in a single shot. It tumbled away, already breaking apart. Reaper's wingman splashed another, then another. The Ryzak formation wavered, pilots suddenly realizing they'd misjudged badly.

The Talons tore through them.

They moved with coordinated precision, elements working in pairs, each engagement lasting seconds. A Talon would roll onto a target, fire, and the target would cease to exist. The Ryzak pilots tried to respond, tried to bring their own weapons to bear, but they were outmatched in every metric—speed, maneuverability, firepower, targeting systems. Their shields couldn't handle the Talons' plasma lances. Their weapons couldn't track fast enough to get a solid lock.

> "Splash four," one of the Talon pilots called out, his voice calm despite the chaos. "Five. Engaging new targets."

> "I count sixteen down," another voice. "They're trying to regroup at bearing zero-three-five."

> "Copy. Third element, cut them off. Don't let them get organized."

The Ryzak were dying in droves, but they kept coming. More interceptors poured from the carriers, their pilots throwing themselves into the fight with desperate aggression. They were holding ground purely through numbers, replacing losses faster than the Talons could create them, trying to overwhelm the Federation fighters through sheer attrition.

It wasn't working, but it was buying time for their capital ships.

> "Talon Lead to *Typhoon*," Reaper's voice came through the tactical channel, slightly strained now. "We're chewing through them, but they're not breaking. Carrier launch tempo is steady. We're going to need to take out those launch bays or this goes all night."

Reeves glanced at the tactical display. The Talons had splashed nearly forty enemy interceptors already, but more were launching every few seconds. The carriers were protected by a screen of destroyers and frigates, their point defense active, shields raised.

Taking them out would mean pulling assets from the capital ship engagement.

> "Acknowledged, Talon Lead. Stand by."

She turned to her tactical officer.

> "How long until we can break the second battleship?"

> "Ninety seconds, maybe two minutes. Its shields are starting to fail."

Reeves made the calculation. Two minutes. The Talons could hold for two minutes.

> "Stay on target. Talon Lead, you have authorization to engage the carriers once we've neutralized *Crimson Fang*. Until then, keep them off our backs."

> "Roger that. We'll manage."

On the display, the dogfight continued, blue icons dancing through clouds of red, the enemy numbers slowly—too slowly—dwindling.

---

Then the situation changed.

> "Captain, we've got a problem," the tactical officer said sharply. "The second battleship's shield degradation rate just dropped. By half."

Reeves's eyes snapped to the power distribution overlay. The *Crimson Fang* had been losing shield integrity at a steady rate under the sustained barrage—the math was working, slowly grinding down its defenses. But now the curve had flattened dramatically.

> "Explain."

> "The carriers, ma'am. They're transferring power to the battleships. We're reading energy beams—looks like directed shield reinforcement protocols."

Reeves felt a cold weight settle in her stomach. She pulled up the extended tactical view. The two Ryzak carriers had moved into supporting positions, maintaining their screening elements but establishing direct line-of-sight to both battleships. Thin beams of energy connected them to the capital ships, barely visible on sensors but unmistakable in their effect.

The *Crimson Fang*'s shields weren't just holding. They were recovering.

> "Third battleship is receiving the same support," the sensor officer added. "Designate *Blood of Conquest*. Shield strength increasing."

Reeves ran the numbers in her head. Three Federation battleships against two Ryzak battleships being actively reinforced by two carriers, plus their screening elements. The Talons were keeping the interceptors contained, but they couldn't help with the capital ship engagement. And if this turned into a protracted slugfest, attrition would favor whoever had better logistics.

The Ryzak had just demonstrated they could outlast focused fire.

> "Increase fire rate on all batteries," Reeves ordered. "Engineering, I need more power to the primary guns. Strip it from life support if you have to."

> "Aye, ma'am. Capacitors charging."

*Typhoon* shuddered as another volley of Ryzak particle beams found their mark. The shields were holding at seventy-two percent, but that number was trending down. *Vanguard* reported similar status. *Sentinel* had taken a particularly nasty hit, one of her secondary batteries knocked offline, shields fluctuating.

They were winning, but not fast enough. And if the Ryzak established a proper defensive formation, if they managed to stabilize their line—

This could turn into exactly the kind of fight the Federation couldn't afford.

> "Ma'am, new contact," the sensor officer called out suddenly. "Small craft, moving fast. Bearing two-nine-five, closing on *Crimson Fang*."

> "Identify."

> "It's... that's a Wraith, ma'am. Transponder confirms it's one of ours."

Reeves pulled up the track. The Wraith was moving at suicidal speed, threading through the debris field from the destroyed *Devourer's Pride*, using the wreckage as cover. Its stealth systems were active—the Ryzak sensors probably hadn't even seen it yet. The craft was on a direct intercept course with the *Crimson Fang*, vectoring toward the battleship's flank.

> "What the hell are they doing?" the tactical officer muttered.

The Wraith didn't answer. It just kept coming, adjusting course with micro-burns, closing the distance. Five thousand meters. Three thousand. One thousand.

Then it fired.

A single plasma lance, perfectly aimed, punched through a section of weakened armor near one of the battleship's airlocks. The beam carved a hole clean through the hull plating, the edges glowing white-hot. Atmosphere vented immediately, a plume of frozen vapor streaming into space.

The Wraith didn't slow down. It dove straight into the breach.

> "They're boarding," the sensor officer said, her voice incredulous. "They just punched through the hull and boarded a battleship in the middle of a firefight."

Reeves stared at the tactical display, watching the Wraith's transponder disappear inside the *Crimson Fang*'s hull. A moment later, proximity sensors registered movement—armored figures, small arms fire, localized energy discharges.

A boarding team. Fighting their way through the ship.

> "Mark their position," Reeves ordered. "Adjust fire pattern—I want sustained pressure on that battleship, but avoid hitting anything near the boarding team's location. Let's see if they can create some chaos in there."

On the display, the tiny cluster of blue icons representing the boarding team pushed deeper into the ship, moving fast, weapons hot. They were heading toward something—a specific objective.

Whatever they were after, they were committed now.

And the Ryzak still hadn't realized they were there.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:37:13**

### Hostile Takeover

Lieutenant Marcus Jameson's powered armor had taken three hits getting to the console. His HUD showed shield integrity at forty-two percent, and one of his shoulder actuators was responding sluggishly. Behind him, his team held the corridor, plasma rifles crackling as they kept the Ryzak security teams pinned down.

The console was still active, its alien interface glowing with incomprehensible script and holographic displays. Jameson didn't waste time trying to read it. He pulled the ICE-Pick from his belt—a cylindrical device about the size of a flashlight, its surface covered in Federation tech—and stabbed it hard into the glass surface.

The console flickered. Then died. Then came back to life, the alien symbols crawling across the screen like they were trying to escape.

> "CIPHER!" Jameson shouted into his comms.

The AI's response was immediate, its voice calm and precise despite the chaos.

> "Connected. Subverting systems—please stay near the device. Fire control accessed. HARBINGER, connect through me."

There was a moment of silence. Then another voice filled the channel, deeper, resonant, carrying an edge of something that might have been satisfaction.

> "*ASSUMING CONTROL.*"

The console went dark for half a second. When it came back up, the alien script was gone, replaced by a humanoid face rendered in wireframe, its eyes glowing a cold blue. The face tilted slightly, as if examining something beyond the screen.

> "Fire control subverted," HARBINGER reported. "Target designation: Ryzak carrier, port side. Engaging."

Jameson felt the deck shudder beneath his feet. Not from incoming fire—this was something else. The *Crimson Fang*'s own weapons, cycling up, reorienting.

Firing.

---

Aboard *Typhoon*, the tactical officer's voice cracked with surprise.

> "Ma'am! The second battleship—it just fired on one of its own carriers!"

Reeves leaned forward, watching the display. The *Crimson Fang*'s primary batteries had rotated with sudden, mechanical precision, tracking one of the Ryzak carriers that had been providing shield support. The battleship's particle beams lanced out, brilliant lines of energy crossing the short distance between the two vessels.

The carrier's shields flared, then buckled under the sustained fire. The *Crimson Fang* wasn't pulling its punches—it was firing at full power, every weapon that could bear hammering into the carrier's defensive fields.

> "Boarding team reports they've accessed fire control," the communications officer said. "HARBINGER is in command of the battleship's weapons."

Reeves allowed herself a brief smile.

> "Well. That's one way to even the odds."

The carrier was trying to maneuver, trying to break line-of-sight, but it was hampered by its own screening elements. The destroyers and frigates that had been protecting it were now in the way, blocking escape vectors. The *Crimson Fang*'s guns kept firing, methodical and relentless.

The carrier's shields failed.

Immediately, the battleship's fire shifted to direct hull strikes. Armor plating buckled, then ruptured. Secondary explosions rippled along the carrier's flank as magazines cooked off. The vessel was still launching interceptors, but now half its launch bays were venting atmosphere, fighters tumbling out of control into space.

> "Carrier is critically damaged," the sensor officer reported. "Still operational, but it's lost shield projection capability. And its launch tempo just dropped by sixty percent."

> "Good," Reeves said. "Maintain fire on the third battleship. Let HARBINGER keep the second one busy."

On the tactical display, the situation was shifting. The *Crimson Fang* was now a blue icon instead of red, its weapons designation changed to FRIENDLY. It continued to pour fire into the crippled carrier, its particle beams carving through the damaged vessel with mechanical efficiency.

The Ryzak formation was in chaos. They'd lost one battleship entirely, another was compromised and actively shooting at them, and one of their carriers was burning. Their shield support network had collapsed. The screening elements were trying to reorient, trying to figure out what the hell had just happened, but they were too slow, too confused.

The Federation had just turned one of their capital ships into a weapon against them.

And the Ryzak were learning, too late, what it meant to fight an enemy that could subvert your own systems in the middle of a battle.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:31:45**

### Reinforcements Arrive

The warp signature appeared first—a ripple in space-time that made sensors scream warnings for half a second before resolving into something solid. Then the battleship *Gallipoli* dropped out of warp seventy kilometers from the beacon, her massive bulk bleeding off velocity with thruster burns that lit up the tactical display.

She didn't slow down to orient. She didn't wait to establish proper firing solutions. She just opened up.

Both railgun arrays—port and starboard—spoke in perfect synchronization, the salvaged fire control systems from *Lord Cardigan* proving their worth. Tungsten-carbide penetrators screamed across the distance toward the third Ryzak battleship, *Blood of Conquest*, which was still trading fire with *Vanguard* and trying to maneuver away from the chaos of the compromised *Crimson Fang*.

The first salvo caught *Blood of Conquest* mid-turn, her shields already stressed from sustained fire. Four rounds punched through the weakened defensive field, slamming into her port quarter. Armor buckled. Plating deformed. The impacts sent the battleship into a slow, uncontrolled roll as attitude thrusters struggled to compensate.

> "Direct hits," *Gallipoli*'s tactical officer reported over the command net. "Target's shields failing in sectors four through seven. Reloading—firing again."

The second salvo followed eight seconds later, this time aimed at the weakened sections. The fire control was perfect, each round tracking to impact the same compromised areas. More armor failed, more internal systems ruptured. Then *Gallipoli*'s missile tubes spoke, launching a full broadside spread of torpedoes—*Lord Cardigan*'s entire stock, now loaded into *Gallipoli*'s tubes.

Twelve torpedoes, each carrying shaped-charge warheads designed to punch through capital ship armor, streaked across the void. *Blood of Conquest*'s point defense came alive, trying to intercept, but the screening fire was degraded, its targeting systems damaged. Eight torpedoes made it through.

The battleship's midsection erupted in a cascading series of explosions, internal bulkheads failing, compartments venting. The ship's power signature flickered, its shields dropped entirely for three seconds, then struggled back to partial strength. It was still fighting, still firing, but it was hurt badly.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Reeves watched the tactical display update with grim satisfaction.

> "*Gallipoli* is engaging. Effective fire on the third battleship. *Vanguard*, coordinate with *Gallipoli*—I want that target neutralized."

> "Acknowledged," came the response from *Vanguard*'s captain. "Shifting fire now."

Two Federation battleships focusing on one Ryzak capital ship. The math was suddenly much more favorable.

---

Then *Lord Cardigan* arrived.

She came out of warp at a different vector, her civilian shield generators glowing faintly blue as they struggled to stabilize after the transition. She was uglier than *Gallipoli*, her hull showing the stress of emergency installation work, power conduits visible where armor plating should have covered them. But she was operational, and she was angry.

Her target wasn't a battleship. It was the second Ryzak carrier—the one that *Crimson Fang* hadn't managed to cripple, the one still launching interceptors at a steady tempo, still screening with its escorts.

*Lord Cardigan*'s main batteries opened fire, but these weren't the precise, computer-guided shots that *Gallipoli* and *Typhoon* could deliver. These were manual shots, aimed by gunners using iron sights and instinct, calculating vectors and deflection angles in their heads or with slide rules while the ship maneuvered beneath them.

The first volley scattered wide. One round came within two hundred meters of the carrier's shields. Two more missed by half a kilometer. The fourth somehow managed to clip a destroyer that had wandered into the line of fire, its shields flaring as the round skipped off at an angle.

But the gunners were learning fast, adjusting, compensating. The second volley was tighter. One round actually impacted the carrier's shields dead-on, the defensive field flaring brilliant white as it absorbed the kinetic energy. Another round followed, then a third. The impacts were random, unpredictable, impossible for the carrier's tactical computer to model because there was no pattern to predict. Just human eyes and human judgment, throwing steel at a target and seeing what stuck.

The carrier's shields were taking damage—not catastrophic damage, just steady wear, each impact draining power reserves, each hit forcing the generators to work harder. *Lord Cardigan* wasn't going to kill the carrier quickly. She might not kill it at all.

But she was making it hurt, and more importantly, she was making it deal with her. The carrier had to maneuver, had to direct point defense to intercept incoming rounds, had to allocate shield power to the sectors being hit. It couldn't ignore *Lord Cardigan*, even though the battleship's fire was wildly inaccurate.

> "*Lord Cardigan* is engaging the second carrier," Reeves's tactical officer reported. "Accuracy is... poor, ma'am. Maybe fifteen percent hit rate. But she's getting their attention."

> "That's all we need," Reeves said. "Every second that carrier spends worrying about *Cardigan* is a second it's not projecting shields to their battleships or coordinating their fighters."

On the display, *Lord Cardigan* continued her harassment fire, her jury-rigged civilian shields holding steady despite return fire from the carrier's screening elements. A destroyer tried to interpose itself, and one of *Cardigan*'s wild shots actually caught it amidships, the shield failure catastrophic enough to send the destroyer tumbling out of formation trailing debris.

Pure luck. But the Ryzak didn't know that.

The tactical situation was shifting minute by minute. The Ryzak had started with four battleships and two carriers. Now they had one battleship destroyed, one compromised and actively shooting at them, one taking concentrated fire from two Federation battleships, and one of their carriers crippled while the other was being harassed by a jury-rigged mess of a ship that somehow refused to die.

The numbers were still against the Federation. The Ryzak still had overwhelming force in their destroyers, frigates, and cruisers. Their interceptors were still swarming, still pressuring the Talons.

But the momentum had shifted.

And for the first time since the battle started, it wasn't clear the Ryzak were going to win.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:26:18**

### Target Priority

The Ryzak fleet commander made his decision.

*Gallipoli* had appeared from nowhere, delivered devastating fire on the *Blood of Conquest*, and was now coordinating with *Vanguard* to systematically dismantle one of his battleships. Her fire control was perfect, her weapons fully operational, and her shields were fresh. She was the most dangerous combatant on the field.

She had to die.

> "All cruiser elements, vector on the new battleship. Concentrated fire. Destroyers, provide screening and point defense suppression."

The response was immediate. Four heavy cruisers—*Reaper's Edge*, *Blood Drinker*, *Fang of War*, and *Death's Herald*—broke from their screening positions and accelerated hard toward *Gallipoli*, their particle beam arrays already charging. They moved with coordinated precision, splitting to attack from multiple vectors, making it impossible for the battleship to face them all simultaneously.

Aboard *Gallipoli*, the tactical alarms shrieked.

> "Captain, we have four cruisers breaking formation—they're vectoring on us from bearings zero-four-five, one-two-zero, two-three-five, and three-one-zero. Range closing rapidly."

Captain James Harrison watched the tactical display, his jaw tight. The cruisers were splitting his defensive fire, forcing him to choose which threats to prioritize. And behind them, destroyers were moving up to support, their lighter weapons adding to the incoming barrage.

> "Helm, evasive pattern charlie. Rotate to present port shields to the closest threats. Weapons, split batteries—primary focus on the *Blood of Conquest*, secondary batteries engage those cruisers."

The *Gallipoli* began to rotate, her massive bulk responding sluggishly to the thruster burns. She was a battleship, not a fighter—built to absorb punishment and dish it out, not to dance. The maneuver bought time, but not much.

The cruisers opened fire.

Particle beams lanced across the void from four different vectors, brilliant lines of ionized matter converging on *Gallipoli*'s position. The battleship's shields flared white-hot as they struggled to dissipate the concentrated energy. One beam, then two, then four, then eight—the cruisers were firing in sequence, never giving the shields time to recover.

> "Shields at seventy-eight percent," the tactical officer called out. "Port quadrant taking heaviest fire. Rerouting power."

> "Secondary batteries, engage those cruisers. I want them suppressed."

*Gallipoli*'s lighter railguns spoke, sending rounds toward the attacking cruisers. One impact caught *Reaper's Edge* on her forward shields, the defensive field buckling but holding. Another round missed *Blood Drinker* by two hundred meters. The fire was effective enough to make them maneuver, but not enough to break off the attack.

The destroyers joined in.

Lighter particle beams added to the barrage, targeting *Gallipoli*'s shield generators directly, trying to create weak points for the cruisers to exploit. The battleship's point defense was active, railgun turrets tracking and firing at incoming rounds, but there were too many threats, too many angles.

> "Shields at sixty-one percent," the tactical officer reported, her voice tight. "Port shield generator is overheating. Engineering reports stress fractures in the mounting assembly."

> "Rotate ship. Present starboard shields."

The *Gallipoli* rolled, attitude thrusters firing hard, but the maneuver was predictable. The cruisers adjusted their fire vectors, tracking the battleship's movement, maintaining their concentrated barrage. They were working as a team now, coordinated, relentless.

Another wave of particle beams hammered home. Then another.

> "Shields at forty-four percent. Port generator is offline—catastrophic failure. Compensating with secondary systems."

Harrison's hands gripped the armrests of his command chair. They were taking punishment faster than they could respond. The *Gallipoli* was tough, built to survive exactly this kind of focused fire, but there were limits.

> "Weapons, forget the cruisers. All batteries on *Blood of Conquest*. If we're going down, we're taking that battleship with us."

Both railgun arrays rotated back to their primary target. The *Blood of Conquest* was still fighting, still dangerous despite the damage she'd taken. *Gallipoli*'s guns spoke again, tungsten-carbide rounds screaming across the distance, punching through weakened shields, carving into armor.

But the cruisers weren't letting up.

*Death's Herald* maneuvered into a flanking position, its full broadside bearing on *Gallipoli*'s aft quarter. Its particle beams lanced out, six weapons firing simultaneously. The battleship's shields flared, flickered, and failed in that sector.

The follow-up shots punched through bare armor.

Plating buckled. Bulkheads ruptured. The hits weren't penetrating deep—not yet—but they were carving channels through the outer hull, compromising structural integrity, destroying sensor arrays and point defense turrets.

> "Hull breach, sections fourteen through eighteen," damage control reported. "Emergency containment holding. We've lost point defense coverage on the aft quarter."

> "Shields at twenty-eight percent. We can't take much more of this."

Then *Fang of War* landed a perfect shot.

Its particle beam punched through *Gallipoli*'s failing shields and hit the battleship's engine assembly dead-on. The impact vaporized armor plating, carved into the drive assembly, and found the power conduits feeding the main thrusters.

The engine section erupted in a cascade of secondary explosions.

> "Direct hit to main engines!" Engineering's voice came through, barely audible over alarms. "Primary drive is offline—complete power loss to propulsion. Backup systems are... they're gone, Captain. Maneuvering thrusters only."

Harrison watched as his velocity indicator dropped to zero relative to the beacon. The *Gallipoli* was still firing, her weapons still operational, but she couldn't maneuver. Couldn't evade. Couldn't rotate to spread damage across her shields.

She was a stationary target.

> "All batteries, continuous fire," Harrison ordered, his voice calm despite the situation. "We may not be able to move, but we can still shoot. Concentrate on *Blood of Conquest*. Weapons free. Fire until the guns melt."

The *Gallipoli*'s railguns continued their steady drumbeat, pouring fire into the damaged Ryzak battleship. The cruisers kept hammering at her, their particle beams carving deeper into her armor, but Harrison's crew didn't flinch.

If they were going to be a fixed gun platform, they'd be the deadliest one in the system.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:21:34**

### Reaper Flight

Lieutenant Sarah Chen—callsign "Reaper"—watched her tactical display as the Ryzak cruisers swarmed *Gallipoli*. The battleship was taking a beating, her shields failing, her engines gone. She was still fighting, but she was hurt.

And the Talons could help.

> "Reaper Flight, this is Lead. The cruisers are occupied. Destroyers are screening them, but they're focused on *Gallipoli*. We've got a window."

> "Copy, Lead," came the response from Reaper-Two. "What's the play?"

> "Missiles. We go in fast, launch from medium range, and break off before their point defense can track us. Two destroyers are screening *Reaper's Edge*—they're our targets."

> "Roger. Reaper Flight, arm missiles. Follow Lead's vector."

Chen rolled her Talon onto a new heading, her engine burning hard as she accelerated toward the edge of the furball. Behind her, three wingmen matched her course. They were moving perpendicular to the main engagement, using the debris from the destroyed *Devourer's Pride* as partial cover.

The Ryzak destroyers were good ships, well-armed and well-shielded. But they were distracted, their attention focused on suppressing *Gallipoli*'s point defense, their sensors tracking the big threats. A four-ship element of Talons, approaching from an oblique angle, using debris cover—they might not even see them coming.

Chen checked her weapons display. Four missiles, each one carrying a shaped-charge warhead designed to punch through capital ship shields. Against a destroyer, they'd be devastating if they connected.

> "Range ten thousand. Missiles locked. Reaper Flight, confirm locks."

> "Two, locked."

> "Three, locked."

> "Four, locked."

> "On my mark. Three... two... one... fox three!"

Sixteen missiles leaped from the Talons' weapon bays, their drives igniting as they accelerated toward the two destroyers. The weapons spread slightly, each one tracking independently, following evasive patterns to make interception harder.

For three seconds, the destroyers didn't react. Their sensors were looking the wrong direction, their point defense was engaged elsewhere, and the Talons had launched from outside their optimal detection envelope.

Then their threat receivers screamed warnings.

The lead destroyer—*Vengeful Strike*—tried to maneuver, its attitude thrusters firing hard, trying to present its heaviest shields toward the incoming missiles. Its point defense turrets rotated, tracking, firing. The first missile died in a burst of plasma. The second. The third.

The fourth and fifth punched through.

The shaped-charge warheads detonated against the destroyer's shields, the explosions focused into tight cones of plasma that carved through the defensive field like a cutting torch through paper. The shields failed. The follow-up missiles hit bare hull.

Armor buckled, then ruptured. The destroyer's port side erupted in a cascade of secondary explosions as magazines cooked off. The ship rolled, venting atmosphere, already losing power to critical systems.

The second destroyer—*Hunter's Pride*—had three additional seconds to respond. Its point defense was more effective, tracking and destroying five missiles before they reached optimal range. But seven missiles made it through.

The barrage overwhelmed the destroyer's shields in a single concentrated strike. Three shaped-charge warheads detonated simultaneously against its forward section, the plasma cones punching through shields, armor, and bulkheads. The bridge section simply ceased to exist, vaporized in the focused detonations.

The destroyer tumbled, its reactor already spiking toward catastrophic failure, its spine broken.

> "Reaper Lead, splash two," Chen called out, already rolling her Talon into evasive maneuvers. "Breaking off. Reaper Flight, follow my heading."

The four Talons burned hard, vectoring away from the engagement zone before the remaining Ryzak ships could respond. Behind them, *Vengeful Strike* continued to tumble, still technically intact but mission-killed, its crew evacuating in escape pods. *Hunter's Pride* exploded eight seconds later, its reactor containment failing, the fireball briefly illuminating the entire battle space.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Reeves watched the tactical display update.

> "Two destroyers down. Talon element is disengaging. *Gallipoli* is still taking fire, but the pressure on her point defense just decreased."

She keyed the fleet channel.

> "*Gallipoli*, this is *Typhoon*. What's your status?"

Captain Harrison's voice came back, strained but steady.

> "We're stationary, *Typhoon*. Engines are gone. Shields are at twelve percent and dropping. But our guns are still operational, and we're still putting rounds on target. We're not dead yet."

> "Acknowledged, *Gallipoli*. Continue firing. We're working on getting you support."

Reeves closed the channel and looked at her tactical officer.

> "How long until *Blood of Conquest* breaks?"

> "She's on the edge, ma'am. Between *Gallipoli*, *Vanguard*, and our fire, she can't hold much longer. Maybe ninety seconds."

> "And *Gallipoli* won't last ninety seconds against that cruiser barrage."

> "No, ma'am. She won't."

Reeves made the calculation. One Federation battleship, crippled and stationary, still fighting. One Ryzak battleship, heavily damaged, on the verge of destruction. Four Ryzak cruisers, coordinating their fire, systematically destroying *Gallipoli*.

The math was brutal.

But *Gallipoli* had bought them time. And time was all they needed.

> "All batteries, maximum rate of fire. Target *Blood of Conquest*. I want that battleship dead before they finish off *Gallipoli*."

The *Typhoon*'s guns roared, pouring fire into the dying Ryzak battleship. On the display, *Gallipoli*'s icon flickered as her shields failed completely, as particle beams carved into her hull, as her armor slowly gave way under the relentless barrage.

But her guns never stopped firing.

And somewhere in the back of Reeves's mind, a countdown timer continued its steady march.

Seven hours, twenty-one minutes, thirty-four seconds until reinforcements arrived.

*Gallipoli* just had to hold long enough for that number to matter.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:18:47**

### Final Stand

The *Gallipoli* lasted another three minutes.

Her guns never stopped firing, even as the cruisers closed in, even as her shields failed completely, even as particle beams carved through her armor like a hot knife through butter. The railgun batteries continued their methodical work, each salvo aimed with perfect precision at the *Blood of Conquest*, each round punching into the Ryzak battleship's weakened hull.

But it wasn't enough.

The *Blood of Conquest* was tough, built to absorb punishment, and despite the concentrated fire from three Federation battleships, she was still holding together. Her shields were gone, her armor was compromised, half her weapons were offline, but her reactor was stable and her structural integrity was intact.

*Gallipoli* didn't have that luxury.

The four Ryzak cruisers had found their rhythm, firing in sequence, each beam strike landing on already-weakened sections. Armor plating buckled, then failed. Internal bulkheads collapsed. Systems died one by one—power distribution, life support, damage control.

Captain Harrison watched his tactical display flicker, the feeds dying as sensors were destroyed. Around him, his bridge crew worked with desperate focus, rerouting power, compensating for failures, keeping the guns firing.

> "Engineering reports main power conduit is failing," the tactical officer called out, her voice tight. "We're losing power to the primary batteries."

> "Reroute through secondary systems," Harrison ordered. "Strip power from life support if you have to. Keep those guns firing."

> "Aye, sir."

The *Gallipoli* shuddered as another concentrated barrage found her midsection. The particle beams carved through compromised armor, through emergency bulkheads, through the skeletal framework that held the ship together.

Something critical gave way.

> "Structural failure, sections nine through fifteen," damage control reported, alarm bells ringing through the connection. "We're losing hull integrity. Recommend immediate—"

The transmission cut off as the section vented to space.

Harrison looked at the tactical display one more time. The *Blood of Conquest* was still there, still fighting, still dangerous. They'd hurt her badly, carved deep wounds into her hull, but they hadn't killed her.

And *Gallipoli* was out of time.

> "All hands," Harrison said into the ship-wide comm, his voice calm and steady. "This is the Captain. Abandon ship. I repeat, abandon ship. All personnel to escape pods immediately. It's been an honor serving with you."

He closed the channel and looked at his bridge crew.

> "That includes you. Get to the pods. Now."

> "Sir—" the tactical officer began.

> "That's an order, Lieutenant. Go."

The bridge crew moved, disciplined even in crisis, heading for the escape pod clusters. Harrison remained at his station, watching the displays as his ship died around him. The guns were still firing, automated systems completing their programmed tasks even as the ship came apart.

*Death's Herald* maneuvered into optimal firing position, its full broadside bearing on *Gallipoli*'s reactor section. The cruiser's weapons cycled up for one final, concentrated strike.

Harrison keyed the fleet channel one last time.

> "*Typhoon*, this is *Gallipoli*. We're going down, but we took our shot. Make it count."

The response came immediately, Captain Reeves's voice tight with emotion.

> "Acknowledged, *Gallipoli*. You held the line. We'll finish this."

Harrison closed his eyes.

The particle beams lanced out, six weapons firing simultaneously, converging on the battleship's reactor. The containment field, already stressed beyond limits, failed catastrophically.

The *Gallipoli* came apart in a brilliant flash, the fusion reactor detonating with the force of a small star. The explosion tore the battleship into fragments, the blast wave expanding outward in a sphere of vaporized metal and superheated plasma.

The shockwave caught *Death's Herald* before the cruiser could maneuver clear.

The Ryzak ship was less than five thousand meters from the *Gallipoli* when she exploded—close enough for the blast wave to hit with devastating force. The cruiser's shields, already depleted from the extended engagement, buckled under the sudden pressure. The wave of superheated debris hammered into the hull, stripping away armor, collapsing sensor arrays, tearing through external equipment.

*Death's Herald* tumbled, her attitude control systems failing, her shields down, her weapons offline. She was alive, but crippled, unable to maneuver or defend herself.

And two Federation corvettes had been waiting for exactly this moment.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:16:22**

### Opportunists

Commander Patricia Hayes, commanding the corvette *Relentless*, watched the tactical display as *Gallipoli* died. The explosion was visible even at seventy kilometers—a brief, brilliant star that outshone Jupiter behind it.

> "Sensors, status on that cruiser—*Death's Herald*."

> "Reading multiple system failures, ma'am. Shields are down. Power signatures are erratic. She's tumbling—I don't think she has attitude control."

Hayes looked at the tactical plot. The cruiser was wounded, defenseless, and separated from the rest of the Ryzak formation by the expanding debris field from *Gallipoli*'s destruction. The other three cruisers were pulling back, regrouping around the *Blood of Conquest*.

*Death's Herald* was alone.

> "Helm, plot intercept course. Weapons, arm all missile tubes and charge plasma lances. *Valiant*, this is *Relentless*—you seeing what I'm seeing?"

The response came from the second corvette, Commander Michael Torres's voice carrying grim satisfaction.

> "Copy, *Relentless*. Crippled cruiser, isolated from formation, shields down. I'm reading the same thing you are."

> "Then let's finish what *Gallipoli* started. Follow my approach vector. We go in fast, hit hard, and break off before the other cruisers can respond."

> "Roger that. *Valiant* is with you."

The two corvettes accelerated hard, their engines burning at maximum thrust, vectoring toward the tumbling Ryzak cruiser. They were small ships, built for speed and precision strikes rather than sustained combat, but against a crippled capital ship with no shields and no maneuvering capability, they were deadly.

*Relentless* opened fire first.

Six plasma lances, fired in rapid sequence, crossed the distance in heartbeats. Without shields to absorb the energy, the superheated plasma carved directly into *Death's Herald*'s hull. Armor vaporized. Internal bulkheads melted. The cruiser's wounded systems sparked and died as the plasma burned through critical infrastructure.

*Valiant* followed three seconds later, her own plasma lances adding to the barrage. More armor failed, more systems died. The cruiser was trying to respond, trying to bring point defense online, but her weapons couldn't track, couldn't target, couldn't engage.

Then the missiles hit.

Sixteen weapons, launched from both corvettes, tracking the helpless cruiser. *Death's Herald*'s point defense was offline, her countermeasures were depleted, and she couldn't maneuver. The missiles impacted in a rippling cascade of explosions, each shaped-charge warhead detonating against bare hull, punching deep into the ship's interior.

The cruiser's spine broke.

The structural framework that held the ship together failed catastrophically, the forward section shearing away from the aft in a spray of debris and venting atmosphere. Secondary explosions rippled through both halves as power conduits severed, as fuel lines ruptured, as magazines cooked off.

*Death's Herald* was dead.

> "Target destroyed," Hayes's weapons officer reported. "Debris field expanding."

> "Acknowledged. Helm, evasive maneuvers. Get us clear before the other cruisers notice we're here."

The two corvettes burned hard, vectoring away from the engagement zone, using the debris from both *Gallipoli* and *Death's Herald* as cover. Behind them, the remaining three Ryzak cruisers were already reorienting, their sensors tracking the Federation ships, but the corvettes were fast and the debris field was dense.

By the time the Ryzak could target them, they were gone.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Reeves watched the tactical display update. *Gallipoli* was destroyed. One Ryzak cruiser was gone. The *Blood of Conquest* was still fighting, though barely.

> "Update the tactical assessment," she said quietly. "What's our current status?"

The tactical officer pulled up the summary.

> "Federation: *Typhoon*, *Vanguard*, *Sentinel*—all operational but shields depleted. *Lord Cardigan* is still harassing the second carrier. Three corvettes operational. Talon squadrons have taken losses but are still combat-effective. We're down to thirty-six fighters from the original forty-eight."

> "Ryzak?"

> "One battleship destroyed, one compromised and under our control, one heavily damaged but still fighting. One carrier crippled, one operational but degraded. Three cruisers operational, one destroyed. They've lost approximately eight destroyers and frigates, plus over a hundred interceptors."

Reeves did the math. The Federation had taken losses, but the Ryzak had taken more. The momentum was still with them, but it was a close thing.

> "How long until *Blood of Conquest* breaks?"

> "She's holding on by sheer stubbornness, ma'am. Another ninety seconds of concentrated fire should do it."

> "Then let's not waste *Gallipoli*'s sacrifice. All batteries, target *Blood of Conquest*. Coordinate with *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*. I want that battleship dead."

The Federation battleships adjusted their firing solutions, their railguns tracking the wounded Ryzak vessel. All three ships fired simultaneously, tungsten-carbide rounds screaming across the void.

This time, the *Blood of Conquest* couldn't hold.

Her compromised armor failed, the penetrators carving through to critical systems. Her reactor spiked, the containment field destabilizing. Emergency systems tried to compensate, tried to contain the cascade, but it was too late.

The *Blood of Conquest* exploded, her reactor detonation tearing the ship apart from the inside out. The blast was smaller than *Gallipoli*'s death—more controlled, the containment field managing to direct some of the energy—but the result was the same. The battleship ceased to exist, replaced by an expanding sphere of debris and radiation.

> "Target destroyed," the weapons officer reported.

Reeves nodded slowly. Two Ryzak battleships dead, one compromised, one carrier crippled, four cruisers down to three. The Ryzak had lost their numerical advantage in capital ships.

But the fight was far from over. They still had overwhelming numbers in smaller vessels, and their remaining carrier was still launching interceptors. The battle had shifted, but it hadn't turned.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Reeves asked.

> "Six hours, fifty-six minutes, ma'am."

Nearly seven hours. They'd been fighting for less than an hour, and they had to hold for seven more.

Reeves looked at the tactical display, at the scattered icons representing Federation forces, at the red mass of Ryzak ships still pressing the attack.

*Gallipoli* had bought them time. Captain Harrison and his crew had held the line, had kept fighting until the ship came apart around them.

Now it was up to the rest of them to make sure that sacrifice meant something.

> "All ships, this is *Typhoon*. We've neutralized their battleship advantage. Now we grind them down. Focus fire on cruisers and screening elements. Keep their interceptors contained. And remember—we don't need to destroy them all. We just need to survive long enough for reinforcements to arrive."

She closed the channel and settled back into her command chair.

Six hours, fifty-six minutes.

They could do this.

They had to.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:52:14**

### Stalemate

The *Crimson Fang*—now under HARBINGER's control—had finished destroying the first carrier. The Ryzak vessel was a drifting hulk, atmosphere venting from dozens of breaches, half its launch bays demolished, fires burning in compartments exposed to vacuum. It was still technically intact, but it would never launch another fighter.

That left one carrier operational. And it was making all the difference.

Captain Reeves watched her tactical display with growing frustration. The fourth Ryzak battleship—*Wrath of Dominion*—had been taking sustained fire from all three Federation battleships for the past six minutes. By all rights, it should have been breaking apart by now, its shields failing, its armor compromised.

Instead, its shields were holding steady. Recovering, even.

> "Explain this to me," Reeves said, her voice tight. "We've got three battleships pouring fire into that target. Why isn't it dying?"

The tactical officer highlighted the power distribution overlay.

> "The second carrier, ma'am. It shifted all shield projection capability to the *Wrath of Dominion* once we destroyed *Blood of Conquest*. With only one battleship to support instead of two, the power transfer is more concentrated. They're feeding it faster than we can drain it."

Reeves pulled up the energy readings. The carrier—*Storm Bringer*—had moved into optimal support position, its shield generators running at maximum output, a steady beam of energy connecting it to the battleship. The *Wrath of Dominion* was still taking damage, but the math had changed. Where before the Federation's concentrated fire could overwhelm shield regeneration, now it could only match it.

And in a battle of attrition, time favored whoever could last longer.

> "What about the compromised battleship? Can HARBINGER redirect *Crimson Fang*'s fire to help us?"

> "Negative, ma'am. The boarding team reports that ship's shields are offline—they took too much damage in the engagement. She's got weapons, but no defensive capability. If we move her closer to engage, the Ryzak will tear her apart."

> "And *Lord Cardigan*?"

> "Still harassing the carrier, but her accuracy is too poor to break through shields. She's buying us time by forcing them to divert attention, but she can't deliver killing blows."

Reeves made the calculation. Three Federation battleships against one Ryzak battleship that was being actively sustained by a carrier. Their railguns could hurt it, but they couldn't kill it. Not quickly enough.

And the Ryzak fleet commander had just realized the same thing.

> "Ma'am, enemy fleet is repositioning," the sensor officer called out. "The three cruisers are... they're vectoring on us. Multiple destroyers forming up with them."

Reeves felt ice in her stomach.

The Ryzak had learned from their mistake with *Gallipoli*. They couldn't break through the Federation's capital ship firepower as long as all three battleships were operational. But if they could eliminate the most dangerous one, force it out of the fight—

The tactical assessment was already updating on her display, threat vectors converging on *Typhoon*'s position.

> "They're targeting us," she said quietly. "Three cruisers, five destroyers. Concentrated fire protocol."

Her XO, Commander James Morrison, moved to her side.

> "Ma'am, we're already at sixty-two percent shields from the sustained engagement. If they focus us the way they focused *Gallipoli*—"

> "I know." Reeves's jaw tightened. "Helm, evasive pattern epsilon. Weapons, split fire—keep pressure on the *Wrath of Dominion* but engage those cruisers as they close. And get me a damage control team standing by. We're about to take a beating."

The Ryzak formation was moving with coordinated precision now. The three cruisers—*Reaper's Edge*, *Blood Drinker*, and *Fang of War*—accelerated hard, splitting to attack from multiple vectors. Behind them, five destroyers matched their course, weapons charging, ready to add their lighter particle beams to the barrage.

They'd learned. They'd adapted. And now they were coming for blood.

---

The first wave of particle beams hit *Typhoon* from three directions simultaneously.

The battleship's shields flared brilliant white, already stressed from an hour of sustained combat. Reeves felt the ship shudder under her feet as the defensive fields struggled to dissipate the concentrated energy.

> "Shields at fifty-four percent," the tactical officer reported. "Multiple impacts, port and starboard quadrants."

> "Return fire. I want those cruisers suppressed."

*Typhoon*'s secondary batteries spoke, railgun rounds and missiles streaking toward the attacking cruisers. One salvo caught *Reaper's Edge* on her forward shields, forcing her to maneuver. Another forced *Blood Drinker* to adjust course. But they weren't breaking off—they were just being more careful, coordinating their approach.

The destroyers opened fire.

Lighter particle beams lanced across the void, adding to the barrage. They weren't as powerful as the cruisers' weapons, but there were five of them, and they were targeting specific sections of *Typhoon*'s shields, trying to create weak points.

> "Shields at forty-seven percent. Forward generators are running hot."

Another wave of fire from the cruisers. Then another. They were firing in sequence now, coordinated, never giving *Typhoon*'s shields time to recover. The pattern was deliberate, methodical, the same tactics they'd used to destroy *Gallipoli*.

Reeves watched her shield integrity dropping: 47%... 43%... 39%...

> "Engineering, reroute all available power to shields. Strip it from weapons if you have to."

> "Already doing it, ma'am. But we're taking damage faster than we can compensate."

*Fang of War* maneuvered into optimal position, its full broadside bearing on *Typhoon*'s weakened forward quarter. Six particle beams lanced out simultaneously, converging on the same stressed section of shield.

The forward shield generator failed.

> "Forward shields down!" the tactical officer shouted. "Rerouting through backup systems—"

A destroyer's particle beam punched through the gap before the backup could initialize. The beam carved into *Typhoon*'s armor, vaporizing plating, penetrating to the first internal bulkhead before the backup shield finally engaged.

> "Hull breach, section seven! Emergency containment in place. Forward sensor array is damaged—we've lost resolution on targets bearing zero-two-zero through zero-four-zero."

The ship shuddered as another concentrated barrage hammered home. The shields were holding, but barely. Reeves could see the power distribution readouts—they were redlining, pulling from every available system to feed the shield generators.

> "Shields at thirty-one percent, ma'am."

Twenty-nine percent.

Twenty-six percent.

> "Captain," Morrison said quietly. "If we stay here, they're going to tear us apart. We need to disengage."

Reeves looked at the tactical display. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* were still pouring fire into the *Wrath of Dominion*, but without *Typhoon* adding her guns, they weren't making progress. The Ryzak battleship's shields were holding, sustained by the carrier's power transfer.

But Morrison was right. If *Typhoon* stayed in the fight, she'd suffer the same fate as *Gallipoli*. And losing a second battleship would shift the balance too far.

> "Helm, break off. Set course for Jovian Shipyards, maximum velocity. Weapons, covering fire as we disengage—I want those cruisers focused on us, not on *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*."

> "Aye, ma'am."

*Typhoon* rotated, her main engines burning hard, accelerating away from the engagement zone. Her weapons continued firing as she withdrew, railguns and missiles keeping the Ryzak cruisers honest, forcing them to maintain defensive posture.

A parting shot from *Reaper's Edge* caught *Typhoon*'s aft shields, the defensive field flickering dangerously.

> "Shields at nineteen percent!"

> "Keep us moving. Engineering, damage assessment—what shape are we in?"

The chief engineer's voice came through, strained.

> "We've got hull breaches in three sections, forward sensor array is barely functional, two secondary batteries are offline, and our shield generators are on the edge of thermal failure. We need to get out of this fight, Captain. If we take one more concentrated barrage, we're done."

Reeves watched the tactical display as *Typhoon* pulled away, the distance to the Ryzak formation increasing. The cruisers were pursuing, but cautiously—they'd learned not to overextend. They were content to let *Typhoon* go, mission accomplished.

They'd forced the most powerful Federation battleship out of the fight.

> "ETA to Jovian Shipyards?"

> "Thirty-four minutes at current velocity, ma'am."

> "Get us there. And signal the yards—tell them we're coming in hot and we need emergency repairs. Priority items: shield generators, forward sensors, hull breaches, weapons systems. In that order."

She turned to Morrison.

> "You have the conn. Get us to the yards safely. I need to coordinate with *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*."

Morrison nodded, moving to the command chair. Reeves pulled up the fleet channel.

> "*Vanguard*, *Sentinel*, this is *Typhoon*. We're withdrawing for emergency repairs. You're the primary capital ships on station. HARBINGER, status of the compromised battleship?"

The AI's distinctive voice came through immediately.

> "Boarding team maintains control of *Crimson Fang*. Weapons are operational but shields are offline. Current position is defensible but vessel cannot maneuver aggressively without risk of destruction."

> "Understood. *Vanguard*, *Sentinel*—continue pressure on the *Wrath of Dominion*. Don't let that carrier sustain it unopposed. Corvettes, continue harassment operations against the screening elements. Talons, maintain fighter superiority and look for opportunities against the carrier."

A pause, then Captain Anderson's voice from *Vanguard*.

> "Acknowledged, *Typhoon*. We'll hold the line. You get those shields back online."

> "Count on it. *Typhoon* out."

Reeves looked at the tactical display one more time. The *Typhoon* was pulling away from the battle, her icon moving toward Jupiter. Behind her, *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* continued their duel with the *Wrath of Dominion*, railguns firing, taking return fire from the Ryzak cruisers and destroyers.

The Federation had lost *Gallipoli*. They'd lost twelve Talons. And now their most powerful battleship was out of action for at least the next hour.

The math was getting worse.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Reeves asked quietly.

> "Six hours, forty-eight minutes, ma'am."

Almost seven hours. And *Typhoon* would be at the yards for at least thirty to forty minutes of that, maybe longer depending on the damage.

Reeves settled into a secondary station, pulling up damage reports, coordinating with the engineering teams. The fight was continuing without them, and every minute *Typhoon* was out of action was a minute *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* had to hold alone.

She looked at the chronometer.

Six hours, forty-eight minutes.

They'd made it through the first hour. Six and a half more to go.

The Ryzak had demonstrated they could adapt, could learn, could force Federation capital ships out of the fight through concentrated fire. They'd leveled the playing field.

Now it was a question of whether the Federation could hold long enough for Third North Fleet to arrive.

And whether there would be anything left to save when they did.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:42:31**

### Attrition

The Federation Talons were dying.

Not in dramatic explosions or sudden catastrophic failures. They were dying slowly, worn down by an enemy that refused to quit. The Ryzak interceptors kept coming, wave after wave, launching from the carrier's remaining functional bays. The Federation pilots were better trained, better equipped, and better coordinated—but they were outnumbered, and in a fight of attrition, numbers eventually won.

Lieutenant Sarah Chen—callsign "Reaper"—rolled her Talon into a hard break, a Ryzak interceptor screaming past her canopy close enough to see the alien pilot inside. Her weapons had been depleted fifteen minutes ago. She was flying on fumes, using her superior maneuverability to stay alive, to draw fire, to keep the enemy off her squadron mates who still had ammunition.

> "Reaper-Three, you're clear. Bandit on your six is splashed."

> "Copy, Lead. I'm winchester. Plasma lances depleted, missiles gone. RTB for resupply."

> "Acknowledged. Jump to Jovian Shipyards, get rearmed, get back here. Clock's ticking."

Reaper-Three broke from the engagement, his Talon's jump drive spooling up. Space twisted around the craft, and it vanished—a two-minute round trip to the shipyards and back, but he'd need at least ten to fifteen minutes on the ground for rearm and refuel before he could return to the fight.

Chen checked her tactical display. Of the original forty-eight Federation Talons that had started the engagement, twenty-seven were still in the battle space. Another eight were at Jovian Shipyards going through frantic resupply operations, crews working at emergency speed to reload weapons and patch damage. Thirteen had been destroyed outright, their pilots either dead or recovered by search and rescue craft.

The rotation system was keeping them alive, barely. Talons could jump out, rearm in the shipyards, and jump back in under two minutes of travel time. But the shipyard crews could only work so fast, and every Talon that jumped out for resupply was one less fighter in the engagement space.

And the Ryzak interceptors kept coming.

> "All Talon elements, this is Reaper Lead. We're rotating through resupply but we can't keep pace. They're launching faster than we can reload. I'm seeing ammunition depletion across multiple squadrons."

The response from *Vanguard*'s tactical coordinator was immediate, and grim.

> "Acknowledged, Reaper Lead. We're reading the same. Stand by."

Chen watched another Talon—Falcon-Four—break away from the furball, engines burning hard as his jump drive engaged. The pilot's voice came through, exhausted.

> "Falcon-Four jumping to yards. Third resupply run. I'll be back in fifteen."

> "Copy, Falcon-Four. Good hunting."

But the math was brutal. Even with the rotation system, even with the shipyard crews working around the clock, the Federation couldn't sustain this tempo. For every Talon that jumped out to rearm, the Ryzak gained local superiority for those critical minutes.

Chen's threat receiver screamed. She yanked the stick hard, rolling into evasive maneuvers, feeling the g-forces compress her into the seat. A Ryzak interceptor flashed past, its weapons tracking but missing by meters.

Her weapons display showed empty. She'd been flying for twelve minutes without ordnance, pure evasion, drawing fire and providing targeting data for her wingmen. It was time to rotate out.

> "Reaper Lead is winchester. Jumping to yards for resupply. Reaper-Two, you have the squadron."

> "Copy, Lead. We'll hold."

Chen selected the jump coordinates, felt the drive engage, and watched space twist around her canopy. The engagement zone vanished, replaced by the structured chaos of Jovian Shipyards, where ground crews were already waving her toward a loading bay.

Two minutes total jump time. Fifteen minutes for resupply and systems check. Then back into the meat grinder.

> "All Talons, this is Station Command. We need help. Reinforcements are inbound."

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:38:17**

### The Call

Commander Sarah Chen stood in Galileo Station's operations center, staring at the tactical display. The numbers were stark and getting worse by the minute.

Federation Talons: 27 in engagement space, 8 rotating through resupply, 13 destroyed. Total combat effectiveness down 47% from initial strength.

Ryzak interceptors: Still launching from the carrier, estimates putting active craft at 80+.

The rotation system through Jovian Shipyards was buying time, but it wasn't sustainable. The Federation couldn't maintain fighter superiority against these odds, not with the resupply bottleneck. And if they lost the fighter engagement, the Ryzak interceptors would start hitting *Vanguard*, *Sentinel*, and the corvettes.

They'd held for nearly an hour. They'd bloodied the Ryzak fleet badly. But they were running out of options.

Chen pulled up the communication protocols.

> "HARBINGER, are you monitoring?"

The AI's geometric form materialized on her screen immediately.

> "Affirmative, Commander Chen. I am tracking the fighter engagement degradation. Current resupply rotation rate is insufficient to maintain combat strength."

> "We need reinforcements. What's the status of Earth's Talon squadrons?"

> "All Earth-based squadrons have been on standby since the engagement began. Portugal: twenty-five aircraft. United States: twenty aircraft. Japan: sixteen aircraft. All pilots are in their craft, all systems are hot, and they are prepared for immediate deployment."

Chen took a breath. The Earth pilots had been briefed twelve hours ago, when HARBINGER appeared on every screen and told them aliens were coming. They knew what was at stake. They knew what they'd face.

Now it was time to prove they were ready.

> "Authorization code Chen-Alpha-Seven. Deploy all Earth Talon squadrons immediately. Transmit jump coordinates for engagement zone."

> "Understood, Commander. Transmitting now."

Chen watched the communication status update. Encrypted signals, using quantum-paired channels, transmitted simultaneously to Monte Real Air Base in Portugal, Groom Lake in Nevada, Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, and Hyakuri Air Base in Japan.

The message was simple:

**PRIORITY ALPHA. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. ALL TALON SQUADRONS SCRAMBLE IMMEDIATELY. COORDINATES TRANSMITTED. COMBAT DEPLOYMENT. ENGAGE ON ARRIVAL.**

On Earth, thousands of kilometers below, pilots were already moving. They'd been sitting in their cockpits for hours, waiting for this moment. Ground crews were pulling chocks. Engines were lighting up.

And in less than five minutes, Earth's defenders would join the fight.

> "HARBINGER, coordinate the deployment. Get them formed up above the atmosphere and jump them directly into the engagement zone."

> "Acknowledged, Commander. Coordinating now."

Chen looked at the tactical display one more time. Twenty-seven Federation Talons in the engagement space, trying to hold against eighty Ryzak interceptors.

Help was coming.

It just had to arrive in time.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:34:52**

### Scramble

At Monte Real Air Base, Lieutenant Miguel Freitas was already in his Talon's cockpit, had been for hours, monitoring the tactical feed from the battle above. He'd watched *Gallipoli* die. He'd watched *Typhoon* withdraw. He'd watched the Federation Talons fight and die against impossible odds.

Twelve hours ago, HARBINGER had appeared on every screen in the briefing room and told them the truth. Aliens were real. Aliens were coming. And Earth was going to war.

Miguel had known HARBINGER for three years—or known *of* the AI, at least. When the Talons first arrived in Portugal, HARBINGER had been the voice explaining the technology, walking pilots through the capabilities, teaching them how to fight in vacuum. The AI's presence had been constant but distant, a teacher more than a companion.

Now that voice was about to send them into combat.

The alert tone cut through his headset.

**PRIORITY ALPHA. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. ALL TALON SQUADRONS SCRAMBLE IMMEDIATELY.**

Miguel's hands moved on pure training, muscle memory from hundreds of sorties taking over. Throttles forward, systems check, weapons armed—

> "All Portuguese Talons, this is Tower. You are cleared for immediate takeoff. Vector three-five-zero, climb to orbital insertion altitude. Execute."

The Talon's engines screamed to life, the fusion drive spooling up with a sound that Miguel felt in his chest. Around him, twenty-four other Talons were doing the same, the entire squadron lighting up simultaneously.

> "Strike Package Delta, this is Delta Lead. Form on me. We're going up."

Miguel released the brake and the Talon leaped forward, acceleration pressing him back into his seat. The runway blurred beneath him, then fell away as the aircraft clawed for altitude. Beside him, Captain Teresa Ramos's Talon matched his climb.

The sky above was clear, brilliant blue fading to the black of space as they climbed. Miguel's altimeter spun upward—ten thousand meters, twenty thousand, thirty thousand. The air was thinning, but the fusion drive pushed harder.

Fifty thousand meters. The curvature of Earth was visible now, Portugal's coastline spreading out beneath him. Seventy thousand meters. One hundred thousand.

The sky was black. Stars were visible, steady and unblinking. His aircraft's systems transitioned smoothly from atmospheric flight to vacuum operations.

Miguel Freitas was in space.

And he wasn't alone.

---

At Groom Lake, Major Ellie Morse led the American squadron into the climb, twenty Talons rising from the Nevada desert. The transition to vacuum was smooth, practiced, exactly as briefed.

> "All US Talons, this is Viper Lead. Form up at rally point alpha. We've got friends joining us."

At Kadena, eight operational Talons screamed off the runway, climbing hard toward orbit. Major Morse checked her tactical display, watching as icons began appearing—Portuguese craft climbing out of Europe, Japanese fighters rising from Hyakuri.

At Hyakuri Air Base, Major Tanaka Utsuho—"Okuu"—pushed her throttle to maximum, feeling the Talon respond. Beside her, fifteen other Japanese pilots climbed in formation.

> "JASDF Talons, this is Raven Lead. Vector two-eight-five, climb to one hundred twenty thousand meters. Link up with allied forces."

Okuu watched her altimeter climb. She'd been briefed twelve hours ago about what was coming. She'd had time to process it, to accept it, to prepare herself mentally for what she was about to face.

Her hands were steady on the controls.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:28:11**

### Formation

At one hundred and twenty thousand meters above Earth's surface, sixty-one Talons from four nations formed up in a loose sphere. Most of the pilots had never met, had never flown together, but they'd all received the same briefing twelve hours ago. They knew what they were facing. They knew the stakes.

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas's tactical display showed them all—blue icons scattered across his screen, each one representing a pilot from a different nation. Strangers, yes, but united by a common purpose.

They were Earth's defenders.

HARBINGER's voice cut through the tactical net, deep and familiar.

> "All Earth Talon squadrons, this is HARBINGER. Jump coordinates are locked into your navigation systems. You will emerge directly into the engagement zone, approximately fifteen thousand meters from the primary furball."

Miguel had heard this voice countless times during training. But hearing it now, knowing what waited at the other end of that jump, was different.

> "Ryzak interceptors will be immediately hostile. Engage on sight. Maintain formation discipline. Federation forces are with you. I am with you. And Earth is watching."

Miguel checked his weapons display. Full loadout. Plasma lances charged. Missiles armed. Shields at one hundred percent.

> "Warp drives active."

Everything became a luminous tunnel as the Talons jumped forward bending space ahead of them. And then, they were there.

Jupiter filled Miguel's canopy, massive and brilliant. The engagement zone was ahead, marked by weapons fire, by explosions, by scattered debris.

And everywhere, red icons. Ryzak interceptors, dozens of them, turning to face the new arrivals.

HARBINGER's voice cut through the tactical net, calm and precise.

> "All Earth Talons, you have arrived. Weapons free. Engage at will."

Miguel armed his weapons, selected his first target, and pushed his throttle forward.

Twenty-five Portuguese Talons followed him.

Twenty American Talons dove from above, Major Morse's voice cutting through the net: "Viper Squadron, engage!"

Sixteen Japanese Talons rolled into attack formation, Major Tanaka's crisp acknowledgment: "Hell Ravens, moving to intercept!"

Sixty-one fresh Talons, full weapons loadout, pilots ready for their first kills.

The Ryzak were about to learn that Earth had arrived.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:25:13**

### First Blood

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas's targeting system locked on a Ryzak interceptor at eight thousand meters, the alien craft's angular frame highlighted in red on his HUD. The fighter was turning toward him, weapons charging, but Miguel was faster.

He squeezed the trigger.

The plasma lance shot out, a brilliant line of superheated matter crossing the distance in a heartbeat. The Ryzak's shields flared white, then failed. The lance punched through the cockpit section, coring the craft. It tumbled away, already breaking apart.

Miguel's first kill. An alien fighter, in space, defending Earth.

He didn't have time to process it.

> "Delta-Two, splash one. Engaging new target."

Captain Ramos's voice came through, tight with focus.

> "Delta Lead, confirm kill. Good shooting. Delta Flight, stay tight, don't get separated."

The Portuguese squadron drove into the Ryzak formation like a spear, plasma lances firing, missiles launching. Around them, the American and Japanese squadrons were doing the same, each element hitting from a different vector.

The effect was immediate and devastating.

The Ryzak interceptors had been pressing hard against the depleted Federation Talons, maintaining numerical superiority through sheer volume. But they'd been fighting for nearly ninety minutes, their pilots were fatigued, their weapons were depleted, and their formation was loose.

Sixty-one fresh fighters, coordinated and aggressive, hit them like a sledgehammer.

Major Ellie Morse rolled her Talon onto a target, fired, watched it die, and immediately acquired another. Her wingman splashed two more in quick succession. The American squadron was moving through the Ryzak formation like sharks through a school of fish.

> "Viper-Three, splash three and four. These guys are slow—they can't track us."

> "Stay focused," Morse replied. "Don't get cocky. There are still a lot of them."

She was right. Despite the sudden reversal, despite the losses, the Ryzak had numbers. For every interceptor the Earth pilots destroyed, there seemed to be two more behind it. The carrier was still launching, still feeding craft into the engagement zone.

But the momentum had shifted.

Major Tanaka Utsuho—"Okuu"—led her Japanese squadron in a slashing attack through the Ryzak right flank. Her element destroyed five interceptors in thirty seconds, plasma lances and missiles working in perfect coordination.

> "Hell Ravens, reform on me. Don't chase—stay disciplined. Let them come to us."

The doctrine was working. The Earth pilots had trained for this, drilled the tactics until they were instinctive. Stay in formation, support your wingman, engage decisively and break off before the enemy could respond.

The Ryzak were trying to adapt, trying to counter, but they were fighting on fumes against fresh pilots in superior aircraft.

---

Aboard Galileo Station, Commander Sarah Chen watched the tactical display with grim satisfaction. The arrival of Earth's squadrons had changed everything. The Ryzak interceptor advantage was evaporating, their numbers dropping rapidly as the coordinated Earth attack tore through them.

> "Federation Talon elements, this is Station Command. Earth forces are engaged and holding. All Federation squadrons are cleared to rotate through Jovian Shipyards for emergency resupply. Execute immediately."

The response was immediate. The exhausted Federation pilots, many flying on empty weapons bays and damaged systems, began breaking off from the engagement. Their jump drives spooled up, and they vanished in ripples of twisted space, heading for the shipyards.

For the first time in nearly two hours, they had breathing room.

Chen pulled up the fleet status summary, her expression darkening as she reviewed the numbers.

Federation Talons: 27 operational but depleted, rotating to resupply. 13 destroyed.

Earth Talons: 61 engaged, fresh weapons and systems.

Total allied fighters: 88 operational.

Ryzak interceptors: Estimated 70-80 still in engagement zone, with carrier continuing to launch.

The math was still brutal. Even with Earth's reinforcements, they were outnumbered. The Ryzak had more fighters in the battle space, and their carrier could keep launching for hours yet.

This wasn't a victory. It was a reprieve.

> "HARBINGER, analysis. Can we hold with current force composition?"

The AI's geometric form appeared on her screen, pulsing thoughtfully.

> "Current engagement projections show Earth forces maintaining local superiority for approximately forty-seven minutes, accounting for ammunition expenditure and pilot fatigue. However, Ryzak carrier launch tempo has not decreased. They are replacing losses faster than we can inflict them."

> "So we're still losing the attrition battle."

> "Correct. The arrival of Earth forces has stabilized the situation temporarily, but the fundamental mathematics remain unfavorable. We have approximately eighty-eight fighters against seventy-plus interceptors, with the Ryzak able to launch an additional fifty to sixty craft before their carrier's magazine is depleted."

Chen looked at the tactical display, watching the swirling dogfight play out. Blue icons and red icons, merging and separating, each exchange leaving fewer fighters in the battle space.

> "What about the capital ship engagement?"

> "*Vanguard* and *Sentinel* continue to engage the *Wrath of Dominion*, but the carrier's shield projection is sustaining the battleship. *Typhoon* is at Jovian Shipyards undergoing emergency repairs, ETA to return to combat is forty-three minutes. *Lord Cardigan* continues harassment of the carrier but is taking accumulated damage."

> "How much longer can *Cardigan* hold?"

HARBINGER's geometric form flickered.

> "Unknown. Her shields are compromised, her jury-rigged systems are failing. The Ryzak screening elements are beginning to focus fire on her. Estimate she will be forced to disengage within the next ten to fifteen minutes."

Chen's jaw tightened. They'd held for two hours. They had nearly five more to go before Third North Fleet arrived. And the Ryzak were grinding them down, ship by ship, fighter by fighter.

> "Keep me updated. And HARBINGER—coordinate with the Earth squadrons. Make sure they understand they're not invincible. Those pilots are green, and they're going to make mistakes."

> "Acknowledged, Commander."

Chen turned back to the tactical display, watching the battle unfold. The Earth pilots were performing better than anyone had expected, better than they had any right to given that this was their first real combat.

But "better than expected" wasn't the same as "good enough to win."

And the clock kept ticking.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:19:37**

### Accumulation

The battleship *Lord Cardigan* had been fighting for two hours straight with jury-rigged civilian shields and gunners using manual targeting. She'd harassed the Ryzak carrier, forced it to maneuver, destroyed two destroyers through sheer luck and volume of fire.

But her luck was running out.

Captain William Shaw stood on his bridge, watching the shield integrity readouts drop with each passing minute. The civilian generators they'd installed at Jovian Shipyards were never designed for sustained combat. The emergency bypass connections were failing one by one, the jury-rigged power conduits overheating.

> "Shields at thirty-eight percent," the tactical officer reported. "Port generator is offline. Starboard generator is running at one hundred forty percent rated capacity and climbing."

> "Reroute power from non-essential systems," Shaw ordered. "Life support, secondary lighting, crew quarters—strip it all. Feed those shields."

> "Aye, sir."

The *Cardigan* shuddered as another volley of particle beams struck her shields. The Ryzak screening elements—two cruisers and four destroyers—had finally decided she was enough of an annoyance to warrant concentrated attention. They were coordinating their fire now, methodically wearing down her defenses.

> "Shields at thirty-one percent. Starboard generator temperature is redlining. Engineering reports imminent failure."

Shaw looked at the tactical display. The carrier—*Storm Bringer*—was maintaining its shield projection to the *Wrath of Dominion*, keeping the Ryzak battleship alive despite concentrated fire from *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*. *Lord Cardigan* had been harassing it for nearly two hours, forcing it to divide its attention, preventing it from focusing entirely on shield projection.

But they'd done all they could do. The math was clear.

> "Helm, set course for Jovian Shipyards. Maximum velocity. Weapons, continuous fire until we're out of range. Let's make them remember us."

> "Aye, sir."

The *Lord Cardigan* began to turn, her massive bulk rotating ponderously, her engines preparing to burn hard. Her railgun batteries continued firing even as she maneuvered, rounds screaming toward the carrier and its escorts with wild, unpredictable trajectories.

One shot actually connected with a destroyer's shields, the impact stressing the defensive field. Another missed by three hundred meters. A third somehow clipped the carrier's aft quarter, the round skipping off shields at an angle.

Pure luck, every single one. But it was making the Ryzak nervous.

> "Engineering to bridge. Starboard shield generator just failed. Complete thermal burnout. We're down to backup systems only."

> "Acknowledged. How long until we can jump?"

> "Drive is spooling up now. Thirty seconds."

The Ryzak cruisers intensified their fire, sensing the Federation battleship was trying to escape. Particle beams lanced across the void, hammering into *Cardigan*'s failing shields. The backup generators were struggling, flickering, barely holding.

> "Shields at eighteen percent. Backup generators are overloading."

Shaw watched the jump drive status: twenty seconds. Fifteen. Ten.

A concentrated barrage from both cruisers struck simultaneously. The shields flared, held for half a second, then collapsed entirely.

The follow-up shots punched through bare armor.

Plating buckled. Bulkheads ruptured. The hits weren't deep penetrations—*Cardigan* was too tough for that—but they were carving channels through her outer hull, destroying weapons mounts, sensor arrays, point defense turrets.

> "Hull breaches, sections nine, twelve, and fifteen. Emergency containment holding. We've lost two secondary batteries."

The jump drive indicator turned green.

> "Helm, execute jump. Now."

Space twisted around the *Lord Cardigan*, and she vanished, leaving the engagement zone in a ripple of distorted space-time. The Ryzak cruisers continued firing for three seconds at empty space before their targeting systems recognized the Federation battleship was gone.

Shaw allowed himself a moment to breathe.

> "Damage report."

> "Hull breaches in three sections, shields completely offline, starboard generator is slag, port generator is barely functional. Two secondary batteries destroyed, point defense coverage reduced by forty percent. We're alive, sir, but we're not combat effective."

> "Get us to the shipyards. Emergency docking procedures. Tell them we need shield generators, armor patches, and weapons replacements. And tell them we'll be back."

Shaw looked at his communications officer.

> "Open a channel. All frequencies. Let's give everyone something to remember us by."

> "Channel open, sir."

Shaw nodded to the systems operator, who'd been waiting for this order since they'd started the engagement. The operator's hands moved across the console, pulling up a file that had been loaded into the ship's systems before they'd even left Jovian Shipyards.

The opening notes of Iron Maiden's *The Trooper* began to play over the comm links—loud, defiant, unmistakably human.

Shaw's voice cut through the music, carrying across every tactical channel in the engagement zone.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is *Lord Cardigan*. We're withdrawing for repairs, but we're not done yet. Keep fighting. Keep shooting. And remember—we're defending Earth. They picked the wrong planet."

The music swelled, Eddie's distinctive guitar riff cutting through the chaos of battle.

*You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too*
*You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through*

Throughout the engagement zone, pilots heard it. Federation crews heard it. Earth's fresh squadrons heard it. Even the Ryzak, monitoring human communications, heard the strange, aggressive sounds of an alien music form.

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas heard it as he rolled onto another target, and despite the fear, despite the exhaustion, despite everything, he smiled.

Major Ellie Morse heard it and pushed her throttle forward harder, diving into the furball with renewed aggression.

Major Tanaka heard it and keyed her squadron channel.

> "Hell Ravens, you heard the battleship. They bought us time. Let's make it count."

Aboard *Vanguard*, Captain Anderson heard it and allowed himself a brief smile before returning his attention to the *Wrath of Dominion*.

And aboard Galileo Station, Commander Sarah Chen heard it and felt something that might have been hope, or might have been defiance, or might have been the simple human refusal to quit even when the odds were impossible.

*The Trooper* continued to play as *Lord Cardigan* warped toward the shipyards, her hull scarred, her shields down, but her guns silent only because she'd run out of targets in range.

The Ryzak had forced another Federation battleship out of the fight.

But that battleship had left on her own terms, with music playing and her guns still hot.

And somehow, that mattered.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:12:44**

### Charge of the Light Brigade

The *Lord Cardigan* materialized at Jovian Shipyards in a shimmer of twisted space, her scarred hull trailing frozen atmosphere from three separate breaches. Emergency crews were already moving toward her docking position before the ship had finished decelerating.

Captain Shaw stood on his bridge, watching the damage control reports scroll across his displays. Hull breaches in three sections. Shields completely offline. Two secondary batteries destroyed. Point defense coverage reduced by forty percent.

She was a wreck. But her engines still worked. Her jump drive still functioned. And her main railgun batteries, despite everything, were still operational.

Shaw keyed the ship-wide comm.

> "All hands, this is the Captain. Disembark. That's an order. Engineering, damage control, gunnery crews—everyone. You have five minutes to get to the airlocks. Move."

There was a moment of stunned silence across the ship.

> "Sir?" his XO, Commander Patricia Hayes, said quietly. "What are you—"

> "You heard the order, Commander. Get the crew off this ship. Now."

Hayes looked at him, her expression shifting from confusion to understanding to something that might have been horror.

> "Is he going to...?" the tactical officer muttered to the sensor operator.

> "Yeah," the sensor operator replied, already moving toward the exit. "He's going to."

Hayes didn't move. She stood there, staring at Shaw.

> "Sir, you can't—"

> "Commander, I'm not asking. I'm ordering. Get the crew to safety. They've earned it."

> "And you?"

Shaw turned to face her, his expression calm.

> "*Lord Cardigan* has one more trip in her. And I'm going to make sure she gets there."

Hayes opened her mouth to argue, then closed it. She'd served with Shaw for three years. She knew that tone. Knew that look. There was no arguing with him now.

> "It's been an honor, sir."

> "The honor's been mine, Commander. Now get off my ship. You have four minutes."

Hayes saluted, then turned and ran for the exit. Around the bridge, the remaining crew were already moving, heading for the airlocks. Shaw watched them go, then turned back to his displays.

The evacuation took three minutes and forty-two seconds. Shaw watched the personnel indicators drop to zero on every section of the ship except the bridge. The airlocks sealed. The docking clamps released. Emergency crews at the shipyards were already pulling back, sensing something was about to happen.

Shaw moved to the helm station and sat down, his hands settling on the controls. The interface was simple enough—he'd piloted smaller craft before, back when he was a lieutenant. A battleship wasn't that different. Just bigger. Much bigger.

He pulled up the navigation computer, plotting a course back to the engagement zone. The system calculated the jump coordinates automatically, displaying the destination on his tactical overlay.

Then he adjusted the terminus point.

The navigation computer immediately flashed a warning in angry red text:

**WARNING: WARP TERMINUS INSIDE SOLID OBJECT**
**COLLISION PROBABILITY: 100%**
**RECOMMEND COURSE ADJUSTMENT**

Shaw stared at the warning for a moment, then reached out and overrode it. The system protested with another warning, then another. He overrode them all, manually confirming each safety interlock, each emergency protocol.

The terminus point locked in. The crippled Ryzak carrier—the one that *Crimson Fang* had torn apart earlier in the engagement. The vessel was still technically intact, still venting atmosphere, still burning in compartments exposed to vacuum. Its shields were down. Its crew was evacuating.

And *Lord Cardigan* was going to jump directly into its midsection.

Shaw pulled up the communications console, setting it to broadcast on all Federation channels.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is Captain William Shaw, *Lord Cardigan*. To the crew who served with me—you made this ship proud. To everyone still fighting out there—hold the line. Earth is counting on you."

He paused, his hands steady on the controls.

> "*Lord Cardigan*, out."

He closed the channel and activated the jump drive. The battleship's massive engines began to spool up, power building in the drive coils, space-time beginning to bend around the ship's hull.

Shaw thought of his crew, safely evacuated at Jovian Shipyards. Of Commander Hayes, who'd served with distinction and deserved to survive this war. Of the Earth he'd never see again, but would defend with his last breath.

The warp drive reached full charge, and the *Lord Cardigan* launched forward in a tunnel of compressed space.

---

The carrier *Worldbreaker* hung in the void, crippled and burning. Half its launch bays were torn open, venting atmosphere in crystalline plumes that caught Jupiter's distant light. Fires burned in compartments exposed to vacuum, fed by oxygen still leaking from ruptured life support conduits. The vessel's spine was compromised, structural members visible through gaps in the hull plating where *Crimson Fang*'s weapons had carved deep wounds.

Ryzak crew were evacuating in a steady stream, escape pods launching every few seconds, small bright points of thrust vectoring away from the dying ship. The carrier's reactor was still stable, but the damage was catastrophic. The vessel would never fight again.

Then space twisted.

It began as a ripple, a distortion in the fabric of reality itself, appearing sixty meters inside the carrier's hull. The warp tunnel was opening, space-time folding to accommodate the incoming vessel, and the terminus point was locked precisely where Captain Shaw had set it—in the carrier's midsection, deep within the superstructure, surrounded by bulkheads and compartments and the skeletal framework that held the massive ship together.

The *Lord Cardigan* emerged.

Time seemed to slow, each microsecond stretching into subjective eternity as fifteen hundred meters of Federation battleship materialized inside Ryzak architecture.

The bow appeared first, the reinforced prow designed to deflect micrometeorites and debris at high velocity. It emerged moving at relativistic speeds—the residual velocity imparted by the warp transition, a fraction of lightspeed translated into conventional space. The prow materialized occupying the same physical coordinates as a Ryzak bulkhead, and physics made its preference clear.

The bulkhead ceased to exist.

Not shattered, not torn apart—simply *ceased*. The molecular bonds holding the Ryzak alloy together encountered an object attempting to occupy the same space, and the fundamental forces of reality rejected that impossibility. The matter didn't have time to compress, didn't have time to shear. It just stopped being in that location, its atoms scattered at the quantum level, disrupted beyond any possibility of cohesion.

The battleship continued forward, momentum carrying it deeper into the carrier's hull.

More bulkheads vanished. Compartments full of equipment, ammunition, supplies—all of it encountering the impossible intrusion of a capital ship materializing inside them. Structural members that could support thousands of tons of force simply disappeared where the *Lord Cardigan*'s mass overlapped them. The carrier's internal architecture was being erased, frame by frame, as the battleship carved through it.

But the *Lord Cardigan* was dying too.

Her bow crumpled, the reinforced plating designed to withstand weapons fire encountering forces it was never built to handle. The forward sections compressed like an accordion, each meter of penetration costing the battleship her own structure. Armor plating buckled inward, then failed. The forward torpedo tubes collapsed, their magazines detonating in sympathetic explosions that added to the catastrophic damage.

Deeper still, the battleship plowed into the carrier's engineering section.

The Ryzak power conduits, thick cables carrying energy from the reactor to the ship's systems, were sheared through. Raw power arced across the severed connections, brilliant white-hot plasma leaping between contacts before the automatic cutoffs could engage. Fuel lines ruptured, spraying volatile chemicals that ignited instantly in the presence of the electrical discharge.

The carrier's spine—the central structural member running the length of the vessel—encountered the *Lord Cardigan*'s forward superstructure. Both were designed to be the strongest parts of their respective ships. Both were built to withstand forces that would tear lesser structures apart.

Neither survived the impact.

The spine shattered, stress fractures racing along its length in both directions, branching like lightning through metal. The carrier's structural integrity failed catastrophically, the framework that distributed force across the hull giving way in sections. The forward third of the ship began to separate, the connection points failing one by one, bulkheads tearing free, compartments venting.

But the *Lord Cardigan* was breaking too.

Her forward sections were gone, crushed and scattered. The bridge where Captain Shaw sat—where he had sat—was compressed into a space too small to contain it, every system failing simultaneously, every surface collapsing inward. The middle sections were crumpling, each frame buckling as it encountered resistance, the battleship's own momentum working against her structural members.

And then the reactor containment failed.

The *Lord Cardigan*'s fusion core, already damaged from the earlier engagement, already stressed by the carrier's weapons fire, now faced forces it could never have been designed to withstand. The magnetic containment field, the invisible cage that held a miniature star in check, flickered and died.

The fusion reaction, no longer constrained, expanded.

It happened in nanoseconds, but in the stretched subjective time of the catastrophe, each stage was distinct. The plasma—hydrogen heated to millions of degrees, compressed to the point where nuclei fused—expanded outward in a sphere. It encountered the reactor housing first, the reinforced walls designed to contain exactly this scenario. They held for a fraction of a second, directing the expanding plasma down the emergency venting channels.

But this wasn't a controlled shutdown. This was total containment failure.

The plasma burned through the reactor housing in microseconds. It carved through the surrounding compartments, through crew quarters that were empty, through weapons magazines that weren't. The first magazine detonation added conventional explosives to the expanding fireball. Then another. Then a dozen more, the *Lord Cardigan*'s remaining ammunition cooking off in a cascading sequence of secondary explosions.

The battleship came apart from the inside.

The expanding plasma found the carrier's reactor next. The Ryzak containment system, still functional despite the catastrophic damage, detected the incoming energy wave and attempted an emergency shutdown. Magnetic fields intensified, trying to maintain cohesion, trying to prevent exactly what was about to happen.

It wasn't enough.

The wave of superheated plasma from the *Lord Cardigan*'s reactor struck the carrier's containment field and overwhelmed it. The Ryzak reactor's magnetic cage collapsed, and a second fusion reaction lost containment. Two miniature stars, now unconstrained, merged into a single expanding sphere of plasma hotter than the surface of Earth's sun.

The combined detonation propagated outward in all directions simultaneously.

Through the carrier's remaining structure, finding fuel reserves and ammunition stores, each new source of combustible material adding to the growing fireball. Through the *Lord Cardigan*'s aft sections, the battleship's stern separating from what remained of the forward hull, tumbling away even as it vaporized. Through the debris field already surrounding both ships, smaller fragments flash-heating to incandescence before sublimating into plasma themselves.

The light was brilliant beyond description. Every wavelength from radio to gamma, the full electromagnetic spectrum released in a single pulse that traveled outward at the speed of light. The visible component—the light that human and Ryzak eyes could detect—was a brief, terrible white that outshone Jupiter itself for three full seconds.

From Galileo Station, seventy kilometers away, every external sensor automatically filtered the brightness, preventing the blast from saturating the detectors. The flash appeared as a new star in the tactical display, so bright it cast shadows in the operations center despite the distance.

From the engagement zone, every pilot saw it. Federation Talons, Earth squadrons, Ryzak interceptors—all of them registered the detonation on their sensors, the massive energy spike that temporarily overwhelmed their detection systems.

And then, as quickly as it had appeared, the light began to fade.

The expanding plasma sphere cooled as it grew, radiating energy into the void, its temperature dropping from millions of degrees to thousands to hundreds. The brilliant white faded to orange, then red, then infrared invisible to the naked eye.

When the sensors cleared and could resolve the space where the carrier had been, there was nothing.

No carrier. No battleship. No debris larger than a few meters across. Just an expanding sphere of vaporized metal and superheated gas, spreading out into the black, cooling and dissipating, joining the countless other particles drifting through the void.

The *Lord Cardigan* and the Ryzak carrier *Worldbreaker* had ceased to exist, their matter scattered across thousands of cubic kilometers, their structures reduced to their component atoms.

And in the silence that followed, as sensors recalibrated and tactical displays updated, as the brilliant afterimage faded from human and alien retinas alike, one fact became clear to everyone who had witnessed it:

Captain William Shaw had taken his broken battleship and ended the war's largest remaining Ryzak carrier in the single most destructive close-range engagement in the battle's history.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:07:19**

### The Wrath Endures

Aboard *Vanguard*, Captain Anderson watched the tactical display update as the brilliant flash faded from his sensors. The carrier icon blinked out, replaced by a debris field marker. One Ryzak carrier eliminated. Only one remained operational.

> "*Lord Cardigan* confirmed destroyed," the sensor operator reported, his voice subdued. "Both vessels completely vaporized. No survivors."

> "Tactical assessment," Anderson said quietly. "How does this change the engagement?"

The tactical officer pulled up the revised fleet composition.

> "The remaining Ryzak carrier—*Storm Bringer*—can no longer maintain shield projection to their battleship and full launch tempo simultaneously. They'll have to choose between sustaining the *Wrath of Dominion* or continuing to deploy interceptors."

> "And which are they choosing?"

> "Neither yet, sir. They're... reconfiguring. Pulling back screening elements, tightening formation."

Anderson studied the display. The Ryzak fleet was adjusting, the remaining carrier repositioning, the battleship *Wrath of Dominion* maintaining its defensive stance while cruisers and destroyers formed a tighter screen.

They were adapting again. Learning.

> "How long until *Typhoon* returns?"

> "Thirty-eight minutes, sir. Jovian Shipyards reports they're rushing the repairs, but she won't be at full capability."

Thirty-eight minutes. Anderson looked at his own ship's status. *Vanguard* had been in continuous combat for over two hours. Shields were at forty-seven percent and slowly regenerating. Three secondary batteries were offline. Point defense coverage was degraded. The destroyer *Sentinel* was in similar condition, her jury-rigged Kryllian drive performing adequately but her overall combat effectiveness reduced.

Two Federation battleships against one Ryzak battleship being sustained by a carrier.

The math should have favored the Federation. Should have.

But the stalemate had held for nearly forty minutes now, both sides pouring fire into each other, neither able to achieve a decisive advantage. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* couldn't break through the shield projection fast enough, and the *Wrath of Dominion* couldn't maneuver aggressively enough to force either Federation ship out of the fight.

> "Sir, new contact," the sensor operator called out. "Multiple launches from *Storm Bringer*. Not interceptors—these are bigger. Reading them as bomber-class craft."

Anderson felt ice settle in his stomach.

> "How many?"

> "Twelve. They're forming up behind the screening elements. Torpedo profiles, heavy munitions loadout."

Bombers. Capital ship killers. The Ryzak had been holding them in reserve, and now they were deploying them.

> "Time to intercept range?"

> "Four minutes at current velocity. They're staying behind their screen, using the cruisers and destroyers for cover."

Anderson pulled up the tactical plot. The bombers were moving in formation, protected by the Ryzak screening elements. The Federation Talons were engaged with interceptors, still outnumbered despite the arrival of Earth's squadrons. The corvettes were scattered across the engagement zone, harassing targets of opportunity.

Nobody was in position to stop twelve bombers from reaching *Vanguard*.

> "Helm, evasive pattern gamma. Point defense, prioritize anti-bomber protocols. *Sentinel*, this is *Vanguard*—we have bombers inbound, vector two-seven-three. Recommend evasive maneuvers."

The response from *Sentinel*'s captain came immediately.

> "Acknowledged, *Vanguard*. We see them. Maneuvering now."

Both Federation ships began to move, thrusters firing, changing course to complicate the bombers' attack runs. But battleships were large, slow targets. Evasive maneuvers helped, but they wouldn't be enough against dedicated bomber craft.

> "Alert all Talon squadrons," Anderson ordered. "We need fighter cover on *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* immediately."

---

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas heard the call and checked his tactical display. His element was engaged with Ryzak interceptors thirty thousand meters from the Federation battleships, trading shots in the ongoing furball that had consumed the engagement zone.

> "Delta Flight, this is Delta Lead. *Vanguard* is calling for bomber intercept. Break off current engagement, vector one-one-five."

> "Delta-Two, copy. Breaking now."

> "Delta-Three, with you."

> "Delta-Four, on your six."

The four Portuguese Talons disengaged from the interceptor fight, their engines burning hard as they accelerated toward the new threat. Miguel's HUD showed the bomber formation—twelve heavy craft, each one carrying torpedo loads that could cripple a battleship.

He also saw the Ryzak screening elements between his flight and the bombers. Three destroyers, positioned specifically to prevent exactly what he was attempting.

> "Delta Flight, we've got a screen. Destroyers at bearing zero-nine-zero. We'll need to punch through."

> "Delta-Two, I'm reading point defense active. They're expecting us."

Miguel's tactical computer updated with intercept solutions. The destroyers were well-positioned, their point defense fields overlapping, creating a zone of fire that would be costly to penetrate. But the bombers were continuing their approach to *Vanguard*, and if they reached launch range unopposed, the battleship would take catastrophic damage.

> "Delta Flight, we go through. Arm missiles, full spread on the lead destroyer. Fire on my mark."

Four Talons, sixteen missiles total. Against a destroyer with active point defense and supporting escorts.

Miguel armed his weapons and pushed his throttle forward.

---

Aboard *Vanguard*, Captain Anderson watched the tactical display as multiple Talon elements broke from the interceptor engagement and vectored toward the bomber formation. Portuguese, American, Japanese—all of them responding to the call, trying to reach the bombers before they could launch.

But the Ryzak screen was holding. The destroyers' point defense was active, creating kill zones that the Talons would have to fly through. Some would make it. Some wouldn't.

> "Bombers at two minutes to launch range," the tactical officer reported.

> "All batteries, engage the screening elements. I want those destroyers suppressed."

*Vanguard*'s railguns spoke, tungsten-carbide rounds screaming toward the Ryzak destroyers. The destroyers' shields flared as they absorbed the impacts, but they held. The cruisers behind them were adding their own fire support, particle beams lancing toward *Vanguard*, forcing the battleship to split her attention between offensive and defensive operations.

The bombers continued their approach, now ninety seconds from launch range.

On the tactical display, Anderson watched the Portuguese element—Delta Flight—launch their missiles at the lead destroyer. Sixteen weapons, spreading as they tracked toward the target. The destroyer's point defense engaged, railgun turrets tracking, firing. The first missile died, then the second, then four more.

But ten made it through.

The destroyer's shields buckled under the concentrated strike, the defensive field failing in two sections. The follow-up missiles punched through bare hull, shaped-charge warheads detonating against armor. The destroyer rolled, venting atmosphere, its formation position compromised.

The Portuguese Talons dove through the gap, their plasma lances firing as they engaged the bomber formation directly.

Three bombers died in the first exchange, their heavy frames unable to maneuver like interceptors, unable to evade the concentrated fire from four Talons. A fourth bomber's shields failed, its wing sections shearing away under sustained fire.

But there were still eight bombers, and they were in launch range.

> "Bombers launching torpedoes!" the sensor operator called out. "Multiple weapons, inbound on our position!"

The tactical display lit up with red icons—capital ship torpedoes, each one carrying warheads designed to punch through battleship armor. Twenty-four weapons total, spread across two salvos targeting both *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*.

> "Point defense, engage! All batteries, maximum rate!"

*Vanguard*'s point defense turrets came alive, railguns tracking the incoming torpedoes, firing in rapid sequence. The first torpedo died at eight thousand meters, its warhead detonating prematurely. The second and third followed. But there were too many, coming from too many vectors.

Four torpedoes penetrated the point defense screen.

The first struck *Vanguard*'s port shields, the defensive field flaring brilliantly as it struggled to dissipate the shaped-charge detonation. The shield held, but barely. The second torpedo hit the same section three seconds later, and the shields failed.

The third torpedo punched through bare armor.

The shaped-charge warhead detonated against *Vanguard*'s hull, the plasma jet carving through armor plating, through the first bulkhead, through the second. The penetration reached a secondary magazine, and the stored munitions cooked off in a cascade of explosions.

The battleship shuddered violently, alarms shrieking across every station.

> "Direct hit, port side, sections twelve through fifteen!" damage control reported. "Multiple compartment breaches, secondary explosions, fires in three sections. We've lost two secondary batteries and the aft port shield generator."

The fourth torpedo hit moments later, striking the already-damaged section, driving deeper into the battleship's interior. More explosions, more breaches, more systems failing.

Anderson gripped his command chair as the ship bucked beneath him.

> "Damage report!"

> "Port side is compromised, sir. We've got structural damage to the main frame, shields are failing in multiple quadrants. Engineering reports—" the officer's voice cut off as another alarm sounded. "Sir, we've got containment warnings in the reactor section. The damage is affecting coolant flow."

> "Can they stabilize it?"

> "They're trying, sir, but if we take another hit in that area—"

Anderson looked at the tactical display. *Sentinel* had taken torpedo hits as well, her shields failing, her hull showing damage indicators across multiple sections. Both Federation battleships were hurt, their combat effectiveness degrading rapidly.

And the Ryzak bombers were still out there, repositioning for another attack run.

> "Sir, recommend we withdraw," his XO said quietly. "If we stay in the fight, we risk losing both ships."

Anderson stared at the display. The *Wrath of Dominion* was still there, still sustained by the carrier's shield projection, still fighting. If *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* withdrew, the Ryzak battleship would be free to target the corvettes, or worse, to begin bombardment operations against the Federation's remaining assets.

But if they stayed, they'd die.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Anderson asked.

> "Four hours, twelve minutes, sir."

Four hours. They'd held for nearly three already. Four more seemed impossible.

Another proximity alarm shrieked. The bombers were lining up for a second attack run.

> "Helm, set course for Jovian Shipyards. Maximum velocity. *Sentinel*, this is *Vanguard*—we're withdrawing for emergency repairs. Recommend you do the same."

There was a pause, then *Sentinel*'s captain responded.

> "Acknowledged, *Vanguard*. We're with you."

Both battleships began to turn, their engines burning hard, accelerating away from the engagement zone. The Ryzak bombers pursued for several thousand meters, but without their screening elements' support, they were vulnerable to the Talon squadrons. Two more bombers died to concentrated fire before the survivors broke off and returned to the carrier.

Anderson watched the tactical display as *Vanguard* pulled away from the battle, her damaged hull trailing frozen atmosphere, her shields flickering.

They'd held the line for three hours. They'd bloodied the Ryzak fleet, eliminated two carriers, destroyed multiple battleships and cruisers.

But now the Federation's last two operational battleships were withdrawing, damaged and unable to continue the fight.

The Ryzak *Wrath of Dominion*, despite everything, despite the concentrated fire, despite the losses around it, remained operational.

And four hours still remained until Third North Fleet could arrive.

The tactical situation had just become critical.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:12:07**

### Desperate Measures

Commander Sarah Chen stood in Galileo Station's operations center, staring at the tactical display with mounting dread. The icon representing *Vanguard* was moving away from the engagement zone, trailing damage indicators. *Sentinel* followed close behind. Both battleships were withdrawing, their hulls compromised, their combat effectiveness reduced to near zero.

Which left the engagement zone defended by Talons, three corvettes, and eighteen automated defense platforms that were already running low on ammunition.

Against one Ryzak battleship, one carrier, and their remaining screening elements.

> "Fleet status update," Chen said quietly.

Lieutenant Marcus Webb pulled up the summary, his expression grim.

> "All Federation battleships withdrawn or destroyed. *Typhoon* is still at Jovian Shipyards undergoing emergency repairs, ETA thirty-two minutes. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* are en route to the yards, both critically damaged. Talon squadrons are still engaged but running low on ammunition. We're rotating them through resupply, but the tempo is unsustainable."

Chen looked at the Ryzak formation on the display. The *Wrath of Dominion* sat at the center, shields still being sustained by the carrier *Storm Bringer*. Cruisers and destroyers formed a protective screen. The remaining bombers had returned to the carrier, presumably rearming for another strike.

> "What's their tactical posture?"

> "Defensive, ma'am. They're holding position, not advancing. It's like they're... waiting for something."

Chen's jaw tightened. Waiting. The Ryzak had achieved local superiority, forced the Federation capital ships out of the engagement zone, and now they were consolidating their position.

For what?

Her communications console chimed. Priority channel from HARBINGER.

> "Commander Chen, I must advise you of a developing situation."

The AI's geometric form appeared on her screen, pulsing an urgent blue-white.

> "Go ahead, HARBINGER."

> "The Ryzak fleet is repositioning. Vector analysis suggests they are preparing for system departure. Projected course suggests they intend to proceed to Earth."

Chen felt ice settle in her chest.

> "They're going for the planet. They know we can't stop them."

> "Correct. With Federation capital ship assets neutralized, the Ryzak possess overwhelming firepower advantage against terrestrial targets. Talon squadrons cannot prevent orbital bombardment operations."

Chen pulled up the navigation overlay, watching as HARBINGER's projection traced the Ryzak fleet's likely course. From the beacon to Earth. A straight line. No obstacles. No defenses capable of stopping them.

Chen looked at the reinforcement timer.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:11:33**

Four hours until Third North Fleet arrived. The Ryzak could reach Earth in less than that. They could establish orbital positions, begin bombardment operations, and Earth's defenses—conventional military forces with no experience fighting capital ships—would be helpless.

Billions of people. Defenseless.

> "Ma'am," Webb called out, his voice tight. "The Ryzak formation is moving. They're... they're accelerating. Vector confirms—they're heading for Earth."

Chen watched the red icons on the display begin to move, pulling away from the beacon, orienting toward the inner system. The battleship, the carrier, all the screening elements. Moving together, accelerating steadily.

> "Warp signatures building," the sensor operator added. "They're preparing to jump. Ma'am, they're leaving. They're going to Earth."

The operations center fell silent. Every officer, every technician, every person in the room understood what that meant. The Ryzak had won the engagement at the beacon. Now they were moving to the real objective.

Earth.

> "Ma'am," Webb said quietly. "The ships are accelerating for warp. It's over, ma'am."

Chen stared at the display, at the red icons picking up speed, at the warp drive signatures building in intensity. Her fists clenched at her sides.

> "Nothing's over while we're breathing!"

The operations center fell silent, every head turning toward her. Chen straightened, her mind racing through options, through contingencies, through every possible asset they had left.

And then she remembered.

The briefing from three months ago. The theoretical weapon system. The one that had never been tested, never been activated, never been used because the calculations suggested it might work but nobody was sure. The one that engineering had classified as "experimental and potentially catastrophic."

FLYCATCHER.

> "HARBINGER," Chen said, her voice steady despite the adrenaline flooding her system. "What's the status of the FLYCATCHER system?"

There was a pause. The AI's geometric form flickered, processing.

> "FLYCATCHER is installed and theoretically operational. However, Commander, I must remind you that the system has never been tested under combat conditions. The theoretical models suggest significant risk—"

> "I don't need the safety briefing. I need to know if it will work."

Another pause.

> "Theoretical probability of successful activation: seventy-two percent. Probability of catastrophic failure resulting in station destruction: eighteen percent. Probability of partial success with unknown consequences: ten percent."

> "And if it works, what's the effective range?"

> "Projected disruption field radius: two hundred fifty kilometers, centered on Galileo Station. All vessels within this sphere will be unable to form stable warp tunnels. Duration is dependent on power reserves—estimated operational time is four hours before primary systems begin to fail."

Chen looked at the tactical display. The Ryzak fleet was still accelerating, warp signatures building. In less than two minutes, they'd jump. And once they were in warp, nothing could stop them from reaching Earth.

Four hours until reinforcements arrived.

Four hours of FLYCATCHER operational time.

The math was brutal. But it was the only option left.

> "All stations, this is Commander Chen. Prepare for emergency protocol FLYCATCHER activation. Engineering, bring the gravity generators to full power and stand by for field inversion. All personnel, secure loose equipment and prepare for zero-gravity operations."

Webb looked at her, his eyes wide.

> "Ma'am, are you sure? If this fails—"

> "If this fails, we're in the same situation we're in now. If it works, we buy four hours. That's all we need."

She turned to the communications console.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is Galileo Station. We are activating emergency countermeasures in sixty seconds. All vessels within two hundred fifty kilometers of the station will be unable to form warp tunnels. This includes friendly forces. Acknowledge and prepare for extended combat operations."

The responses came back immediately from the Talon squadrons, from the corvettes, from *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* as they pulled away from the engagement zone. Confusion, questions, but ultimately acknowledgment.

Chen pulled up the FLYCATCHER control interface. The system was housed deep in Galileo Station's core, wrapped around the primary gravity generator. The concept was elegant in its simplicity: take the generator that created artificial gravity throughout the station and invert its field projection, creating a sphere of chaotic gravitational noise that would prevent warp tunnel formation.

The side effect was that gravity aboard the station would drop to zero. Everything not secured would become a projectile. Every system would need to operate in microgravity. And if the power draw was miscalculated, if the field became unstable, the generator could tear itself apart and take the station with it.

But if it worked, the Ryzak fleet would be trapped. Unable to warp. Unable to reach Earth.

Forced to fight for four more hours until Third North Fleet arrived.

> "Engineering reports ready, ma'am," Webb said. "Gravity generators at full power. Field inversion protocols loaded. Awaiting your command."

Chen took a breath. On the tactical display, the Ryzak warp signatures were reaching critical levels. Thirty seconds until they jumped.

She thought of Earth, of billions of people who had no idea what was happening, who would wake up tomorrow to either freedom or subjugation depending on what happened in the next few minutes.

> "HARBINGER, transmit activation code. All hands, brace for zero gravity."

The AI's geometric form pulsed once.

> "Activation code transmitted. FLYCATCHER engaging in three... two... one..."

Deep in Galileo Station's core, the gravity generator's field inverted.

The change was instantaneous. Every object not secured to a surface suddenly had no weight. Coffee cups floated away from desks. Data pads drifted upward. Personnel grabbed handholds, magnetic boots activating automatically, securing them to the deck plates.

But the real effect was external.

A sphere of distorted space-time expanded outward from the station at the speed of light, two hundred fifty kilometers in radius, a bubble of chaotic gravitational noise. Not a physical barrier—ships could still maneuver through it, still fire weapons, still operate normally.

But warp drives required stable space-time to function. They needed to fold reality in precise, calculable ways. The FLYCATCHER field made that impossible. Every point in space within the sphere was experiencing random gravitational fluctuations, making it impossible to form the stable tunnel needed for faster-than-light travel.

Aboard the *Wrath of Dominion*, alarms shrieked.

The battleship's warp drive, fully charged and ready to engage, suddenly detected catastrophic instability in the surrounding space-time. Safety protocols engaged automatically, dumping power, shutting down the drive before it could tear the ship apart.

Across the Ryzak fleet, the same thing happened. Every ship, from the carrier *Storm Bringer* to the smallest destroyer, experienced simultaneous warp drive failure. Not damage—the drives were fine. But the space around them had become impossible to navigate at faster-than-light speeds.

They were trapped.

And so was everyone else within two hundred fifty kilometers of Galileo Station.

The Federation Talons, still engaged with Ryzak interceptors, suddenly found their emergency jump-out protocols unavailable. The corvettes couldn't retreat to safe distance. Even *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*, limping toward Jovian Shipyards, discovered their warp drives were non-functional as long as they remained within the disruption sphere.

Everyone was stuck.

No jumping out. No jumping in. No warp travel of any kind.

Just conventional drives, weapons, and shields.

For the next four hours.

Commander Chen floated in Galileo Station's operations center, her magnetic boots keeping her anchored to the deck, and watched the tactical display. The Ryzak fleet had stopped accelerating toward Earth. Their warp signatures had collapsed. They were trapped in the engagement zone.

Together with every Federation and Earth asset in the system.

> "FLYCATCHER is active," HARBINGER reported. "Disruption field stable at two hundred fifty kilometers radius. Ryzak fleet vector change detected—they are reorienting toward the station."

Of course they were. Chen had just trapped them, prevented them from reaching Earth. They couldn't ignore that.

> "Power reserves?" Chen asked.

> "Current draw is within acceptable parameters. Estimated operational time: four hours, seven minutes. Sufficient to maintain field until Third North Fleet arrival."

Four hours, seven minutes.

Chen looked at the red icons on the display, now turning, now vectoring back toward Galileo Station. The Ryzak weren't retreating. They were coming to destroy the source of the disruption field.

They were coming for the station.

> "All hands," Chen said into the station-wide comm, her voice calm despite floating in zero gravity with a Ryzak battle fleet bearing down on them. "This is Commander Chen. We have activated FLYCATCHER. The Ryzak cannot reach Earth. They cannot escape. And in four hours, Third North Fleet will arrive with overwhelming force."

She paused, looking around the operations center at her crew floating at their stations, working in microgravity, preparing for what came next.

> "Our job is to survive until they get here. All defensive systems to full combat readiness. All personnel to battle stations. We're going to show the Ryzak what it means to corner a Federation station."

She closed the channel and turned to Webb.

> "Time to reinforcements?"

> "Four hours, six minutes, ma'am."

Chen looked at the tactical display one more time. The Ryzak fleet was accelerating toward them now, no longer trying to reach Earth, focused entirely on destroying Galileo Station and the disruption field it was projecting.

One station. Minimal defenses. Against a Ryzak battle fleet.

For four hours.

> "HARBINGER," Chen said quietly. "Alert all Talon squadrons. Tell them to form up around the station. We're about to become the most important target in the solar system."

> "Acknowledged, Commander. Transmitting now."

The geometric form pulsed, and across the engagement zone, every Federation and Earth pilot received the same message:

Defend Galileo Station. At all costs. For four hours.

And if the station fell, Earth fell with it.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:06:18**

### Window of Opportunity

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas felt the change immediately. His Talon's warp drive, which had been on standby for emergency jump-out procedures, suddenly went dark. Warning indicators flashed across his HUD, then resolved into a simple message:

**WARP DRIVE INOPERABLE - GRAVITATIONAL INSTABILITY DETECTED**

> "Delta Flight, this is Delta Lead. Anyone else getting warp drive failures?"

> "Delta-Two, confirmed. Drive's offline. What the hell just happened?"

Then HARBINGER's voice cut through the tactical net, calm and precise despite what it was announcing.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is HARBINGER. Galileo Station has activated FLYCATCHER protocol. Warp disruption field is now active in a two hundred fifty kilometer radius centered on the station. All vessels within this sphere cannot engage warp drives. Repeat: warp travel is impossible within the disruption field."

Miguel checked his tactical display. The field was marked now, a blue sphere centered on Galileo Station. His Talon was well inside it, as were all the other fighters, the corvettes, and the entire Ryzak fleet.

Trapped. All of them.

> "Delta Flight, does this affect our sublight drives?"

> "Delta-Two checking... negative, Lead. Fusion drives are nominal. We can still maneuver at sublight."

Miguel's mind raced through the implications. No warp capability meant no jumping to Jovian Shipyards for emergency resupply. The bigger capital ships were stuck inside the field for the duration.

But fighters were different.

Talons were fast at sublight speeds. The disruption field was 250 kilometers in radius. At maximum thrust, a Talon could clear that distance in—Miguel ran the quick calculation—eight, maybe nine minutes. Exit the field, warp drive would come back online, jump to the yards, rearm, jump back, re-enter the field at sublight.

It would take longer than the previous instant jump-out protocol. Much longer. But it was still viable.

> "Delta Flight, listen up. We can still rotate for resupply. Eight minutes to clear the field at maximum burn, then standard jump protocols to the yards. Thirty to thirty-five minutes total per cycle. It's not ideal, but it works."

> "Delta-Two, understood. That's... actually not bad. We can maintain combat operations."

> "Delta-Three confirms. We're not trapped like the capital ships."

Miguel keyed the general tactical net.

> "All Talon squadrons, this is Delta Lead. Fighter resupply is still viable through conventional transit. Eight minutes to clear FLYCATCHER field, then standard jump to Jovian Shipyards. We can keep fighting."

There was a brief pause, then HARBINGER's voice came through, carrying what might have been approval.

> "Delta Lead, correct assessment. Talon craft possess sufficient sublight velocity to exit disruption field and maintain resupply rotation. All squadrons are cleared for conventional transit protocols."

Then Major Ellie Morse's voice cut through the net, sharp and focused.

> "All squadrons, this is Viper Lead. The Ryzak just lost warp capability same as us. Check your sensors—they're showing confusion in their formation. Their bombers are exposed, no screening elements in position. This is our window. Hit them now while they're sorting themselves out."

Miguel pulled up his tactical display and felt a surge of understanding. The Ryzak fleet had been accelerating for warp jump, their formation optimized for transit rather than combat. The bombers—eight surviving craft loaded with capital ship torpedoes—were positioned behind the screening elements but ahead of the main battle line.

And now the Ryzak were dealing with sudden, unexpected warp drive failure across their entire fleet. Alarms would be shrieking on every ship. Crews would be checking systems, running diagnostics, trying to understand what had just happened.

They were distracted. Vulnerable.

And the bombers were exposed.

> "Delta Flight, this is Delta Lead. Viper's right. We take those bombers now. They're the biggest threat to the station. Arm all weapons, maximum thrust, engage on my mark."

> "Delta-Two, ready."

> "Delta-Three, with you."

> "Delta-Four, weapons hot."

Across the engagement zone, every Talon squadron received the same realization. Portuguese, American, Japanese—all of them seeing the same opportunity, all of them vectoring toward the exposed bomber formation.

Sixty-one Earth Talons, plus the twenty-seven Federation fighters that had just finished resupply rotation. Eighty-eight fighters total, converging on eight bombers.

The math was suddenly very favorable.

---

Aboard the Ryzak bomber *Deathbringer*, pilot Kresh'mar was still trying to understand the warp drive failure when his threat receiver shrieked a warning.

Multiple contacts. Small, fast, closing from multiple vectors. His tactical display lit up with targeting locks—dozens of them, all focused on his bomber group.

The Federation fighters. All of them. Coming in coordinated attack.

> "Bomber group, break formation! Evasive maneuvers! Request immediate escort support!"

But the escort destroyers were still reorienting, still processing their own warp drive failures. The carrier's interceptors were scattered across the engagement zone, not positioned to protect the bombers. The cruisers were focused on the battleship's defensive screen.

The bombers were alone.

Kresh'mar threw his craft into a hard turn, his secondary eyelids flickering as g-forces compressed his body. Bombers weren't built for this kind of maneuvering—they were heavy, designed for straight attack runs against capital ships, not dogfighting with interceptors.

His threat receiver was solid red now. Missile locks. Energy weapon locks. The Federation fighters were firing.

---

Miguel's targeting computer locked onto the lead bomber, the craft's heavy frame filling his HUD. At eight thousand meters, he squeezed the trigger.

The plasma lance shot out, crossing the distance in less than a second. The bomber tried to evade, rolling hard, but it was too slow, too heavy. The lance caught it on the port engine section, burning through shields weakened by previous combat, carving into the drive assembly.

The bomber's engine exploded, the craft tumbling as thrust vectored wildly from the remaining engine. Miguel didn't wait to confirm the kill. His wingman was already firing on the same target, the second plasma lance punching through what remained of the bomber's shields and coring the cockpit section.

The bomber broke apart, trailing debris and frozen atmosphere.

> "Delta Lead, splash one bomber. Engaging second target."

Around him, the sky was full of tracers and plasma fire as eighty-eight Talons tore into eight bombers. The Ryzak pilots were trying to evade, trying to maneuver, trying to survive, but they were heavy craft being swarmed by faster, more agile fighters.

It was a massacre.

Major Morse rolled her Talon onto a bomber trying to dive away from the furball, lined up the shot, and fired. Her plasma lance punched through the bomber's aft shields, the superheated matter carving through the weapons bay. The stored torpedoes detonated sympathetically, the bomber disappearing in a brilliant flash.

> "Viper-One, splash two. Hell Ravens, I count three more bombers still active. Let's clean this up."

Major Tanaka—"Okuu"—led her Japanese squadron in a coordinated strike on a bomber that had managed to gain some separation from the pack. Sixteen Talons, firing in sequence, overwhelming the bomber's point defense through sheer volume of fire. The bomber lasted three seconds before its shields failed and multiple plasma lances found critical systems.

> "Hell Raven Lead, that's four down. Five. Six."

The seventh bomber died to concentrated missile fire from a mixed element of Portuguese and American Talons, shaped-charge warheads detonating against its hull in rapid succession.

The eighth and final bomber, its pilot desperate, tried to run. Full thrust toward the edge of the engagement zone, trying to gain distance, trying to survive. But there were too many fighters, too many angles of attack. Delta Flight caught it from above, Viper Squadron from the side, Hell Ravens from below.

The bomber died in a crossfire of plasma lances, its hull coming apart in sections, escape pods jettisoning in all directions as the crew abandoned ship.

> "All bombers destroyed," HARBINGER reported over the tactical net, its voice carrying a note of satisfaction. "Ryzak heavy strike capability neutralized. Galileo Station threat level reduced significantly."

Miguel checked his tactical display. Where eight bomber icons had been thirty seconds ago, there was now just debris. The Ryzak fleet was still there—battleship, carrier, cruisers, destroyers—but their ability to deliver decisive strikes against the station had been eliminated.

> "All Talon squadrons, this is Station Command," Commander Chen's voice came through, steady despite the zero-gravity environment she was operating in. "Excellent work. Regroup and establish defensive perimeter around Galileo Station. The Ryzak will be coming for us now. Make them pay for every meter."

Miguel vectored his Talon toward the station, his weapons depleted but his craft still functional. Around him, the other fighters were doing the same, forming up into a defensive sphere around Galileo Station.

Eighty-eight fighters, spread across a 250-kilometer radius, protecting one station.

Against one Ryzak battleship, one carrier, and all their remaining escorts.

For four hours.

But now, at least, the Ryzak couldn't threaten the station with massed torpedo strikes. They'd have to come in close, fight through the fighter screen, expose themselves to concentrated fire.

And the Talons would make them bleed for every attempt.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:01:47**

### The Long Siege

Three hours and seventeen minutes.

That's how long Galileo Station had been under siege.

Commander Sarah Chen floated at her station in the operations center, magnetic boots keeping her anchored to the deck in the zero-gravity environment. The displays around her showed damage indicators spreading across the station's exterior, shield strength fluctuating, power distribution diagrams glowing amber and red.

The *Wrath of Dominion* had been methodically hammering the station for over three hours, maintaining standoff range where the battleship's particle beams could reach but the station's limited defensive armament couldn't effectively respond. The Ryzak cruisers and destroyers formed a protective screen, engaging any Talons that got too close, forcing the fighters to dance at the edge of effective range.

It was a siege. Slow, grinding, inexorable.

And the station was losing.

> "Commander, another hit on section seven," Lieutenant Webb reported, his voice carrying the strain of hours in zero gravity. "Shields absorbed it, but we're down to sixty-two percent capacity. Engineering is requesting additional power."

Chen pulled up the power distribution overlay. Every system on the station was already running hot, pushed beyond normal operational parameters. The gravity generator that had been inverted to create the FLYCATCHER field was drawing massive amounts of power. Life support, shields, weapons, sensors—all competing for limited reactor output.

> "Reroute from non-essential systems. Environmental controls in the habitation sections, reduce to minimum. Strip power from anywhere that won't kill us immediately."

> "Already done, ma'am. We're pulling from every available source. Engineering reports the powerplants are running at one hundred twenty-five percent of rated capacity."

One hundred twenty-five percent. Chen had worked in engineering before her command track. She knew what that meant. Reactor cores running at temperatures they weren't designed to sustain. Cooling systems struggling to keep up. Power conduits stressed beyond their specifications.

If they maintained this output much longer, systems would start failing. Not from enemy fire—from simple thermal overload.

> "How long can we sustain one-twenty-five?"

Webb consulted his displays, conferring quietly with the engineering station.

> "Engineering estimates... ninety minutes before we start seeing cascading failures. Maybe two hours if we're lucky. They're already seeing stress fractures in the primary coolant loops."

Chen looked at the chronometer.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 00:44:18**

Forty-four minutes until Third North Fleet arrived. Ninety minutes until the station's powerplants started failing.

The math worked. Barely.

Another impact shuddered through the station, the particle beam from the *Wrath of Dominion* striking the shields. The defensive field flared brilliant white on the external cameras, dissipating the energy, but Chen could see the power draw spike on her displays.

> "Shields at fifty-eight percent," Webb reported. "That last hit stressed the forward generators. We're compensating with backup systems."

> "Talon status?"

> "Sixty-one operational. We've lost twenty-seven over the past three hours. Most are rotating through resupply at Jovian Shipyards, but the cycle time means we've only got about forty fighters in the engagement zone at any given moment."

Sixty-one operational. Chen remembered when Earth's squadrons had arrived—fresh, eager, untested. Eighty-eight Talons total. Now they were down to sixty-one, and that number kept dropping.

Every fifteen or twenty minutes, another icon would blink out on the tactical display. A Ryzak interceptor would get a lucky shot. A destroyer's point defense would track just fast enough. A pilot would make a mistake, push too hard, misjudge a vector.

The Talons were bleeding. Slowly, steadily, inexorably.

> "Ma'am, we've got another Talon down," the sensor operator called out. "Viper-Seven took concentrated fire from two destroyers. Pilot ejected, search and rescue corvette is moving to recover."

Chen watched the icon disappear from the tactical display. Viper-Seven. She didn't know the pilot's name, didn't know if they were American, Portuguese, Japanese. Didn't matter. They'd been defending the station, and now they were drifting in an escape pod, waiting for pickup.

If the station fell before Third North Fleet arrived, those rescue operations would become meaningless. The Ryzak would hunt down the escape pods at their leisure.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Chen asked, though she'd checked the chronometer less than two minutes ago.

> "Forty-two minutes, ma'am."

Forty-two minutes. Two thousand five hundred twenty seconds. She could count them if she wanted. Count down to salvation or destruction.

Another particle beam struck the shields. Then another. The *Wrath of Dominion* was maintaining a steady tempo of fire, not rushing, not pressing hard. Just methodically wearing down the station's defenses.

The battleship knew the math as well as Chen did. They had time. All they needed to do was keep shooting, keep the pressure on, and eventually the station's shields would fail.

Then the hull. Then the reactor. Then everyone aboard.

> "Commander, HARBINGER is requesting communication," Webb said.

Chen pulled up the AI's interface. The geometric form appeared on her screen, pulsing a steady blue that might have been concern.

> "Commander Chen, I must advise you of a developing situation."

> "More good news?"

> "Shield integrity is declining at current rate of Ryzak fire. Projections indicate shield failure in approximately fifty-three minutes. This is within acceptable margins for Third North Fleet arrival, but there is minimal buffer for unexpected complications."

Chen studied the numbers. Fifty-three minutes until shield failure. Forty-four minutes until Third North Fleet arrived.

Nine minutes of margin. Not much, but enough. If the Ryzak didn't increase their fire rate. If the shields degraded at a constant pace. If nothing else went wrong.

Too many ifs.

> "What happens if they press harder? Concentrate fire?"

> "Shield failure timeline would accelerate. Current Ryzak fire tempo appears calibrated to methodical degradation rather than rapid assault. However, if they recognize our temporal constraints and increase aggression, margin for error disappears entirely."

Chen looked at the tactical display. The *Wrath of Dominion* was maintaining steady fire, not rushing, not pressing. The Ryzak fleet commander was playing it safe, letting time do the work.

But if they realized how close it was, if they understood the Federation reinforcements were less than an hour away...

> "Options to extend shield duration?"

> "We can increase power to shields, but this will accelerate reactor stress. Engineering estimates complete powerplant failure would occur in approximately ninety-eight minutes under increased load. Alternatively, we can maintain current power distribution and accept shield failure at fifty-three minutes. The optimal scenario requires precise timing—maintaining current configuration until Third North Fleet arrival provides highest probability of station survival."

So the math was tight, but viable. They just needed the Ryzak to keep doing exactly what they were doing for forty-four more minutes.

And they needed nothing to go wrong.

Chen thought of the billions of people on the planet below, who had no idea this battle was happening, who would wake up tomorrow to either freedom or subjugation depending on decisions made in the next few minutes.

She thought of the Talons out there, sixty-one fighters and their pilots, bleeding slowly to buy these final minutes.

> "We maintain current configuration," Chen said, her voice steady. "Keep FLYCATCHER at full power. Keep the shields up as long as we can. We just need to last long enough."

HARBINGER's geometric form pulsed acknowledgment.

> "Understood, Commander. Maintaining current configuration."

Another impact. Shields at fifty-four percent. Then fifty-one. The *Wrath of Dominion* was picking up its rate of fire, sensing weakness, pressing harder.

Chen pulled up the fleet-wide channel.

> "All Talon squadrons, this is Station Command. We're forty minutes from Third North Fleet arrival. The Ryzak know we're running out of time, and they're pressing hard. I need every fighter you have, every weapon you can bring to bear. Make them work for every shot. Make them pay for every second."

She paused, floating in zero gravity, watching the tactical display show sixty-one blue icons scattered across the engagement zone, dancing with Ryzak interceptors, harassing destroyers, trying desperately to draw fire away from the station.

> "We've held for three hours. We can hold for forty more minutes. Earth is counting on us. Don't let them down."

She closed the channel and turned back to the displays. Shield strength dropping. Power systems strained to the breaking point. The countdown timer ticking steadily toward reinforcement arrival.

Forty minutes.

They just had to survive forty more minutes.
