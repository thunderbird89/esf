## Chapter 6: Debrief

The approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport felt almost surreal after everything Marisa had experienced. Shade descended through normal airspace at normal speeds, following standard approach vectors like any other aircraft. The only difference was that air traffic control couldn't see them—their radar screens showing clear skies while a forty-meter spacecraft glided silently toward the runway.

> "Final approach, Runway Zero-One," Shade announced with the same clinical precision it had maintained throughout the flight. "Local time zero-six-thirty-seven. Weather is clear, winds light and variable."

Through the viewport, Marisa could see the Potomac River winding through the dawn landscape, the Washington Monument catching the early morning light. The city was waking up, traffic beginning to build on the highways, people starting another ordinary day completely unaware that two EMP devices had nearly turned San Francisco into a dead zone just hours earlier.

The landing was as gentle as the takeoff had been brutal twelve hours ago. Shade touched down on a service runway away from the main terminal, rolling to a stop near what looked like an abandoned maintenance hangar. The kind of place where aircraft came to be forgotten, not to discharge passengers who had just returned from preventing a catastrophic terrorist attack.

As the engines wound down, Marisa noticed that LeBouf and his team had changed clothes during the flight. Gone were the tactical vests, the combat gear, the obvious military hardware. Now they wore civilian clothing—khakis, polo shirts, light jackets that could have come from any department store. LeBouf himself had traded his operational kit for a navy blue windbreaker and dark slacks, looking every inch the unremarkable federal employee.

But there was something about the way the clothes fit that bothered Marisa. The jackets hung just slightly wrong, as if they were concealing more than they revealed. The fabric looked ordinary but moved in ways that suggested hidden reinforcement. Even the shoes—simple leather oxfords—seemed just a shade too substantial for their apparent purpose.

> "FBI team, we'll be taking separate vehicles back to headquarters," LeBouf said as the restraints retracted. "Standard procedure—we maintain operational security until the formal debrief is complete."

The cargo bay revealed the same two Q-cars they'd used in San Francisco—the silver Honda Accord and the dark blue Toyota Camry. No additional vehicles, no government fleet cars. Just the same unremarkable sedans that had carried them through the Mission District at impossible speeds, now looking every inch like the rental cars they were supposed to be.

Marisa and her team climbed back into the Honda while LeBouf's group took the Toyota. As they pulled away from the hangar, Marisa looked back to see Shade's ramp retracting, the craft beginning its transition back to invisibility. Within moments, there was nothing but empty tarmac and the faint smell of jet fuel in the air.

The drive through Washington morning traffic felt like stepping back into a different world. Normal cars driven by normal people heading to normal jobs, their biggest concerns probably centered around coffee and commute times. Marisa watched them through the Honda's windows—a woman in a Civic talking on her phone, a man in a pickup truck checking his reflection in the side mirror, teenagers in a beat-up Corolla laughing at something on someone's phone.

None of them knew how close the world had come to chaos. None of them would ever know.

The FBI's J. Edgar Hoover Building rose ahead of them, its brutalist concrete facade as imposing as ever in the morning light. Marisa had walked through those doors thousands of times, but today felt different. Today she was bringing back secrets that couldn't be written in any report, experiences that couldn't be shared with anyone who didn't already know.

They pulled into the underground garage, the Honda's ordinary appearance getting them through security without question. LeBouf's Toyota was already parked when they arrived, its occupants nowhere to be seen. Marisa suspected they were already inside, probably in a conference room she didn't know existed, preparing for a debriefing that would never appear on any official schedule.

> "Seventh floor," Hartfield said as they stepped into the elevator. "Assistant Director Reeves wants to see us immediately."

Marisa nodded, trying to prepare herself for what was coming. How do you brief your superior on a mission that officially never happened? How do you explain that you've just returned from space, that you've worked with an artificial intelligence that could have stepped out of science fiction, that you've witnessed capabilities that made the FBI's most advanced technologies look like stone tools?

The elevator climbed through the building's floors, each one representing layers of the federal law enforcement bureaucracy. But somewhere above or below or parallel to this official structure was another world entirely—the shadow realm where the EarthSpace Federation operated, where Q-cars masqueraded as rental sedans and spacecraft launched from parking lots in New Jersey.

Marisa caught herself studying LeBouf's reflection in the elevator's polished metal doors. Even in civilian clothes, there was something about his posture, his alertness, that marked him as different. And those clothes—she was becoming more convinced that they weren't as ordinary as they appeared. The way his jacket fell suggested weight distribution that didn't match simple cotton or wool. The seams were too precise, the cut too accommodating for someone who needed to move quickly and quietly.

What kind of technology was woven into fabric that looked like it came from a mall department store? What capabilities were hidden in plain sight, disguised as the mundane uniform of federal bureaucracy?

The elevator chimed softly as it reached the seventh floor, the doors sliding open to reveal the familiar corridors of FBI leadership. But as Marisa stepped out, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was crossing from one world into another—from the realm of impossible possibilities back into the comfortable illusion of normal government operations.

And somewhere in the space between those worlds, the real work of protecting the country continued, invisible and unacknowledged, carried out by people whose ordinary appearances concealed extraordinary capabilities.

The question was: which world did she belong to now?
