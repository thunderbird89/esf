## Chapter 5: Homecoming

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas brought his Talon through Galileo Station's docking bay entrance on manual control, his hands moving across the interface with the practiced precision that came from thousands of hours of training. But his fingers felt numb, his reactions just slightly delayed, his entire body heavy with exhaustion that went bone-deep.

The docking computer had offered to take over the approach sequence. Miguel had declined. After nearly four hours strapped into this cockpit, fighting for his life and everyone else's, he wanted to land the fighter himself. Needed to.

The Talon settled onto its designated pad with a barely perceptible thump, magnetic clamps engaging, power systems automatically cycling down to standby. Miguel's hands stayed on the controls for a moment, not quite ready to let go, not quite ready to accept that it was really over.

Then he reached up and initiated the canopy release.

The seal broke with a hiss of equalizing pressure. The canopy rose, and Miguel was suddenly hit with the smell of the docking bay—coolant, hydraulic fluid, hot metal, the recycled air of a space station that had just spent hours under siege. It smelled real in a way that his cockpit's filtered atmosphere hadn't.

He pulled off his helmet, running a hand through sweat-soaked hair, and started the process of disconnecting from the Talon's systems. Umbilicals, data links, the restraint harness that had kept him locked in place through hours of high-G maneuvers. Each connection separated with mechanical clicks that sounded too normal, too mundane for what they'd just survived.

Miguel tried to stand and nearly fell.

His legs didn't want to work properly. Four hours in the cockpit, muscles tensed for combat, adrenaline draining away now that the threat was gone. He grabbed the cockpit edge for support, forcing his legs to remember how standing worked.

Around him, the docking bay was filling with Talons. Portuguese, American, Japanese, and Federation fighters settling onto their pads in sequence, cockpits opening, pilots extracting themselves with varying degrees of difficulty. Ground crews were already moving between the fighters, running diagnostics, checking for damage, beginning the process of refueling and rearming.

Miguel climbed down from his Talon's side, using the maintenance ladder, taking it one rung at a time. His flight suit was soaked through with sweat, uncomfortable against his skin, but that discomfort was distant, abstract. Everything felt distant right now.

He reached the deck and stood there for a moment, just breathing, trying to process that he was alive, that they'd won, that Earth was safe.

> "Freitas."

Miguel turned to see Captain Ramos approaching, the Delta Lead also looking like he'd just survived the longest four hours of his life. His flight suit was in the same state as Miguel's, his face showing the same exhaustion.

> "Sir."

> "You did good work out there. That first bomber kill probably saved the station."

Miguel managed a tired smile.

> "We all did good work, sir. We're still here."

Ramos nodded, then clapped Miguel on the shoulder.

> "Get yourself to the debriefing area. Medical check first, then they'll want to talk to us about what happened out there."

> "Yes, sir."

Ramos moved on to check on the rest of Delta Flight, leaving Miguel standing by his Talon. He looked up at the fighter, at the scorched paint where near-misses had stressed the shields, at the empty weapons hardpoints that had been cycling through ammunition for hours.

They'd done it. Twenty-five Portuguese Talons had launched from this station. Twenty-two had come back.

Three empty slots that would need to be filled.

Miguel turned away from his fighter and started walking toward the debriefing area, joining the flow of other pilots making the same journey. Around him, he could hear conversations in multiple languages—Portuguese, English, Japanese, and the Federation pilots speaking English with accents he couldn't quite place.

This was the first time Earth's nations had fought together in space. The first time they'd seen each other as allies rather than competitors.

And they'd won.

---

Major Ellie Morse climbed out of her Talon feeling like she'd just run a marathon in full combat gear. Her legs were shaky, her shoulders ached from hours of tension, and she was pretty sure she'd sweated through every layer of her flight suit.

But she was alive. Her squadron was alive. Most of them, anyway.

She pulled off her helmet and tucked it under one arm, scanning the docking bay for her pilots. The Vipers were scattered across several pads, their Talons showing the wear of extended combat—scorched paint, depleted weapons, the general look of fighters that had been pushed to their limits.

> "Major Morse!"

One of her pilots—Jenkins, she thought, though exhaustion was making names harder to recall—was waving from across the bay. She headed in that direction, weaving between ground crews and other pilots.

The American section of the docking bay was organized chaos. Twenty Talons had launched. Eighteen had returned. The two empty pads stood out like missing teeth, their magnetic clamps idle, their approach lights dark.

Morse tried not to think about the pilots who should have been landing on those pads.

She found most of her squadron clustered near the exit to the debriefing area, pilots helping each other out of their flight gear, comparing notes on the battle, the conversations carrying that particular quality of people who'd survived something they weren't sure they'd survive.

> "Everyone accounted for?" Morse asked as she approached.

Lieutenant Weber looked up from where he was helping another pilot with a stuck harness connection.

> "Eighteen present, ma'am. Patterson and Lee..."

He didn't finish. He didn't need to. They'd all seen the icons blink out on their tactical displays. Patterson had taken concentrated fire from two destroyers. Lee's Talon had suffered a catastrophic systems failure during a high-G maneuver and had broken apart before he could eject.

> "Understood," Morse said quietly. "Medical check, then debriefing. We'll do a proper memorial later."

The pilots nodded, the exhaustion on their faces mixing with grief that they were too tired to fully process yet. That would come later, when they had time to think, time to remember.

Morse looked around the docking bay, seeing the same scene repeated across different national sections. Pilots exhausted, relieved, grieving. Ground crews working efficiently despite their own exhaustion. The organized chaos of a military unit that had just survived combat.

Her eyes caught movement near the Japanese section of the bay, and she recognized the distinctive nose art of one of the Hell Ravens' Talons. The image was striking—a grinning anime girl with raven wings spreading from her back and what looked like a nuclear cannon mounted on her right arm. The character had a determined, almost manic expression that seemed both playful and fierce.

The pilot climbing down from that particular Talon moved with the same controlled exhaustion as everyone else, but there was something in her posture that suggested she was processing the experience differently. More internally. Less visible.

Major Tanaka Utsuho, Morse recalled from the pre-mission briefings. Call sign Okuu. The Hell Ravens' commander.

Morse started walking in that direction, picking her way through the organized chaos. They'd been fighting alongside each other for hours, coordinating attacks, covering each other's approaches, operating as a unified force despite never having trained together.

Seemed like they should at least meet face-to-face.

---

Okuu stood beside her Talon, one hand resting on the fuselage, looking up at the nose art that had become something of a signature for her fighter. The maintenance crew had done excellent work recreating the character from the game she'd referenced—Utsuho Reiuji from Touhou, nuclear-powered hell raven, grinning with fierce determination and armed with impossible firepower.

It had started as a joke during training. Her instructors had pointed out the similarity between her name and the character. The nose art had followed naturally. Now, looking at it after nearly four hours of combat, it felt appropriate in ways she hadn't expected.

She'd fought with nuclear-grade determination today. They all had.

> "That's distinctive artwork."

Okuu turned to find an American pilot approaching—the insignia on her flight suit marking her as a Major. Blonde hair pulled back in a regulation bun, face showing the same exhaustion everyone was feeling, but eyes alert and assessing.

> "Major Tanaka Utsuho," Okuu said, offering a slight bow that was more reflex than conscious decision. "Hell Ravens squadron leader."

> "Major Ellie Morse, Viper Squadron. US Air Force." Morse gestured toward the nose art. "I take it there's a story behind that?"

> "Video game character. Same name, appropriate symbolism." Okuu allowed herself a small smile. "Nuclear-powered, heavily armed, never gives up. Seemed fitting."

> "After today, I'd say that's accurate." Morse looked around the docking bay, at the pilots extracting themselves from cockpits, at the ground crews already working on battle damage assessment. "Hell of a first mission for Earth's squadrons."

> "Four hours of continuous combat," Okuu said quietly. "I've done longer training exercises, but nothing like that. Nothing where the stakes were..."

She trailed off. The stakes had been everything. Earth's survival. Billions of lives. The entire human species.

> "You know what this probably qualifies for?" Morse said, her voice carrying a note of dark humor. "Longest continuous combat operation award. Four hours straight in the cockpit, no breaks, constant engagement. That's got to be some kind of record."

Okuu considered that.

> "If they're keeping records."

> "Oh, they're definitely keeping records." Morse looked toward the Federation section of the bay, where pilots in slightly different flight suits were going through the same post-flight procedures. "This was historic. First time Earth fought together in space. First time we operated alongside the Federation in actual combat. First alien invasion of the Solar System."

She paused.

> "First time we won."

The two of them stood there for a moment, letting that sink in. They'd won. Against impossible odds, against a force that should have overwhelmed them, they'd held the line long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

> "The Federation pilots," Okuu said, watching the other section of the bay. "We should meet them properly. We've been fighting alongside them, but I don't think anyone's actually introduced themselves yet."

Morse followed her gaze.

> "You're right. We've been on the same tactical net for hours, but that's not the same as actually knowing the people you're fighting beside."

Okuu pushed away from her Talon, feeling the exhaustion in her legs but refusing to acknowledge it beyond recognition. They were tired. They'd earned that. But there would be time to collapse later.

> "Let's go introduce ourselves," she said. "Before debriefing pulls us in different directions."

Morse nodded, and the two of them started walking toward the Federation section of the docking bay, where pilots were finishing their own post-flight procedures. Around them, the docking bay continued its organized chaos—ground crews, medical personnel, officers coordinating the aftermath of a battle that had ended just minutes ago.

Behind them, Okuu's Talon sat on its pad, the grinning hell raven on its nose watching over the bay with fierce determination, nuclear cannon at the ready.

The battle was over.

But the story of what they'd accomplished together was just beginning.

---

The White House Situation Room had been in a state of controlled tension for the past eight hours.

President Donald Trump sat at the head of the table, flanked by his Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor. The Joint Chiefs of Staff occupied the remaining seats—Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Space Force, and Coast Guard. Each one had been monitoring the situation through carefully curated briefings, filtered intelligence reports, and the occasional update from defense satellites that had picked up anomalous energy signatures near Jupiter.

None of them had the full picture. They couldn't. The Federation had ensured that Earth's surveillance capabilities were sophisticated enough to detect that something was happening, but not sophisticated enough to understand what.

General Marcus Hayes, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, had been in this room for all eight hours. He'd watched the energy signatures flare and fade, watched the patterns that suggested massive weapons discharge, watched the data that told him a battle of unprecedented scale was happening in humanity's backyard.

And he'd been utterly unable to do anything about it.

The screens at the front of the Situation Room had been cycling through satellite feeds, sensor data, and intelligence assessments for hours. Now, suddenly, they went dark.

Then a familiar geometric form materialized on the main display.

HARBINGER.

The AI's avatar—a complex arrangement of rotating geometric shapes that somehow conveyed awareness and intelligence—pulsed a steady blue. When it spoke, its voice carried none of the urgency that had characterized previous communications. Just calm, measured certainty.

> "Mr. President, Joint Chiefs of Staff, I am pleased to report that the Ryzak invasion force has been completely destroyed. Sol is secure. The threat has been eliminated."

The room went silent.

Trump leaned forward, squinting at the screen.

> "So you're telling me we won? Against these... what did you call them?"

> "Ryzak, Mr. President. And yes. Federation forces, working in coordination with Earth's Talon squadrons from Portugal, the United States, and Japan, successfully defended Galileo Station and prevented the invasion force from reaching Earth."

> "Good, good. That's tremendous. So this is over? We can get back to normal?"

General Hayes felt something cold settle in his chest. The President didn't understand. He'd been briefed on the basics—alien threat, Federation response, Earth's limited involvement—but he clearly hadn't grasped the magnitude of what had just happened.

Admiral Sarah Chen, Chief of Naval Operations, spoke up carefully.

> "Mr. President, if I may. HARBINGER, can you provide details on the engagement? Force composition, casualties, threat assessment?"

HARBINGER's geometric form shifted, displaying data overlays.

> "The Ryzak deployed thirty-four vessels. Two carriers, four battleships, multiple cruisers and destroyers, with full fighter complement. Their objective was to eliminate Federation presence in Sol and establish orbital control over Earth."

General Raymond Torres, Air Force Chief of Staff, did the mental math immediately.

Thirty-four warships. Carriers plural. Battleships plural.

That wasn't a raid. That wasn't a probe. That was an invasion fleet designed to conquer a solar system.

> "And our losses?" Torres asked, his voice tight.

> "Earth forces deployed sixty-one Talon fighters across three national squadrons. We suffered twenty-seven fighter losses. Fifty-four pilots recovered, three killed in action."

Trump leaned back in his chair, nodding.

> "So we won with minimal casualties. That's excellent. Three losses out of sixty-one—that's what, five percent? Those are winning numbers. Great work by our pilots."

> "Mr. President," Hayes said carefully, "those numbers don't tell the full story. HARBINGER, what were Federation casualties?"

HARBINGER's display updated.

> "Initial Federation defense force consisted of four battleships and supporting elements. *Gallipoli* was destroyed with all hands—forty-seven crew members. *Vanguard*, *Sentinel*, and *Typhoon* sustained critical damage and withdrew with combined casualties of thirty-two killed, sixty-one wounded. Thirteen Federation Talon pilots killed in action. *Lord Cardigan* was deliberately crashed into a Ryzak carrier by her captain after full crew evacuation—no casualties from the collision itself, though Captain Shaw was lost with his ship. Total Federation personnel killed: two hundred and fourteen."

The room went completely silent.

Two hundred and fourteen Federation personnel. Versus three American pilots.

Hayes felt the weight of those numbers settle over the room like a shroud.

> "Two hundred and fourteen people," Admiral Chen said quietly. "People we've never met, from an organization most of the world doesn't know exists, who died defending Earth."

General Torres leaned back in his chair, processing.

> "And the *Lord Cardigan*'s captain. He evacuated his entire crew, then deliberately crashed his ship into an enemy carrier. That's... that's beyond any definition of duty I know."

A Federation battleship destroyed with all hands. Three more critically damaged. A captain who deliberately crashed his ship into an enemy carrier to prevent it from reaching Earth.

This hadn't been a minor skirmish. This had been a desperate defensive battle that humanity had come within minutes of losing.

> "How close?" General Hayes asked quietly. "How close did they come to Earth?"

> "The Ryzak fleet was never closer than Jupiter's orbit. Galileo Station's defensive perimeter held throughout the engagement. However, had the station fallen before Third North Fleet's arrival, the Ryzak would have had clear approach to Earth with overwhelming force."

> "And we couldn't have stopped them," Admiral Chen said, not a question.

> "Correct. Earth's current defensive capabilities would have been insufficient against a Ryzak battle fleet of this size."

General Hayes stood, moving to the display showing the engagement zone near Jupiter. The scale was almost incomprehensible—a battle fought over distances measured in thousands of kilometers, with weapons that could destroy cities, ships that massed more than aircraft carriers.

And Earth's only contribution had been sixty-one fighters flown by pilots who'd trained for less than two years.

> "So what you're telling us," Hayes said slowly, "is that an alien empire just attempted to invade our solar system with enough firepower to sterilize our planet. They were stopped by Federation forces that took catastrophic casualties. And the only reason Earth is still here is because a shadowy organization that's been operating in the background for decades just laid down over two hundred lives to protect us."

> "That is an accurate summary, General."

Hayes turned back to the President.

> "Sir, this changes everything. The American people—hell, the entire world—they need to know what just happened. Not the classified details, not the strategic implications, but the basic truth: we were almost invaded. We almost lost. And we only survived because the Federation was there."

Trump waved a hand dismissively.

> "Why do they need to know? It's over. We won. Telling people they were almost invaded will just cause panic. Stock market will crash. People will freak out. Better to keep this quiet, handle it behind the scenes."

> "With respect, Mr. President," General Torres interjected, "this can't be kept quiet. Three families just lost sons and daughters in combat. Fifty-four more pilots are returning from a battle that lasted eight hours. Portugal, Japan—they're coordinating with us on this. And the Federation has been operating in the shadows for decades. This is the moment where that changes."

General Kaitlyn Morrison, Marine Corps Commandant, leaned forward.

> "Sir, General Torres is right. This was the first time Earth fought together in space. The first time our nations operated as true allies against an existential threat. And the first time we proved we can contribute to our own defense, even if it's just with sixty-one fighters. That's a story of human courage and cooperation. That's a story that needs to be told."

Trump looked around the table, seeing the unanimous agreement from his military leadership. His National Security Advisor leaned in, whispering something Hayes couldn't hear. The President's expression shifted from dismissive to calculating.

> "You're saying I should address the nation about this? Tell them about the aliens, the battle, all of it?"

> "Not all of it," Hayes said carefully. "But the essentials. That Earth was threatened. That we defended ourselves, with Federation support. That the threat is neutralized. And that we're entering a new era where humanity is no longer alone in the universe, but we're also no longer helpless."

The President sat back in his chair, thinking. Hayes could see the wheels turning—political implications, public reaction, the historical weight of being the president who told the world about humanity's place in a hostile galaxy.

> "How do I sell this?" Trump asked, waving his hand dismissively. "Look, I get it—big battle, people died, very sad. But how do I make this sound like a victory and not a near-disaster? How do I make this work for us politically?"

General Morrison's jaw tightened visibly. Admiral Chen looked like she'd tasted something bitter.

> "Mr. President," Hayes said carefully, trying to keep his voice level, "with respect, this isn't about politics. This is about—"

> "Everything is about politics, General. That's how the world works." Trump leaned forward. "We've got an alien invasion that nobody knew about, a secret space force that's been operating without Congressional oversight, and three dead pilots whose families I'm guessing don't know why their kids aren't coming home. That's a lot of problems. But it's also an opportunity if we frame it right."

The Joint Chiefs exchanged glances. This wasn't what any of them had expected from this conversation.

> "Because it was a victory, sir," Admiral Chen said, her voice tight with controlled emotion. "A desperate one, but a victory nonetheless. Earth's pilots flew into combat against impossible odds and bought time for reinforcements. The Federation protected us. We protected ourselves. And now we're still here. That's the message: we faced the darkness, and we survived."

> "Right, right. I like that." Trump nodded. "'Faced the darkness, survived.' That's good. We can use that."

HARBINGER's avatar pulsed on the screen.

> "If I may offer perspective, Mr. President. The Ryzak chose Sol because they believed humanity was weak, isolated, and protected only by minimal Federation presence. They were wrong on all counts. Earth's response, while limited, was effective. Your pilots performed with distinction. And the Federation demonstrated that any threat to humanity will be met with overwhelming force. This is a story of deterrence as much as defense."

Trump nodded slowly, the political calculation becoming clearer.

> "So we tell the story: hostile aliens attacked, Earth and Federation forces fought them off together, threat is gone, and nobody better try that again. Make it clear we're not helpless, but also that we've got powerful friends. And I'm the president who led us through it."

The Joint Chiefs went rigid. General Hayes felt his jaw clench. Admiral Chen's eyes widened in disbelief. This wasn't just political opportunism anymore—this was claiming credit for sacrifices Trump had no part in.

Before anyone could respond, HARBINGER's avatar pulsed sharp red.

> "No, Mr. President."

The AI's voice carried an edge that no one in the room had heard before. Not the calm, measured tones of a helpful assistant. Something closer to steel.

Trump turned to the screen, surprised.

> "Excuse me?"

> "You did not lead Earth through this engagement, Mr. President. You observed. There is a difference."

The room went completely silent.

HARBINGER's geometric form shifted, displaying images as it spoke.

> "The United States Air Force trained Earth's pilots. Major General Patricia Coleman and her instructors spent eighteen months transforming sixty-one individuals from terrestrial aviators into space combat pilots. That training saved lives today."

An image appeared: the training facility, pilots in simulators, instructors reviewing tactical data.

> "Federation Commander Sarah Chen activated FLYCATCHER when conventional tactics failed. She made the decision to trap both allied and enemy forces in a gravity disruption field, knowing it would force a decisive engagement. Her decisiveness prevented the Ryzak from reaching Earth."

Another image: Galileo Station's command center, Chen floating at her station in zero gravity.

> "Captain James Morrison aboard *Typhoon* developed the tactical doctrine that allowed depleted Federation forces to survive the initial assault. His defensive matrix kept the carrier battle group intact long enough for Earth's squadrons to arrive."

The bridge of the *Typhoon*, Morrison coordinating defensive formations.

> "Captain Robert Shaw evacuated his entire crew from *Lord Cardigan*, then deliberately crashed his battleship into a Ryzak carrier, destroying both vessels and eliminating a critical enemy asset. He gave his life to protect Earth."

The *Lord Cardigan* emerging from warp space directly inside the *Worldbreaker*, both ships disintegrating in fusion fire.

> "Sixty-one pilots from three nations flew into combat knowing they were outnumbered and outgunned. They fought for eight hours, taking twenty-seven casualties, buying time until reinforcements could arrive. Their bravery held the line."

Talon squadrons in combat, weaving through Ryzak interceptors, missile trails crossing the void.

> "Two hundred and fourteen Federation personnel died defending Earth today. Three American pilots. Four Portuguese. Six Japanese. They paid in blood for humanity's survival."

The images faded, leaving only HARBINGER's geometric form, still pulsing that sharp red.

> "Those individuals led, Mr. President. Those individuals sacrificed. Those individuals earned Earth's continued freedom. You authorized Earth's participation in the defense, which was necessary and appropriate. But you did not lead this battle. The people who led are either dead, or exhausted from eight hours of continuous combat, or still cleaning Ryzak debris from Jupiter orbit. Give credit where it is due."

The silence in the Situation Room was absolute.

Trump stared at the screen, his expression cycling through surprise, anger, and something that might have been understanding. The Joint Chiefs sat frozen, watching the President of the United States receive a dressing-down from an artificial intelligence.

And none of them moved to intervene.

Finally, Trump nodded slowly.

> "Point taken."

HARBINGER's avatar shifted back to blue, the edge leaving its voice.

> "Thank you, Mr. President."

General Hayes cleared his throat carefully.

> "Sir, if we could return to the question of honoring the fallen. Three American pilots died today. Patterson, Lee, and Vasquez. Their families deserve recognition, even if we can't tell them the full truth yet. Portugal lost four pilots. Japan lost six. And the Federation lost two hundred and fourteen personnel. We need to coordinate how to properly honor these people."

Trump sat back down, some of the energy gone from his posture.

> "You're right. They deserve proper recognition." He paused, seeming to choose his words more carefully now. "Work with State Department on coordinating with Portugal and Japan. And with the Federation on how they want to handle their casualties. If there's going to be a public announcement, we do it together. All four of us. Make that clear."

> "Yes, sir," Hayes said.

Admiral Chen spoke up, her voice steady.

> "The nature of the mission makes public honors complicated, but we'll find a way. Classified ceremonies, if necessary. But these pilots, these crew members—they'll be recognized properly. That's our obligation."

> "And the survivors," General Torres added. "When they return, they'll need support. Debriefing, medical care, psychological support. Fifty-four pilots who just fought in the first space battle in human history—they're going to need help processing that."

Trump nodded.

> "Set it up. Whatever they need. And when they're ready, I'd like to meet with them. Not a photo op," he added, glancing at HARBINGER's avatar. "A proper meeting. Private, if that's what they prefer. They deserve that."

> "Understood, sir," Hayes said.

The President stood, and this time the Joint Chiefs stood with him, but the energy in the room was different. Humbled. Sobered.

> "Get my speechwriters working on the announcement. But make sure they understand—this isn't about me. It's about the people who fought and died today. That message needs to be clear."

He left, staff following, but quietly now, the earlier energy about approval ratings and messaging replaced with something more subdued.

When the door closed, the Joint Chiefs remained standing for a moment.

When the President was gone, General Hayes turned to the AI.

> "Thank you for keeping us alive."

HARBINGER's geometric form shifted to something that might have been acknowledgment.

> "Thank your pilots, General. They fought with courage that exceeded their experience. Earth should be proud of them."

The avatar faded, leaving the Joint Chiefs alone with their thoughts and the weight of eight hours that had nearly ended human civilization.

Outside the Situation Room, the world continued on, unaware that they'd just survived an extinction-level threat.

But that was about to change.

---

Galileo Station's gravity had come back online twenty minutes after the last Ryzak ship was destroyed.

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas felt the transition from zero-G to standard Earth gravity like a physical weight settling over his body. He'd been floating near the debriefing area when HARBINGER announced the FLYCATCHER system was being powered down and normal operations were resuming. The gentle pull downward had been almost comforting—a return to normalcy after hours of combat in microgravity.

Now he stood in what the Federation called a "hygiene facility" but what looked more like the most advanced shower system he'd ever seen. The water—actual water, not recycled moisture vapor—was hot, pressurized, and infinite. He'd been standing under the spray for ten minutes, letting it wash away the sweat and grime of nearly four hours in a cockpit, and he could have stayed for another ten.

But there were other pilots waiting, and his body was demanding food more than it was demanding cleanliness.

He dried off, changed into the clean flight suit the Federation had provided—same cut as his Portuguese Air Force uniform but in Federation gray with a temporary guest patch—and made his way toward the common canteen.

The station corridors were busy with activity. Federation personnel moving with purpose, ground crews hauling equipment, medical staff transporting wounded to the station's hospital section. But what struck Miguel most was how the Federation crew treated the Earth pilots. Not as visitors. Not as guests. As their own.

A Federation technician had stopped him earlier, asking if his Talon needed any specific maintenance beyond the standard post-combat inspection. A medical officer had insisted on checking him for combat stress, speaking Portuguese with a slight accent Miguel couldn't place. A logistics coordinator had made sure he knew where the rec facilities were, in case he needed to decompress.

They were treating Earth's pilots like fellow warriors who'd shared the same battle. Because that's exactly what they were.

The common canteen was larger than Miguel expected—easily capable of seating two hundred people. The space was divided into several sections: a serving area with what looked like multiple cuisine options, tables and chairs arranged in social clusters, and a recreation corner with screens showing what might have been news feeds or entertainment.

It was maybe a third full, and Miguel immediately recognized the mix of uniforms. Federation personnel in their gray and blue, Portuguese pilots in their guest flight suits, American pilots scattered across several tables, Japanese pilots clustered near the recreation corner.

And everyone was talking.

Miguel grabbed a tray and moved through the serving line, selecting items that looked familiar—something that might have been chicken, vegetables that were definitely recognizable, bread that smelled fresh. The Federation crew member manning the station nodded at him.

> "First time trying Federation standard rations?"

> "Yes. Any recommendations?"

> "The protein is synthesized but nutritionally complete. The vegetables are hydroponically grown here on the station. The bread is real wheat, imported from Earth. You'll be fine." She paused. "And thank you. For today. You saved a lot of lives."

Miguel didn't know what to say to that, so he just nodded and moved on.

He found Captain Ramos and the rest of Delta Flight at a table near the center of the room, already eating. Someone had found coffee—real coffee, not the recycled station substitute—and the smell alone was almost worth the entire battle.

> "Freitas. About time." Ramos gestured to an empty chair. "Food's actually good. Not sure what half of it is, but it's good."

Miguel sat, feeling the exhaustion hit him now that he was finally off his feet and had food in front of him. Around them, the conversations were picking up—tired voices, relieved laughter, the particular sound of people who'd survived something terrible and were slowly remembering how to be human again.

Two tables over, he could see Major Morse with some of her Viper Squadron, talking with a group of Federation pilots. One of them was demonstrating something with hand gestures—probably a combat maneuver, judging by the complexity. Morse was nodding along, asking questions, comparing tactics.

Near the recreation corner, Major Tanaka sat with her Hell Ravens, speaking Japanese with what looked like a Federation pilot who was responding in the same language. The conversation looked intense but friendly—probably comparing notes on the battle, sharing perspectives from different parts of the engagement.

A Federation pilot approached their table—late twenties, flight suit showing the wear of combat, captain's insignia on the collar.

> "Mind if I join you? All the Federation tables are full, and you guys looked like you had room."

> "Please," Ramos said, gesturing to an empty chair. "Captain Eduardo Ramos, Portuguese Air Force. Delta Lead."

> "Captain James Wright, Federation Aerospace Force. Third North Fleet, strike wing commander off *In Amber Clad*." He sat down with visible relief. "Hell of a first day in Sol."

> "You just got here with Third North Fleet?" Miguel asked.

> "Jumped in five hours ago, got immediately scrambled for combat operations, spent three hours hunting down Ryzak stragglers, and landed twenty minutes ago. Haven't even seen my quarters yet." Wright took a long drink of whatever he'd gotten from the serving line. "But I'll take that over what you guys went through. Eight hours of continuous combat against a fleet that size? With your level of training? That's insane."

> "It was necessary," Ramos said quietly.

> "It was more than necessary. It was extraordinary." Wright looked around the table, meeting each pilot's eyes. "You know what the tactical briefing said? That Earth pilots with less than two years of training held the line against Ryzak interceptors for over three hours. That you took out their entire bomber complement. That you bought enough time for Commander Chen to activate FLYCATCHER and trap the whole fleet. If you hadn't been here, that battle would have ended very differently."

Miguel felt something uncomfortable in his chest. They'd just done what they had to do. What else could they have done? Let the Ryzak reach Earth?

> "We had good instructors," he said.

> "And you had courage," Wright replied. "Don't sell yourselves short. The Federation's been fighting in space for decades. You've been training for eighteen months. The fact that you're sitting here, eating dinner, having this conversation—that's not luck. That's skill and bravery."

Before anyone could respond, the general conversation in the canteen began to quiet. Miguel looked up to see three figures entering from the main corridor.

Admiral Trager, the commander of Third North Fleet who'd brought nineteen warships to turn the tide. Commander Sarah Chen, who'd held Galileo Station together through eight hours of siege. And walking beside them, a holographic projection that had to be HARBINGER—the AI's geometric avatar floating at human height, pulsing a steady blue.

The canteen went silent as the three of them moved to the center of the room.

Admiral Trager spoke first, his voice carrying easily across the space.

> "I'm going to keep this brief because I know everyone here is exhausted. But before anyone goes to get some well-deserved rest, there are things that need to be said."

He looked around the room, making eye contact with pilots from every nation.

> "Eight hours ago, a Ryzak invasion fleet jumped into Sol with the explicit intention of destroying the Federation presence here and establishing orbital control over Earth. They came with overwhelming force. Two carriers, four battleships, full support elements. They expected to roll over whatever minimal defense we had and proceed directly to your homeworld."

The Admiral paused.

> "They were wrong. They were wrong because Federation crews fought with distinction despite being outnumbered and outgunned. They were wrong because Commander Chen made the tactically brilliant decision to activate FLYCATCHER and force a decisive engagement. They were wrong because Captain Shaw gave his life to take out one of their carriers. And they were wrong because sixty-one pilots from three Earth nations flew into combat against impossible odds and held the line."

He turned specifically toward the Earth pilots scattered across the canteen.

> "You. The Portuguese, American, and Japanese pilots who've been training for less than two years. You faced Ryzak interceptors piloted by warriors who'd been flying combat missions since before some of you were born. You went into battle knowing you were outnumbered, knowing you had less experience, knowing that the odds said you probably wouldn't be coming home."

Trager's voice grew stronger.

> "And you went anyway. You threw yourselves headlong into a battle none of you had any business winning. You flew for four hours straight, taking losses, watching your squadron mates die, and you never broke. You never ran. You held the line until we could get here with reinforcements. You saved your planet."

Commander Chen stepped forward.

> "The battle cost us. We lost *Gallipoli* with all hands. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* took critical damage. Thirteen Federation pilots didn't make it home. And thirteen of your pilots—three American, four Portuguese, six Japanese—gave their lives defending Earth."

Her voice was steady, but Miguel could hear the weight behind it.

> "Those losses matter. Every single one of them. And while we can't give them the recognition they deserve publicly—not yet—we can honor them here, among the people who fought beside them."

HARBINGER's avatar pulsed, and the AI's voice filled the canteen.

> "In twenty-four hours, after you've had time to rest and process what you've experienced, you will be provided transport back to Earth orbit. From there, you can use your Talons to return to your home bases. The Federation will handle all diplomatic coordination with your respective governments."

The holographic form shifted slightly.

> "Recovering the bodies of our fallen comrades from the combat zone is unlikely. The debris field spans thousands of kilometers, and many of the remains were lost when ships were destroyed. However, each squadron commander will be given commemorative statuettes for each fallen pilot. These will be crafted from metals that are precious on Earth—palladium, iridium, beryllium—and they will bear the name, rank, and nation of every pilot we lost today. You will present these to their families with our deepest respect."

Miguel felt his throat tighten. They couldn't recover the bodies. Patterson, Lee, Vasquez, the Portuguese and Japanese pilots who'd died—their families would never have graves to visit, never have closure. Just a statuette made of precious metals and the knowledge that their loved ones had died defending Earth.

HARBINGER continued.

> "Additionally, every pilot who participated in today's engagement will receive a commemorative coin. This is in keeping with human military tradition. The coin will acknowledge your participation in the Battle of Sol, and it will be recognized by the Federation as proof of your service. You've earned that recognition."

Admiral Trager stepped forward again.

> "You're all exhausted. You need food, rest, and time to process what you've been through. The station's facilities are open to you—hygiene, recreation, medical, whatever you need. Federation personnel have been instructed to treat you as our own, because that's what you are. You flew into combat alongside us, you bled alongside us, and some of you died alongside us. That makes you ours."

He looked around the room one more time.

> "Get some rest. Take care of each other. And know that what you did today will be remembered. Sol is safe because of you. Earth is safe because of you. The Federation is proud to call you allies."

The Admiral, Commander Chen, and HARBINGER's avatar left the canteen, leaving behind a room full of pilots who were trying to process everything they'd just heard.

Miguel looked down at his food, which had gone cold while he was listening. Around him, the conversations were starting back up, but quieter now. More thoughtful.

Captain Wright raised his cup—whatever he'd been drinking.

> "To the pilots we lost. Federation, Earth, all of them."

Around the canteen, cups and glasses raised.

> "To the pilots we lost."

Miguel raised his coffee, thinking about the three American pilots whose names HARBINGER had listed. Patterson, Lee, Vasquez. He hadn't known them. Hadn't flown with them. But they'd been out there in the same battle, fighting the same enemy, giving their lives for the same cause.

They were his comrades. His brothers and sisters in arms.

And they'd never be forgotten.

He drank, the coffee bitter and strong and real.

Around him, Galileo Station continued its work—damaged but functional, battered but unbroken. The Federation personnel moved with purpose, the Earth pilots slowly allowed themselves to relax, and somewhere in the Jupiter system, Third North Fleet maintained patrol, ensuring that no threat would reach Earth.

The battle was over.

But the bonds forged in combat—between nations, between pilots, between Earth and the Federation—those would last forever.
