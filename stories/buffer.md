## Chapter 6: Debrief

The approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport felt almost surreal after everything Marisa had experienced. Shade descended through normal airspace at normal speeds, following standard approach vectors like any other aircraft. The only difference was that air traffic control couldn't see them—their radar screens showing clear skies while a forty-meter spacecraft glided silently toward the runway.

> "Final approach, Runway Zero-One," Shade announced with the same clinical precision it had maintained throughout the flight. "Local time zero-six-thirty-seven. Weather is clear, winds light and variable."

Through the viewport, Marisa could see the Potomac River winding through the dawn landscape, the Washington Monument catching the early morning light. The city was waking up, traffic beginning to build on the highways, people starting another ordinary day completely unaware that two EMP devices had nearly turned San Francisco into a dead zone just hours earlier.

The landing was as gentle as the takeoff had been brutal twelve hours ago. Shade touched down on a service runway away from the main terminal, rolling to a stop near what looked like an abandoned maintenance hangar. The kind of place where aircraft came to be forgotten, not to discharge passengers who had just returned from preventing a catastrophic terrorist attack.

As the engines wound down, Marisa noticed that LeBouf and his team had changed clothes during the flight. Gone were the tactical vests, the combat gear, the obvious military hardware. Now they wore civilian clothing—khakis, polo shirts, light jackets that could have come from any department store. LeBouf himself had traded his operational kit for a navy blue windbreaker and dark slacks, looking every inch the unremarkable federal employee.

But there was something about the way the clothes fit that bothered Marisa. The jackets hung just slightly wrong, as if they were concealing more than they revealed. The fabric looked ordinary but moved in ways that suggested hidden reinforcement. Even the shoes—simple leather oxfords—seemed just a shade too substantial for their apparent purpose.

> "FBI team, we'll be taking separate vehicles back to headquarters," LeBouf said as the restraints retracted. "Standard procedure—we maintain operational security until the formal debrief is complete."

The cargo bay revealed the same two Q-cars they'd used in San Francisco—the silver Honda Accord and the dark blue Toyota Camry. No additional vehicles, no government fleet cars. Just the same unremarkable sedans that had carried them through the Mission District at impossible speeds, now looking every inch like the rental cars they were supposed to be.

Marisa and her team climbed back into the Honda while LeBouf's group took the Toyota. As they pulled away from the hangar, Marisa looked back to see Shade's ramp retracting, the craft beginning its transition back to invisibility. Within moments, there was nothing but empty tarmac and the faint smell of jet fuel in the air.

The drive through Washington morning traffic felt like stepping back into a different world. Normal cars driven by normal people heading to normal jobs, their biggest concerns probably centered around coffee and commute times. Marisa watched them through the Honda's windows—a woman in a Civic talking on her phone, a man in a pickup truck checking his reflection in the side mirror, teenagers in a beat-up Corolla laughing at something on someone's phone.

None of them knew how close the world had come to chaos. None of them would ever know.

The FBI's J. Edgar Hoover Building rose ahead of them, its brutalist concrete facade as imposing as ever in the morning light. Marisa had walked through those doors thousands of times, but today felt different. Today she was bringing back secrets that couldn't be written in any report, experiences that couldn't be shared with anyone who didn't already know.

They pulled into the underground garage, the Honda's ordinary appearance getting them through security without question. LeBouf's Toyota was already parked when they arrived, its occupants nowhere to be seen. Marisa suspected they were already inside, probably in a conference room she didn't know existed, preparing for a debriefing that would never appear on any official schedule.

> "Seventh floor," Hartfield said as they stepped into the elevator. "Assistant Director Reeves wants to see us immediately."

Marisa nodded, trying to prepare herself for what was coming. How do you brief your superior on a mission that officially never happened? How do you explain that you've just returned from space, that you've worked with an artificial intelligence that could have stepped out of science fiction, that you've witnessed capabilities that made the FBI's most advanced technologies look like stone tools?

The elevator climbed through the building's floors, each one representing layers of the federal law enforcement bureaucracy. But somewhere above or below or parallel to this official structure was another world entirely—the shadow realm where the EarthSpace Federation operated, where Q-cars masqueraded as rental sedans and spacecraft launched from parking lots in New Jersey.

Marisa caught herself studying LeBouf's reflection in the elevator's polished metal doors. Even in civilian clothes, there was something about his posture, his alertness, that marked him as different. And those clothes—she was becoming more convinced that they weren't as ordinary as they appeared. The way his jacket fell suggested weight distribution that didn't match simple cotton or wool. The seams were too precise, the cut too accommodating for someone who needed to move quickly and quietly.

What kind of technology was woven into fabric that looked like it came from a mall department store? What capabilities were hidden in plain sight, disguised as the mundane uniform of federal bureaucracy?

The elevator chimed softly as it reached the seventh floor, the doors sliding open to reveal the familiar corridors of FBI leadership. But as Marisa stepped out, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was crossing from one world into another—from the realm of impossible possibilities back into the comfortable illusion of normal government operations.

And somewhere in the space between those worlds, the real work of protecting the country continued, invisible and unacknowledged, carried out by people whose ordinary appearances concealed extraordinary capabilities.

## Epilogue: Threshold

The debriefing lasted three hours and covered almost nothing.

Marisa sat across from Assistant Director Reeves in Conference Room 7C, the same sterile space where a thousand other operational reviews had taken place. Hartfield was to her right, his posture perfect, his face carefully neutral. The transcript would show a textbook after-action report: subjects apprehended, devices secured, threat neutralized. Clean. Professional. Utterly mundane.

> "The tactical support provided by ESF was instrumental in the operation's success," Marisa heard herself saying. "Their intelligence capabilities allowed us to identify and interdict the threat before activation."

Reeves nodded, making notes on his tablet. He didn't ask how ESF had obtained their intelligence. Didn't question the timeline, the methodology, the impossible speed of the operation. He simply recorded her sanitized account and moved to the next item.

> "And the devices themselves? They've been secured?"

> "San Francisco Field Office has custody," Hartfield said. "Local PD assisted with the initial seizure. They're being processed through standard evidence protocols for destructive devices."

Which was true, as far as it went. The EMPs were real evidence in a real case. What the report wouldn't mention was how they'd been located—the spacecraft, the orbital surveillance, the AI that had guided them through San Francisco's streets. Those details would never appear in any official document.

The rest of the session followed the same pattern. Questions asked, answers given, both sides carefully avoiding the truths that mattered. Nobody mentioned spacecraft. Nobody discussed artificial intelligence or Q-cars that defied physics. Nobody acknowledged that federal agents had just returned from orbit after witnessing capabilities that shouldn't exist.

By 1300 hours, it was over. Reeves thanked them for their service, commended their professionalism, and dismissed them with the promise that commendations would be forthcoming. The whole thing had the choreographed quality of theater, a performance both sides agreed to maintain.

Marisa returned to her desk on the fifth floor, to the familiar landscape of paperwork and email and case files. Her coffee mug sat where she'd left it three days ago, a ring of dried liquid at the bottom. Her monitor displayed the same background image, the same desktop icons. Everything exactly as it had been.

Except she wasn't.

She tried to work. Pulled up case files, reviewed reports, responded to emails. But her mind kept drifting back to San Francisco, to the way Shade had punched through the atmosphere like it was nothing, to the calm precision of that genderless voice providing real-time intelligence from orbit. She found herself staring at her hands, remembering how they'd gripped the restraints during launch, how her whole body had felt the impossible acceleration.

How did you go back to filing reports after you'd seen Earth from space? How did you focus on database queries when you knew there were AI systems that could see through walls and track targets from orbit? How did you pretend the world was normal when you'd witnessed proof that everything you thought you knew about technology and capability was a comfortable lie?

By 1800 hours, the office had mostly emptied. Marisa sat alone at her desk, the evening light slanting through her window, and pulled out her phone. She stared at Alicia Monroe's contact information for a long moment before finally calling.

Monroe answered on the second ring.

> "Agent Comey. I've been expecting your call."

> "You were right," Marisa said quietly. "About everything."

A pause. Then Monroe's voice, softer now, carrying an edge of something Marisa couldn't quite identify. Not sympathy. Something more complicated.

> "I wish I could tell you it gets easier. But honestly? I don't know if it does."

> "How do you do it?" Marisa asked. "How do you go back to normal after seeing what they can do?"

Another pause, longer this time. When Monroe spoke again, her voice was careful, measured.

> "I can't really talk about my own work with them, Comey. You know how classification works. But I can tell you this: you don't go back. Not really." She sighed. "You just learn to live with knowing. With understanding that the world isn't what everyone thinks it is."

Marisa thought about that. About the impossible weight of knowledge that couldn't be shared, couldn't be discussed, couldn't be written down.

> "It feels like a lie," she said. "Sitting here, filing paperwork, when I know what I know."

> "It is a lie. But it's the lie everyone lives with." Monroe's voice carried a note of resignation. "Most people can't handle the truth, and frankly, they don't need to. They need to believe the world is knowable, controllable, bound by rules they understand. So we maintain that illusion. We let them sleep soundly."

> "We Are Watching," Marisa murmured, remembering the calling card that had started everything.

> "Exactly." Monroe paused. "Look, I wish I could give you better advice. Tell you how to process this, how to compartmentalize it. But I'm still figuring that out myself. All I know is that they're real, they're effective, and they exist for reasons we probably don't fully understand. And now you're one of the people who knows."

> "Lucky me."

> "Lucky all of us, maybe. Somebody has to know. Somebody has to be able to work with them when the situation requires it." Monroe's voice softened slightly. "Get some rest, Comey. And if you ever need to talk—within the limits of what we can discuss—call me. It helps, knowing there's someone else who understands."

After the call ended, Marisa sat in the gathering darkness of her office, watching the city lights come on across Washington. Somewhere out there, LeBouf had returned to whatever ESF facility he called home. Somewhere, Shade was probably already being prepped for another mission. Somewhere, the AI had returned to its mysterious duties, maintaining the invisible web that kept the world from tearing itself apart.

And here she was, back at her desk, surrounded by the comfortable mundanity of federal bureaucracy.

Monroe couldn't give her answers. Couldn't even talk about her own experiences. They were both operating in a world of compartmented knowledge, each carrying secrets the other couldn't know. But at least Monroe understood the weight of it. The isolation of knowing truths that couldn't be shared.

Marisa gathered her things and headed for the elevator. The building was quiet, most agents already gone for the evening. Her footsteps echoed in the empty corridors, a lonely sound that reminded her how isolated this knowledge made her. How few people could understand what she'd seen, what she now knew.

The elevator descended in silence. She watched the numbers count down, each floor taking her further from the classified world of the seventh floor, closer to the ordinary world of ground level. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

The doors opened onto the lobby. She badged out through security, exchanged nods with the evening guard, and stepped through the main entrance into the cool October evening.

The street was busy with end-of-day traffic. Pedestrians hurrying home, cars honking, the usual urban chaos of Washington at rush hour. Marisa paused on the steps, breathing in the city air, trying to ground herself in the familiar.

She turned left, heading toward the Metro station. The sidewalk was crowded, forcing her to weave between slower walkers. A woman in a business suit talking urgently on her phone. A man with a briefcase checking his watch. A delivery driver pushing a hand truck loaded with packages.

And there, moving through the crowd with unremarkable efficiency, was a face she recognized.

Jeane LeBouf.

He wore khakis and a polo shirt, a light jacket that could have come from any department store. His posture had the slight slouch of someone tired from a long day of office work. Everything about him radiated forgettable mediocrity—the kind of person your eyes would slide past without registering.

But Marisa registered him. Saw the too-precise way he moved through the crowd, never quite touching anyone but never slowing either. Saw the subtle awareness in his eyes, the way they tracked his surroundings with practiced efficiency. Saw the person beneath the unremarkable mask.

Their eyes met for a fraction of a second.

LeBouf's expression didn't change. No acknowledgment, no recognition. He simply continued walking, flowing past her in the crowd, disappearing into the urban river of humanity as if he'd never been there at all.

But Marisa had seen him. Had recognized him. And she understood now what that meant.

She would see them everywhere now. In crowded streets and quiet airports, in government buildings and shopping malls. The operatives of the EarthSpace Federation, moving through the world in plain sight, their unremarkable faces concealing extraordinary purpose. Always watching. Always ready. Always there.

Marisa continued toward the Metro, her steps steady, her face composed. To anyone watching, she was just another federal employee heading home after a long day. Tired. Ordinary. Unremarkable.

But inside, she carried the weight of impossible knowledge. The truth about spacecraft that launched from New Jersey. About AI that could see through walls and guide operations from orbit. About people who could do the impossible while looking utterly mundane.

She descended the escalator into the Metro station, letting the crowd flow around her, and wondered which world she truly inhabited now. The comfortable lie of normal federal law enforcement? Or the impossible truth of the Federation's shadow war?

The train arrived with its familiar rumble. Marisa stepped aboard, found a seat, and watched the city disappear into the tunnel darkness.

Somewhere above, the stars were hidden by light pollution and city haze. But she knew they were there. Knew that even now, Federation assets might be passing overhead, invisible and vigilant. Watching. Always watching.

The train rocked gently on its tracks, carrying her home through tunnels that felt somehow different now—not barriers against the world above, but merely one more layer of the elaborate illusion that most people called reality.

Marisa closed her eyes and thought about tomorrow. About returning to her desk, her cases, her paperwork. About pretending that everything was normal while carrying the weight of impossible truths.

Monroe had it right. You don't go back. You just learn to live with knowing.

The train rumbled on through the darkness, carrying her between worlds.
