## The Adults' Playground

They drifted in silence, four Talons hovering on the edge of the world.

Below, the curve of the Earth burned with blues and golds, oceans stitched to atmosphere in perfect silence. Above, the black was deeper than night. Stars hung like ancient sentinels, unblinking.

In the viewing gantries back at Vandenberg, a small Portuguese delegation observed with particular interest. Having received their own Talons nearly a year earlier, they watched the NATO pilots' orbital ascent with the quiet satisfaction of those who already knew what came next.

Inside their cockpits, the pilots still hadn't fully exhaled.

Kraus flexed his gloved hands slowly, verifying sensation. Lindholm sat utterly still, save for his eyes, which darted from orbit lines to shield readouts to the soft glow of the HUD. Adams was the first to speak, voice raspy in his helmet.

> "We're not in Kansas anymore."

> "You barely made it out of the driveway," Voss replied, his tone softer than usual.

He let the silence linger.

> "I brought you up here because I want you to understand what you're really training for," he said. "That figure-eight patrol back home? That's a *kindergarten loop*. This—" he nodded toward the horizon, "—this is where the *adults* play."

They didn't speak. They didn't need to.

Below them, the Pacific glinted like a molten coin under sunlight, and far to the north, faint auroras curled along the pole. Their Talons held perfect station with no effort—like they belonged here.

> "We'll be back in a few days," Voss said. "You'll do this again. For longer. Harder. With objectives."

> "Combat?" Lindholm asked, finally.

> "Eventually," Voss said. "But first, movement. Pressure. Coordination. It's different up here. You don't have drag, lift, terrain. You only have inertia, thrust, and timing. Get any of those wrong... and no one hears you die."

Adams exhaled through his teeth.

> "Hell of a view, though."

> "You get used to it," Voss said. "And then, eventually, you realize—this can be yours."

He didn't mean the Talon. He meant *space*.

> "The training manual doesn't talk about this," Kraus said, voice flat, but not unfeeling.

> "It doesn't need to," Voss replied. "The view does the talking."

And for a long moment, no one spoke.

They simply looked.

The descent was gentle—eerie in how little it felt like reentry.

The Talons bled altitude without drag, slipping back into atmosphere like shadows returning to a body. The transition to air-breathing mode occurred automatically at 67,000 feet, marked only by a low, tactile hum through the cockpit as the turbines spun back to life. Control systems dampened the shift, feeding velocity into a high-altitude glide until Vandenberg's coastline appeared beneath them.

They touched down just past sunset, wheels kissing the runway with barely a whisper. Four silhouettes. One formation.

By the time they'd peeled off flight suits and debriefed, the sky outside had turned purple, the last orange streaks dying over the ocean.

The mess hall buzzed like it never had.

They had a corner table again, but this time it wasn't quiet.

> "I thought my spine was going to *implode*," Adams said, gesturing wildly with a drink in one hand. "I've pulled high-G in the Raptor, I've done centrifuge tests at Wright-Patt, I've puked in VR. *None* of it even comes close."

> "It felt like we were being *launched*," Lindholm added. "Not climbing. Not accelerating. *Launched.* Like a round out of a gun."

> "There was no engine noise," Kraus said. "Just... force. I was expecting flame. Rumble. Not that *silent punch*."

Adams laughed.

> "Yeah, and then it just *kept going.* Like, I was waiting for a stall cue, for buffeting, *something*. Instead it felt like time just... warped."

> "That was the transition," Voss said, seated with them but not animated like the others. More like a man watching a campfire burn. "That shift to plasma engines—it's not just thrust. It's a shift in how the Talon thinks about the environment. No more atmosphere. No more drag curves. Just vectors. You want up? You get *up*. Instantly."

> "It wasn't just up," Lindholm said. "It was *off.* Like the Earth just let go."

> "And the dampers still didn't catch all of it," Adams added, rubbing the back of his neck. "I was ready to black out."

> "Same," said Lindholm. "And I think mine *did* for a second."

Kraus looked into his glass.

> "We weren't passengers. We were just... slightly tolerated guests."

They all laughed—harder than they usually did.

It was the kind of laughter that came not from comfort, but from awe. From brushing against something much larger than themselves and surviving to talk about it.

Voss let them have it.

They'd earned that much.
