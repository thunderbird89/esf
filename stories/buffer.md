## Chapter 5: Ascent

A slight wind kicked up across the parking lot, swirling debris and causing loose papers to scatter. Marisa felt it first—a change in air pressure, a subtle disturbance that made her ears pop. The sodium lights overhead flickered.

> "Look up," LeBouf said quietly.

Marisa tilted her head back. At first, she saw nothing but the orange-tinted night sky of industrial New Jersey. Then the air *shimmered*.

It started as a distortion, like heat haze on summer asphalt, but wrong—too precise, too geometric. The shimmer spread outward in a shape that shouldn't exist, revealing angular surfaces that caught the light in ways that made her eyes hurt to focus on. Black panels that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. Surfaces that shifted between matte and glossy as if the material itself couldn't decide what it was.

The craft materialized from nothing, settling toward the parking lot with impossible silence. No roar of engines. No downdraft from rotors. Just that gentle wind and the soft *hiss* of something moving through air that didn't want to move.

It was enormous. Fifty meters long at least, shaped like a flattened diamond or an arrowhead, all sharp angles and aggressive geometry. The nose was impossibly sharp, the body flowing back into wings that were too thin, too elegant, breaking every rule of aerodynamics Marisa had ever learned. The entire surface seemed to be made of those light-absorbing panels, broken only by subtle seams and what might have been sensor ports glowing with faint blue light.

The craft touched down on extended landing gear that looked too delicate to support its mass, settling with barely a whisper of contact. A ramp extended from the ventral surface with a soft hydraulic hiss, lowering to the parking lot asphalt. The interior beyond was lit with that same dim blue glow from the sensor ports.

Marisa stood frozen, her mind struggling to process what she was seeing. Beside her, Hartfield had gone pale, his hand unconsciously gripping his rifle tighter.

> "What the fuck," Rodriguez breathed.

LeBouf was already moving toward the craft, his two teammates flanking him. He called back over his shoulder, urgency cutting through his usual calm.

> "Hurry up and board. We have fifty-six minutes, and this is your ticket to San Francisco."

Marisa's feet moved before her brain fully engaged, training and desperation overriding the shock. Hartfield grabbed her arm.

> "Comey, that's not a plane. That's not any aircraft I've ever—"

> "I know," Marisa said, pulling free. "But it's also our only option. Move."

They ran toward the craft, Martinez and Rodriguez following. As they approached, Marisa could see the interior more clearly through the opening. Not a cargo bay or passenger compartment—something else. Seats that looked molded from the same angular material as the exterior, arranged in two rows facing each other. Restraint systems that were far more complex than standard five-point harnesses. Panels covered in what looked like medical equipment.

LeBouf waited at the entrance, literally bouncing on his toes with an energy that was completely at odds with his usual composed demeanor. The moment they were close enough, he started talking, words coming fast, his accent thick with stress.

> "This is Shade. The plane itself *is* Shade. It's an AI—artificial intelligence—fully autonomous. It will be taking us to space and back down to reach San Francisco in just over twenty minutes."

> "Space," Hartfield repeated flatly. "You're saying we're going to *space*."

> "Suborbital trajectory, yes." LeBouf was already climbing into the craft, gesturing for them to follow. "Get in, strap in immediately. We'll provide countermeasures—pressure suits, medications, monitoring—but blacking out is expected and normal. Your bodies are not designed for this kind of acceleration."

Marisa hauled herself through the opening, her hands finding purchase on surfaces that felt warm and almost organic. The interior was cramped despite the craft's size, every centimeter optimized for function. The seats—if they could be called that—were less like furniture and more like form-fitting cocoons.

The other two ESF operators were already strapped in, their visors down, moving with practiced efficiency. LeBouf was helping Martinez into one of the seats, his hands moving rapidly over the complex restraint system.

> "Arms here, legs here, head back against the rest. The system will conform to your body. Do not fight it. Shade will monitor your vitals and provide support as needed."

Marisa dropped into a seat, and immediately the material shifted, flowing around her limbs like liquid becoming solid. Restraints snaked across her chest, her thighs, her shoulders, locking into place with soft *clicks*. A panel extended from the headrest, curving around to position itself in front of her face—a helmet or mask of some kind, already sealing against her skin.

> "Wait—" she started, but the mask was already locked in place, and suddenly she could breathe easier, the air tasting pure and cold.

Shade's voice filled her ears, coming through the mask's integrated speakers with that same measured, genderless tone.

> "Agent Comey. Welcome aboard. Please remain calm. I am monitoring your vitals. Heart rate elevated but acceptable. Beginning pre-flight preparation."

Marisa looked around wildly. Hartfield was in the seat across from her, his eyes wide behind his own mask. Martinez and Rodriguez were further back, both looking terrified. LeBouf was the last to strap in, his movements hurried, almost frantic.

Hartfield's voice came through the comm system, muffled by his mask but clear.

> "LeBouf. Have you done this before? This... whatever this is?"

LeBouf's hands were still shaking as he finished securing his own restraints. When he spoke, his accent was so thick Marisa could barely understand him.

> "Yes. Many times."

> "Then why," Hartfield pressed, his voice tight, "do you look just as anxious as the rest of us?"

LeBouf's unremarkable face turned toward Hartfield, and for once, his expression was completely honest. Raw. Almost haunted.

> "Because you don't get used to it," he said quietly. "It just gets less bad each time."

The ramp retracted with a soft hydraulic hiss, sealing into the hull with a final, definitive *snap*. The interior lighting shifted from white to a dim red. Marisa felt the craft shudder—not mechanically, but as if it were a living thing preparing to move.

Shade's voice returned, calm and precise.

> "All personnel secured. Systems nominal. Filing emergency flight plan with FAA. Cloaking system active. Initiating launch sequence."

> "Wait—" Marisa tried to say, but her voice came out as barely a whisper.

> "Launch in five seconds," Shade announced. "Four. Three. Two. One."

> "Merde," LeBouf breathed.

The world disappeared.

---

It wasn't like takeoff. It wasn't like anything Marisa had ever experienced.

The acceleration hit like a physical blow, slamming her back into the seat with a force that emptied her lungs in a single, involuntary gasp. Her vision immediately tunneled, the red-lit interior collapsing to a pinpoint of light surrounded by darkness. The pressure wasn't just on her chest—it was everywhere, crushing down on every square inch of her body as if the air itself had turned solid.

She tried to breathe and couldn't. Her chest wouldn't expand. The mask pumped pure oxygen into her lungs, forcing air past the weight pressing down on her ribs, but it wasn't enough. Her heart hammered against the acceleration, struggling to push blood upward against gravity that had tripled, quadrupled, multiplied beyond anything human bodies were meant to endure.

Through the narrowing tunnel of her vision, she saw Hartfield. His face was distorted, skin pulled back against his skull by the g-forces, lips peeled away from his teeth in an involuntary grimace. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, bulging slightly from the pressure. He was trying to say something, but no sound came out—or if it did, Marisa couldn't hear it over the roar of blood in her ears.

Martinez was worse. The younger agent's head had lolled to one side despite the restraints, his face ashen, veins standing out in stark relief against his neck. His eyes had already rolled back, whites showing.

Across from her, LeBouf looked like he was dying. His jaw was clenched so tight she could see the muscles standing out like cables, his breathing coming in sharp, desperate gasps through his mask. But his eyes were open, focused, locked on something only he could see. This wasn't his first time, she realized. He knew exactly how bad it was going to get.

Shade's voice cut through the pressure, clinical and detached.

> "Maximum acceleration. Seven point four gravities. Duration: forty-two seconds. All vitals in acceptable ranges. Maintain position."

Seven point four gravities. Marisa's mind tried to process that and failed. She weighed—what?—a thousand pounds now? More? Her arms were pinned to the armrests, too heavy to lift. Her head pressed back into the headrest so hard she thought her skull might crack.

Then her veins caught fire.

It started in her arms, a sensation like ice water and molten metal injected simultaneously into her bloodstream. The pain was sharp, precise, spreading through her circulatory system in waves that she could feel moving from her extremities toward her core. Her neck, her chest, her legs—every major vessel suddenly burned and froze at once.

> "Administering vascular reinforcers," Shade announced, its voice still maddeningly calm. "Preventing stroke and maintaining cerebral perfusion. Discomfort is expected."

Discomfort. The word was so inadequate it would have been funny if Marisa had been capable of forming thoughts beyond the raw animal panic of her body shutting down. The sensation in her veins intensified, and she realized dimly that whatever chemicals Shade was pumping into her bloodstream were the only thing keeping her brain from hemorrhaging under the pressure.

The edges of her vision went from gray to black. She fought it, tried to stay conscious, but her body had other ideas. Blood was pooling in her lower extremities despite the reinforcers, draining from her brain despite Shade's interventions. The darkness spread inward, swallowing the red light, swallowing Hartfield's distorted face, swallowing the burning-freezing sensation in her veins, swallowing everything.

Her last coherent thought was of Rodriguez, who had stopped moving entirely.

Then nothing.

Outside the craft, invisible to anyone watching, something impossible was happening.

Shade rose from the parking lot on a pillar of blue-white fire, its external panels actively shifting to match the background sky and suppress any visible signature. The flames from its engines should have been visible for miles—a blazing column of plasma hot enough to vaporize asphalt—but the engine design dispersed and cooled the exhaust so efficiently that within meters of the nozzles, the thermal signature had dropped below detection thresholds.

The craft's ascent was nearly vertical, a column of invisible force punching upward through the atmosphere. It accelerated hard, pulling away from the ground with a violence that would have torn apart any conventional aircraft. The parking lot below showed no signs of disturbance—no scorch marks, no debris, nothing to indicate that a spacecraft had just launched from the middle of industrial New Jersey.

Within seconds, Shade had climbed through ten thousand feet, twenty thousand, the altimeter spinning upward in a blur. The air grew thinner, less resistant, and the craft accelerated harder, pressing its passengers deeper into their restraints. Thirty thousand feet. Forty thousand.

At fifty thousand feet, Shade punched through the altitude where conventional aircraft stopped climbing and kept going, its engines burning at full power, its trajectory flattening as it began the long arc that would take it to the edge of space and beyond. The stars became visible above, no longer twinkling but steady, brilliant points against the black.

Sixty thousand feet. Seventy thousand. The curvature of the Earth became visible now, the horizon bending, the sky above transitioning from deep blue to purple to black.

Shade's adaptive panels continued their work even as the air grew too thin to matter, the craft's angular surfaces now reflecting starlight and the faint glow of distant cities in patterns that made it impossible to resolve against the darkening sky.

Eighty thousand feet. Ninety thousand.

The engines throttled back slightly as Shade approached the apex of its boost phase, the acceleration easing from crushing to merely brutal. Inside, the passengers remained unconscious, their bodies limp in the restraints, their vitals monitored by dozens of sensors woven into the seats.

One hundred thousand feet. The boundary between atmosphere and space, crossed in less than a minute.

Shade's engines cut entirely, and the craft went ballistic, arcing upward on momentum alone. The sudden absence of acceleration would have been a relief, except none of the passengers were conscious to feel it.

Below, the eastern seaboard of the United States was visible in its entirety, a glowing network of cities against the dark curve of the Atlantic. Above, the stars burned with a clarity impossible to see from the ground, and the sun—still below the horizon for the surface—was beginning to paint the upper atmosphere with the first hints of dawn.

Shade coasted upward, silent and invisible, carrying its unconscious cargo toward the apex of its trajectory and the long fall toward California beyond.

---

Marisa woke to weightlessness and panic.

Her body was floating against the restraints, every instinct screaming that she was falling. Her stomach lurched, bile rising in her throat. The mask pumped cool air into her lungs, but it tasted wrong, felt wrong, everything was wrong—

> "Agent Comey. You are conscious. Please remain calm. We are in ballistic flight. Weightlessness is normal and expected. You are not falling."

Shade's voice cut through the panic like a knife through fog. Marisa forced her eyes open, forced herself to focus.

The cabin was still lit with that dim red glow, but now there was another light source—a viewport, or a screen, showing the view outside. And what she saw made her breath catch in her throat.

Earth. Not a picture, not a simulation. Earth itself, curving away below them, impossibly blue and white against the infinite black of space. She could see the entire East Coast from Virginia to Maine, see the Great Lakes glittering in the early morning sun, see the demarcation line between day and night cutting across the continent.

They were in *space*.

> "Holy shit," Hartfield breathed from across the cabin. His voice was hoarse, raw. "Holy *shit*."

Marisa looked around. Martinez was stirring, groaning softly. Rodriguez was still unconscious, his head lolled forward against his restraints, but she could see the gentle rise and fall of his chest.

LeBouf was awake, his eyes closed, his breathing measured. He'd clearly been conscious longer than the rest of them.

> "Welcome back," he said quietly, without opening his eyes. "We are at apogee. One hundred sixty-eight kilometers altitude. The view is spectacular, I am told, though I prefer not to look."

Marisa stared at the viewport, at the impossible curve of the Earth below, and felt something fundamental shift in her understanding of reality.

They were in space. They had launched from New Jersey. They were going to land in San Francisco.

And the FBI had no idea any of this was possible.
