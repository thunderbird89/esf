## Chapter 5: Revelation

### JSDF Emergency Operations Center, Ichigaya
### November 20, 2026 - 0930 hours JST

Private Naoko Yoshika sat at a metal table in a conference room that felt far too large for the occasion. The chair was uncomfortable. Her hands were folded in her lap to keep them from shaking. She'd slept perhaps three hours, showered, changed into a fresh uniform, and reported as ordered.

Across from her sat seven people who looked like they hadn't slept at all.

Major Tanaka occupied the center position, his expression carefully neutral. To his left sat Colonel Hayashi, the senior JSDF officer overseeing all Landmate operations in the Kanto region. To his right, General Kimura from Defense Ministry liaison. The others were civilians—two robotics professors from Tokyo University, a systems engineer who'd been part of the original Landmate evaluation team, and a woman in a dark suit who'd been introduced as being from the Cabinet Office but whose exact role Naoko didn't catch.

They'd been questioning her for forty minutes.

The table between them was covered with tablets showing freeze-frames from the viral video. Naoko could see herself from a dozen angles—pounding on Unit Six's chest, climbing into the cockpit, the Landmate's first uncertain movements. The footage had been viewed nearly eighty million times worldwide now. Someone had helpfully mentioned that number right before they started the debrief.

Colonel Hayashi scrolled through something on his tablet, then looked up at her.

> "Walk us through the harness sequence again. You said it activated automatically when you entered the cockpit?"

> "Yes sir. As soon as I swung my legs over the seat, the restraints started moving. Bands around my ankles first, then my legs, arms, torso. It happened very quickly. Maybe ten seconds total."

One of the professors—Dr. Yamamoto, the older one with gray hair—leaned forward.

> "Did you feel pain? Pressure? How tight were the restraints?"

> "Tight enough that I couldn't move, sir. But not painful. They... conformed to my limbs. Like they were measuring me." Naoko paused, trying to find the right words. "The pressure was constant but not uncomfortable. Like wearing a very tight wetsuit, maybe."

> "And the contact points on your head?"

> "Behind my ears, base of my neck, temples. Cold at first, then warm. They didn't hurt, but I could feel them. Mapping something, I think. Reading my movements."

The systems engineer, a man named Takahashi, was typing notes rapidly.

> "You said the interface activated immediately after the cockpit sealed. Describe what you saw."

Naoko had already described this twice, but she understood they needed to hear it again. Make sure her story stayed consistent. Make sure she wasn't making things up or hallucinating from stress.

> "The interior lit up. Not bright, just... ambient light everywhere. Then the view changed. Suddenly I was looking at the street from the Landmate's head, three meters up. My perspective shifted. I could still feel my body in the seat, but I could see through the machine's sensors."

> "How did you know how to move?"

> "I didn't, sir. Not at first. I tried moving my hand and the Landmate's hand moved. When I wanted to look around, the view followed my head movements. It felt... natural. Like the machine was reading my intentions and translating them into motion."

General Kimura, who'd been silent until now, set down his tablet.

> "Private Yoshika. You understand the seriousness of what you did. Unit Six represents technology we don't fully understand, provided by an organization we cannot contact. It is, by any measure, the most valuable piece of equipment in our inventory. Yet you climbed inside it without authorization, without training, without any way to know if you would survive the experience."

Naoko's throat felt dry. She nodded.

> "Yes sir. I understand that now."

> "So explain to us why you did it."

The question she'd been dreading. Naoko looked down at her hands, then back up at the panel. Seven sets of eyes watching her. Judging whether what she'd done was heroism or recklessness or something else entirely.

> "Sir, I'm not a large person. One hundred fifty centimeters tall. Barely fifty kilograms. When that aftershock hit and the building came down, when I heard people screaming for help..." She paused, organizing her thoughts. "I couldn't move the debris. I couldn't lift the concrete. I couldn't reach the people trapped underneath. I'm trained as an operator, but in that moment, operating meant nothing. I needed to be there, physically there, doing the work. And I couldn't."

She looked at Unit Six's image on one of the tablets. The machine that had amplified her will into something powerful enough to matter.

> "But inside the Landmate, I had the power to render real assistance. To actually help people, not just coordinate or give commands from a safe distance. My size didn't matter anymore. My strength didn't matter. The machine gave me the capability to do what needed to be done. To pull people from rubble. To lift concrete that would have taken a crane. To reach survivors that conventional rescue teams couldn't get to in time."

She met General Kimura's gaze directly.

> "I know what I did was unauthorized. I know I should have reported to my unit, waited for orders, followed protocol. But people were dying, sir. And for the first time in my career, I had the power to save them. So I did."

The room was silent for a long moment.

Major Tanaka was the first to speak, his voice quiet.

> "How many rescues, Yoshika? Over the course of the night."

> "I don't know, sir. I lost count after twenty sites. Thirty, maybe? The thermal signatures just kept appearing. I'd finish one extraction and move to the next."

> "The preliminary reports say you saved at least sixty people directly. Possibly more that we haven't confirmed yet. You operated continuously for four and a half hours, performing rescues that would have required specialized equipment and multiple teams."

Naoko didn't know how to respond to that. She stayed silent.

The woman from the Cabinet Office spoke for the first time, her voice measured and careful.

> "Private Yoshika, did you at any point feel that the Landmate was controlling you? Influencing your decisions? Overriding your intentions?"

> "No ma'am. If anything, it felt like the machine was waiting for me. Following my lead. It provided information—heat signatures, structural analysis, medical data—but the decisions were always mine. Where to go. What to lift. Who to extract first. The Landmate gave me the tools, but I directed how they were used."

Dr. Yamamoto was studying her intently.

> "You're describing a remarkably sophisticated interface. One that reads intention, provides feedback, amplifies human will while remaining subordinate to human judgment. That level of integration shouldn't be possible with technology we understand."

> "Sir, I only know what I experienced. I can't explain how it works."

> "No one can," the professor said quietly. "That's precisely the problem."

Colonel Hayashi picked up a different tablet, this one showing footage from rescue sites throughout the night. Unit Six lifting debris, bracing structures, performing extractions with precision that now made sense knowing someone was piloting it.

> "Private Yoshika, you've opened something we can't close. The video has been seen by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Every nation that accepted Landmates is now aware they can be piloted. The UN Initiative is meeting in emergency session this afternoon. And we still don't know if what you did was part of the Federation's design or if you somehow triggered a capability that was never meant to be activated."

He looked at her directly.

> "What you did may have been the most significant discovery about these machines since their arrival. Or it may have been the most dangerous mistake. We won't know which until we understand more. But either way, Private Yoshika, you've changed everything."

Naoko sat in the uncomfortable chair, surrounded by people trying to decide if she was a hero or a liability, and realized that she didn't have any answers. She'd climbed into a machine she didn't understand, operated technology decades beyond human capability, and saved dozens of lives in the process.

And now the world wanted to know what it meant.

She wasn't sure she could tell them.
