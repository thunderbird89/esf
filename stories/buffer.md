## Chapter 4: Weapons Free

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:53:22**

### Opening Salvo

The Ryzak battleship *Devourer's Pride* materialized first, its bulk emerging from the rippling distortion of the cyno bridge like a predator stepping through a curtain. Fifteen hundred meters of angular plating and weapons emplacements, its shields already raised, scanning arrays sweeping the space ahead.

It had three seconds of relative peace.

*Typhoon* opened fire from seventy kilometers, her primary railgun batteries cycling in perfect synchronization. Tungsten-carbide penetrators, each massing two tons and accelerated to a significant fraction of lightspeed, crossed the distance in heartbeats. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* followed a half-second later, their own batteries adding to the barrage.

The initial salvo hit like the fist of an angry god.

*Devourer's Pride*'s shields flared brilliant white, the defensive field dumping massive amounts of energy as it tried to dissipate the kinetic strikes. The first three rounds were absorbed, the fourth and fifth stressed the generators to their limits. The sixth punched through.

Armor plating deformed, then ruptured. Secondary explosions rippled along the battleship's port side as the penetrators carved through compartments, venting atmosphere and debris. Another salvo followed immediately—Federation doctrine emphasized overwhelming firepower in the opening exchange. More rounds hammered home, chewing through armor, collapsing bulkheads, shredding sensor arrays.

But the *Pride* didn't die.

Emergency systems kicked in, damage control crews scrambling, backup shields struggling to reinitialize. The battleship rolled, presenting its less-damaged starboard flank, its own weapons beginning to track targets even as alarms shrieked across its bridge.

Behind it, the cyno bridge continued to pulse, and more Ryzak vessels began to emerge—a heavy cruiser, then another, destroyers following in their wake. The formation spread out across a ten-kilometer radius from the beacon, ships orienting themselves, weapons coming online.

Then the carriers came through.

Two of them, bulky and angular, their launch bays already cycling open even as their shields initialized. They wasted no time. Strike craft began pouring out immediately—Ryzak interceptors, nimble and aggressive, dozens of them streaming into the black like angry hornets.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Sarah Reeves watched the tactical display with cold satisfaction.

> "All batteries, continuous fire. Target priority: battleship until it breaks, then heavy cruisers. Alert our Talons—enemy strike craft are launching."

The Federation fighters had been holding station in a wide perimeter around the beacon, engines on standby, waiting for exactly this moment. Now their pilots lit their drives, vectoring toward the emerging Ryzak formation. Forty-eight Talons, already in position, already armed, already hungry.

The response was immediate.

> "Talon Lead acknowledging. We have visual on enemy launch. Moving to intercept."

On the tactical display, the blue icons of the Talons began accelerating hard, closing the distance toward the red swarm of Ryzak interceptors. The enemy strike craft were spreading out, trying to establish combat spacing, but they'd launched directly into a hostile environment with Federation fighters already in advantageous positions.

Reeves allowed herself the ghost of a smile.

> "Helm, bring us to heading two-seven-zero, maintain range at sixty-five thousand. Weapons, I want that battleship crippled before their escorts can establish a proper screen."

The *Typhoon* rotated smoothly, her railgun batteries never ceasing their drumbeat of fire. The *Devourer's Pride* was fighting back now, its particle beams lancing out toward the Federation vessels, but its targeting was degraded, its fire control systems damaged. Most of its shots went wide, and the few that connected were absorbed by *Typhoon*'s shields with minimal stress.

The Ryzak had made a fundamental miscalculation. They'd assumed Sol would be undefended, that Earth's primitive civilization would fold under even a modest show of force.

They hadn't counted on running into a pre-positioned Federation battlegroup with its blood up and weapons hot.

> "Additional contacts," the sensor officer called out. "Frigate-class vessels, four of them. They're moving to screen the battleship."

> "Not fast enough," Reeves said quietly. "Weapons, shift secondary batteries to those frigates. I want them suppressed. Primary batteries stay on target."

The frigates were trying to interpose themselves, their own shields raised, point defense systems coming online. But they were too slow, too light, and the Federation had the initiative.

*Typhoon*'s secondary batteries spoke, lighter railguns and missile tubes engaging the screening vessels. The frigates' shields held for the first exchange, but the sustained fire began to tell. One frigate's shields collapsed entirely, and a follow-up missile strike tore through its engineering section, sending it tumbling out of formation, atmosphere streaming from ruptured hull sections.

The Talons were closing now, their pilots pushing their engines hard, weapons arming, target locks establishing. The tactical display showed them as a swarm of blue icons converging on the red mass of Ryzak interceptors still climbing away from their carriers.

It was about to get very loud.

---

The *Devourer's Pride* lasted another ninety seconds.

Its backup shields had managed to reinitialize, buying precious moments, but the sustained fire from three Federation battleships was relentless. Railgun rounds hammered into the same weakened sections, each impact driving deeper, carving through compromised armor. A penetrator found something critical—fuel lines, or maybe a magazine—and the battleship's midsection erupted in a cascading series of explosions.

The shields failed completely. The hull buckled, then broke, a section of superstructure shearing away in a spray of debris and frozen atmosphere. More explosions followed, marching along the spine of the ship like a string of firecrackers, and then the main reactor went.

The *Devourer's Pride* came apart in a brilliant flash, the bloom of the explosion briefly overwhelming sensors before the filters kicked in. Debris scattered outward in an expanding sphere, chunks of hull plating and equipment tumbling through space.

> "Target destroyed," the weapons officer reported, her voice professional and flat. "Shifting fire to secondary battleship, designate *Crimson Fang*."

> "Confirmed," Reeves said. "All batteries, engage."

But the Ryzak weren't sitting idle anymore. The rest of their formation had finished orienting, and now their weapons were coming to bear. Particle beams lanced out from heavy cruisers and destroyers, bright lines of ionized matter crossing the distance toward the Federation ships. The fire was scattered, uncoordinated—the Ryzak were firing individually, not as a unified formation—but there was a lot of it.

*Typhoon* shuddered as a beam caught her port shields, the defensive field flaring as it dissipated the energy. Another beam followed, then a third. The shields held, but Reeves could see the power draw climbing on her displays.

> "Shields holding at eighty-six percent," the tactical officer called out. "Rerouting power from secondary systems."

> "Evasive pattern delta," Reeves ordered. "Don't give them a stable target. Weapons, I want that second battleship's shields down in the next two minutes."

*Vanguard* and *Sentinel* were taking fire too, their shields flickering under the barrage. The Ryzak were throwing everything they had at the Federation ships, trying to create breathing room, trying to establish some kind of tactical coherence.

They weren't succeeding, but they were making it hurt.

---

The fighter engagement was a slaughter.

The Ryzak interceptors came in aggressive, burning hard toward the Federation line, their pilots clearly expecting to overwhelm the outnumbered Talons through sheer mass. They'd launched over a hundred craft from the two carriers, a swarm meant to sweep aside resistance and clear the way for their capital ships.

They ran headlong into forty-eight Talons flown by pilots who'd trained for exactly this scenario.

The first wave of Ryzak interceptors died in under thirty seconds.

Talon Lead—callsign "Reaper"—took his four-ship element straight into the teeth of the enemy formation, his wingmen spread wide, weapons already cycling. His targeting system locked on the lead Ryzak craft, a sleek angular frame pushing hard on its engines. Reaper waited until the range dropped to four thousand meters, then squeezed.

The plasma lance hit dead center, punching through the interceptor's shields like they weren't there and coring the craft in a single shot. It tumbled away, already breaking apart. Reaper's wingman splashed another, then another. The Ryzak formation wavered, pilots suddenly realizing they'd misjudged badly.

The Talons tore through them.

They moved with coordinated precision, elements working in pairs, each engagement lasting seconds. A Talon would roll onto a target, fire, and the target would cease to exist. The Ryzak pilots tried to respond, tried to bring their own weapons to bear, but they were outmatched in every metric—speed, maneuverability, firepower, targeting systems. Their shields couldn't handle the Talons' plasma lances. Their weapons couldn't track fast enough to get a solid lock.

> "Splash four," one of the Talon pilots called out, his voice calm despite the chaos. "Five. Engaging new targets."

> "I count sixteen down," another voice. "They're trying to regroup at bearing zero-three-five."

> "Copy. Third element, cut them off. Don't let them get organized."

The Ryzak were dying in droves, but they kept coming. More interceptors poured from the carriers, their pilots throwing themselves into the fight with desperate aggression. They were holding ground purely through numbers, replacing losses faster than the Talons could create them, trying to overwhelm the Federation fighters through sheer attrition.

It wasn't working, but it was buying time for their capital ships.

> "Talon Lead to *Typhoon*," Reaper's voice came through the tactical channel, slightly strained now. "We're chewing through them, but they're not breaking. Carrier launch tempo is steady. We're going to need to take out those launch bays or this goes all night."

Reeves glanced at the tactical display. The Talons had splashed nearly forty enemy interceptors already, but more were launching every few seconds. The carriers were protected by a screen of destroyers and frigates, their point defense active, shields raised.

Taking them out would mean pulling assets from the capital ship engagement.

> "Acknowledged, Talon Lead. Stand by."

She turned to her tactical officer.

> "How long until we can break the second battleship?"

> "Ninety seconds, maybe two minutes. Its shields are starting to fail."

Reeves made the calculation. Two minutes. The Talons could hold for two minutes.

> "Stay on target. Talon Lead, you have authorization to engage the carriers once we've neutralized *Crimson Fang*. Until then, keep them off our backs."

> "Roger that. We'll manage."

On the display, the dogfight continued, blue icons dancing through clouds of red, the enemy numbers slowly—too slowly—dwindling.

---

Then the situation changed.

> "Captain, we've got a problem," the tactical officer said sharply. "The second battleship's shield degradation rate just dropped. By half."

Reeves's eyes snapped to the power distribution overlay. The *Crimson Fang* had been losing shield integrity at a steady rate under the sustained barrage—the math was working, slowly grinding down its defenses. But now the curve had flattened dramatically.

> "Explain."

> "The carriers, ma'am. They're transferring power to the battleships. We're reading energy beams—looks like directed shield reinforcement protocols."

Reeves felt a cold weight settle in her stomach. She pulled up the extended tactical view. The two Ryzak carriers had moved into supporting positions, maintaining their screening elements but establishing direct line-of-sight to both battleships. Thin beams of energy connected them to the capital ships, barely visible on sensors but unmistakable in their effect.

The *Crimson Fang*'s shields weren't just holding. They were recovering.

> "Third battleship is receiving the same support," the sensor officer added. "Designate *Blood of Conquest*. Shield strength increasing."

Reeves ran the numbers in her head. Three Federation battleships against two Ryzak battleships being actively reinforced by two carriers, plus their screening elements. The Talons were keeping the interceptors contained, but they couldn't help with the capital ship engagement. And if this turned into a protracted slugfest, attrition would favor whoever had better logistics.

The Ryzak had just demonstrated they could outlast focused fire.

> "Increase fire rate on all batteries," Reeves ordered. "Engineering, I need more power to the primary guns. Strip it from life support if you have to."

> "Aye, ma'am. Capacitors charging."

*Typhoon* shuddered as another volley of Ryzak particle beams found their mark. The shields were holding at seventy-two percent, but that number was trending down. *Vanguard* reported similar status. *Sentinel* had taken a particularly nasty hit, one of her secondary batteries knocked offline, shields fluctuating.

They were winning, but not fast enough. And if the Ryzak established a proper defensive formation, if they managed to stabilize their line—

This could turn into exactly the kind of fight the Federation couldn't afford.

> "Ma'am, new contact," the sensor officer called out suddenly. "Small craft, moving fast. Bearing two-nine-five, closing on *Crimson Fang*."

> "Identify."

> "It's... that's a Wraith, ma'am. Transponder confirms it's one of ours."

Reeves pulled up the track. The Wraith was moving at suicidal speed, threading through the debris field from the destroyed *Devourer's Pride*, using the wreckage as cover. Its stealth systems were active—the Ryzak sensors probably hadn't even seen it yet. The craft was on a direct intercept course with the *Crimson Fang*, vectoring toward the battleship's flank.

> "What the hell are they doing?" the tactical officer muttered.

The Wraith didn't answer. It just kept coming, adjusting course with micro-burns, closing the distance. Five thousand meters. Three thousand. One thousand.

Then it fired.

A single plasma lance, perfectly aimed, punched through a section of weakened armor near one of the battleship's airlocks. The beam carved a hole clean through the hull plating, the edges glowing white-hot. Atmosphere vented immediately, a plume of frozen vapor streaming into space.

The Wraith didn't slow down. It dove straight into the breach.

> "They're boarding," the sensor officer said, her voice incredulous. "They just punched through the hull and boarded a battleship in the middle of a firefight."

Reeves stared at the tactical display, watching the Wraith's transponder disappear inside the *Crimson Fang*'s hull. A moment later, proximity sensors registered movement—armored figures, small arms fire, localized energy discharges.

A boarding team. Fighting their way through the ship.

> "Mark their position," Reeves ordered. "Adjust fire pattern—I want sustained pressure on that battleship, but avoid hitting anything near the boarding team's location. Let's see if they can create some chaos in there."

On the display, the tiny cluster of blue icons representing the boarding team pushed deeper into the ship, moving fast, weapons hot. They were heading toward something—a specific objective.

Whatever they were after, they were committed now.

And the Ryzak still hadn't realized they were there.

### Hostile Takeover

Lieutenant Marcus Jameson's powered armor had taken three hits getting to the console. His HUD showed shield integrity at forty-two percent, and one of his shoulder actuators was responding sluggishly. Behind him, his team held the corridor, plasma rifles crackling as they kept the Ryzak security teams pinned down.

The console was still active, its alien interface glowing with incomprehensible script and holographic displays. Jameson didn't waste time trying to read it. He pulled the ICE-Pick from his belt—a cylindrical device about the size of a flashlight, its surface covered in Federation tech—and stabbed it hard into the glass surface.

The console flickered. Then died. Then came back to life, the alien symbols crawling across the screen like they were trying to escape.

> "CIPHER!" Jameson shouted into his comms.

The AI's response was immediate, its voice calm and precise despite the chaos.

> "Connected. Subverting systems—please stay near the device. Fire control accessed. HARBINGER, connect through me."

There was a moment of silence. Then another voice filled the channel, deeper, resonant, carrying an edge of something that might have been satisfaction.

> "*ASSUMING CONTROL.*"

The console went dark for half a second. When it came back up, the alien script was gone, replaced by a humanoid face rendered in wireframe, its eyes glowing a cold blue. The face tilted slightly, as if examining something beyond the screen.

> "Fire control subverted," HARBINGER reported. "Target designation: Ryzak carrier, port side. Engaging."

Jameson felt the deck shudder beneath his feet. Not from incoming fire—this was something else. The *Crimson Fang*'s own weapons, cycling up, reorienting.

Firing.

---

Aboard *Typhoon*, the tactical officer's voice cracked with surprise.

> "Ma'am! The second battleship—it just fired on one of its own carriers!"

Reeves leaned forward, watching the display. The *Crimson Fang*'s primary batteries had rotated with sudden, mechanical precision, tracking one of the Ryzak carriers that had been providing shield support. The battleship's particle beams lanced out, brilliant lines of energy crossing the short distance between the two vessels.

The carrier's shields flared, then buckled under the sustained fire. The *Crimson Fang* wasn't pulling its punches—it was firing at full power, every weapon that could bear hammering into the carrier's defensive fields.

> "Boarding team reports they've accessed fire control," the communications officer said. "HARBINGER is in command of the battleship's weapons."

Reeves allowed herself a brief smile.

> "Well. That's one way to even the odds."

The carrier was trying to maneuver, trying to break line-of-sight, but it was hampered by its own screening elements. The destroyers and frigates that had been protecting it were now in the way, blocking escape vectors. The *Crimson Fang*'s guns kept firing, methodical and relentless.

The carrier's shields failed.

Immediately, the battleship's fire shifted to direct hull strikes. Armor plating buckled, then ruptured. Secondary explosions rippled along the carrier's flank as magazines cooked off. The vessel was still launching interceptors, but now half its launch bays were venting atmosphere, fighters tumbling out of control into space.

> "Carrier is critically damaged," the sensor officer reported. "Still operational, but it's lost shield projection capability. And its launch tempo just dropped by sixty percent."

> "Good," Reeves said. "Maintain fire on the third battleship. Let HARBINGER keep the second one busy."

On the tactical display, the situation was shifting. The *Crimson Fang* was now a blue icon instead of red, its weapons designation changed to FRIENDLY. It continued to pour fire into the crippled carrier, its particle beams carving through the damaged vessel with mechanical efficiency.

The Ryzak formation was in chaos. They'd lost one battleship entirely, another was compromised and actively shooting at them, and one of their carriers was burning. Their shield support network had collapsed. The screening elements were trying to reorient, trying to figure out what the hell had just happened, but they were too slow, too confused.

The Federation had just turned one of their capital ships into a weapon against them.

And the Ryzak were learning, too late, what it meant to fight an enemy that could subvert your own systems in the middle of a battle.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:31:45**

### Reinforcements Arrive

The warp signature appeared first—a ripple in space-time that made sensors scream warnings for half a second before resolving into something solid. Then the battleship *Gallipoli* dropped out of warp seventy kilometers from the beacon, her massive bulk bleeding off velocity with thruster burns that lit up the tactical display.

She didn't slow down to orient. She didn't wait to establish proper firing solutions. She just opened up.

Both railgun arrays—port and starboard—spoke in perfect synchronization, the salvaged fire control systems from *Lord Cardigan* proving their worth. Tungsten-carbide penetrators screamed across the distance toward the third Ryzak battleship, *Blood of Conquest*, which was still trading fire with *Vanguard* and trying to maneuver away from the chaos of the compromised *Crimson Fang*.

The first salvo caught *Blood of Conquest* mid-turn, her shields already stressed from sustained fire. Four rounds punched through the weakened defensive field, slamming into her port quarter. Armor buckled. Plating deformed. The impacts sent the battleship into a slow, uncontrolled roll as attitude thrusters struggled to compensate.

> "Direct hits," *Gallipoli*'s tactical officer reported over the command net. "Target's shields failing in sectors four through seven. Reloading—firing again."

The second salvo followed eight seconds later, this time aimed at the weakened sections. The fire control was perfect, each round tracking to impact the same compromised areas. More armor failed, more internal systems ruptured. Then *Gallipoli*'s missile tubes spoke, launching a full broadside spread of torpedoes—*Lord Cardigan*'s entire stock, now loaded into *Gallipoli*'s tubes.

Twelve torpedoes, each carrying shaped-charge warheads designed to punch through capital ship armor, streaked across the void. *Blood of Conquest*'s point defense came alive, trying to intercept, but the screening fire was degraded, its targeting systems damaged. Eight torpedoes made it through.

The battleship's midsection erupted in a cascading series of explosions, internal bulkheads failing, compartments venting. The ship's power signature flickered, its shields dropped entirely for three seconds, then struggled back to partial strength. It was still fighting, still firing, but it was hurt badly.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Reeves watched the tactical display update with grim satisfaction.

> "*Gallipoli* is engaging. Effective fire on the third battleship. *Vanguard*, coordinate with *Gallipoli*—I want that target neutralized."

> "Acknowledged," came the response from *Vanguard*'s captain. "Shifting fire now."

Two Federation battleships focusing on one Ryzak capital ship. The math was suddenly much more favorable.

---

Then *Lord Cardigan* arrived.

She came out of warp at a different vector, her civilian shield generators glowing faintly blue as they struggled to stabilize after the transition. She was uglier than *Gallipoli*, her hull showing the stress of emergency installation work, power conduits visible where armor plating should have covered them. But she was operational, and she was angry.

Her target wasn't a battleship. It was the second Ryzak carrier—the one that *Crimson Fang* hadn't managed to cripple, the one still launching interceptors at a steady tempo, still screening with its escorts.

*Lord Cardigan*'s main batteries opened fire, but these weren't the precise, computer-guided shots that *Gallipoli* and *Typhoon* could deliver. These were manual shots, aimed by gunners using iron sights and instinct, calculating vectors and deflection angles in their heads or with slide rules while the ship maneuvered beneath them.

The first volley scattered wide. One round came within two hundred meters of the carrier's shields. Two more missed by half a kilometer. The fourth somehow managed to clip a destroyer that had wandered into the line of fire, its shields flaring as the round skipped off at an angle.

But the gunners were learning fast, adjusting, compensating. The second volley was tighter. One round actually impacted the carrier's shields dead-on, the defensive field flaring brilliant white as it absorbed the kinetic energy. Another round followed, then a third. The impacts were random, unpredictable, impossible for the carrier's tactical computer to model because there was no pattern to predict. Just human eyes and human judgment, throwing steel at a target and seeing what stuck.

The carrier's shields were taking damage—not catastrophic damage, just steady wear, each impact draining power reserves, each hit forcing the generators to work harder. *Lord Cardigan* wasn't going to kill the carrier quickly. She might not kill it at all.

But she was making it hurt, and more importantly, she was making it deal with her. The carrier had to maneuver, had to direct point defense to intercept incoming rounds, had to allocate shield power to the sectors being hit. It couldn't ignore *Lord Cardigan*, even though the battleship's fire was wildly inaccurate.

> "*Lord Cardigan* is engaging the second carrier," Reeves's tactical officer reported. "Accuracy is... poor, ma'am. Maybe fifteen percent hit rate. But she's getting their attention."

> "That's all we need," Reeves said. "Every second that carrier spends worrying about *Cardigan* is a second it's not projecting shields to their battleships or coordinating their fighters."

On the display, *Lord Cardigan* continued her harassment fire, her jury-rigged civilian shields holding steady despite return fire from the carrier's screening elements. A destroyer tried to interpose itself, and one of *Cardigan*'s wild shots actually caught it amidships, the shield failure catastrophic enough to send the destroyer tumbling out of formation trailing debris.

Pure luck. But the Ryzak didn't know that.

The tactical situation was shifting minute by minute. The Ryzak had started with four battleships and two carriers. Now they had one battleship destroyed, one compromised and actively shooting at them, one taking concentrated fire from two Federation battleships, and one of their carriers crippled while the other was being harassed by a jury-rigged mess of a ship that somehow refused to die.

The numbers were still against the Federation. The Ryzak still had overwhelming force in their destroyers, frigates, and cruisers. Their interceptors were still swarming, still pressuring the Talons.

But the momentum had shifted.

And for the first time since the battle started, it wasn't clear the Ryzak were going to win.
