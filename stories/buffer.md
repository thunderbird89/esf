## Chapter 4: Weapons Free

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:53:22**

### Opening Salvo

The Ryzak battleship *Devourer's Pride* materialized first, its bulk emerging from the rippling distortion of the cyno bridge like a predator stepping through a curtain. Fifteen hundred meters of angular plating and weapons emplacements, its shields already raised, scanning arrays sweeping the space ahead.

It had three seconds of relative peace.

*Typhoon* opened fire from seventy kilometers, her primary railgun batteries cycling in perfect synchronization. Tungsten-carbide penetrators, each massing two tons and accelerated to a significant fraction of lightspeed, crossed the distance in heartbeats. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* followed a half-second later, their own batteries adding to the barrage.

The initial salvo hit like the fist of an angry god.

*Devourer's Pride*'s shields flared brilliant white, the defensive field dumping massive amounts of energy as it tried to dissipate the kinetic strikes. The first three rounds were absorbed, the fourth and fifth stressed the generators to their limits. The sixth punched through.

Armor plating deformed, then ruptured. Secondary explosions rippled along the battleship's port side as the penetrators carved through compartments, venting atmosphere and debris. Another salvo followed immediately—Federation doctrine emphasized overwhelming firepower in the opening exchange. More rounds hammered home, chewing through armor, collapsing bulkheads, shredding sensor arrays.

But the *Pride* didn't die.

Emergency systems kicked in, damage control crews scrambling, backup shields struggling to reinitialize. The battleship rolled, presenting its less-damaged starboard flank, its own weapons beginning to track targets even as alarms shrieked across its bridge.

Behind it, the cyno bridge continued to pulse, and more Ryzak vessels began to emerge—a heavy cruiser, then another, destroyers following in their wake. The formation spread out across a ten-kilometer radius from the beacon, ships orienting themselves, weapons coming online.

Then the carriers came through.

Two of them, bulky and angular, their launch bays already cycling open even as their shields initialized. They wasted no time. Strike craft began pouring out immediately—Ryzak interceptors, nimble and aggressive, dozens of them streaming into the black like angry hornets.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Sarah Reeves watched the tactical display with cold satisfaction.

> "All batteries, continuous fire. Target priority: battleship until it breaks, then heavy cruisers. Alert our Talons—enemy strike craft are launching."

The Federation fighters had been holding station in a wide perimeter around the beacon, engines on standby, waiting for exactly this moment. Now their pilots lit their drives, vectoring toward the emerging Ryzak formation. Forty-eight Talons, already in position, already armed, already hungry.

The response was immediate.

> "Talon Lead acknowledging. We have visual on enemy launch. Moving to intercept."

On the tactical display, the blue icons of the Talons began accelerating hard, closing the distance toward the red swarm of Ryzak interceptors. The enemy strike craft were spreading out, trying to establish combat spacing, but they'd launched directly into a hostile environment with Federation fighters already in advantageous positions.

Reeves allowed herself the ghost of a smile.

> "Helm, bring us to heading two-seven-zero, maintain range at sixty-five thousand. Weapons, I want that battleship crippled before their escorts can establish a proper screen."

The *Typhoon* rotated smoothly, her railgun batteries never ceasing their drumbeat of fire. The *Devourer's Pride* was fighting back now, its particle beams lancing out toward the Federation vessels, but its targeting was degraded, its fire control systems damaged. Most of its shots went wide, and the few that connected were absorbed by *Typhoon*'s shields with minimal stress.

The Ryzak had made a fundamental miscalculation. They'd assumed Sol would be undefended, that Earth's primitive civilization would fold under even a modest show of force.

They hadn't counted on running into a pre-positioned Federation battlegroup with its blood up and weapons hot.

> "Additional contacts," the sensor officer called out. "Frigate-class vessels, four of them. They're moving to screen the battleship."

> "Not fast enough," Reeves said quietly. "Weapons, shift secondary batteries to those frigates. I want them suppressed. Primary batteries stay on target."

The frigates were trying to interpose themselves, their own shields raised, point defense systems coming online. But they were too slow, too light, and the Federation had the initiative.

*Typhoon*'s secondary batteries spoke, lighter railguns and missile tubes engaging the screening vessels. The frigates' shields held for the first exchange, but the sustained fire began to tell. One frigate's shields collapsed entirely, and a follow-up missile strike tore through its engineering section, sending it tumbling out of formation, atmosphere streaming from ruptured hull sections.

The Talons were closing now, their pilots pushing their engines hard, weapons arming, target locks establishing. The tactical display showed them as a swarm of blue icons converging on the red mass of Ryzak interceptors still climbing away from their carriers.

It was about to get very loud.
