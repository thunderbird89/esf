## Chapter 4: Disaster

### Tokyo Metropolitan Area
### November 18, 2026 - 1323 hours JST

Private Naoko Yoshika was reviewing training protocols when the floor began to move.

Not the gentle sway that Tokyo residents learned to ignore. This was different. The building lurched sideways, throwing her against her desk. Coffee mugs crashed to the floor. The overhead lights swung wildly on their fixtures. Someone screamed. The emergency alarms started blaring, adding their wail to the chorus of creaking steel and shattering glass.

Naoko grabbed the desk edge as the world tilted again. Earthquake drills had trained her for this—get to a doorway, protect your head, wait for it to stop. But this wasn't stopping. The shaking intensified, a deep rumbling that seemed to come from the earth itself.

Through the window, she could see buildings swaying across the street. One of the older structures was already showing cracks in its façade. Car alarms wailed in harmony with the emergency sirens. The sky had that strange, dusty quality that came from concrete and mortar being pulverized.

The shaking lasted ninety seconds. It felt like hours.

When it finally stopped, Naoko's ears rang in the sudden relative silence. Around her, the depot office was chaos—overturned furniture, shattered screens, papers strewn across the floor. But the building had held. The JSDF built to earthquake standards.

Major Tanaka's voice cut through the confusion, calm and commanding.

> "Status report. Everyone check in."

Voices called out. Some shaken, but everyone accounted for. No injuries beyond cuts and bruises.

Naoko's phone buzzed with an emergency alert. She pulled it from her pocket, hands still trembling slightly.

**MAGNITUDE 7.8 EARTHQUAKE**
**EPICENTER: TOKYO BAY**
**TSUNAMI WARNING IN EFFECT**

Her stomach dropped. Magnitude 7.8. In the bay. The coastal areas—

> "All personnel, listen up," Major Tanaka called out. "This is what we've been training for. Yoshika, Sato, Kimura—get to the hangar. We're mobilizing the Landmates."

Naoko was already moving before the order fully registered. Seven weeks. Seven weeks since the Landmates had arrived. Four weeks since the Initiative training had begun. They'd drilled for this, practiced the commands, rehearsed the deployment procedures.

But this wasn't a drill.

The depot yard was a mess of fallen equipment and cracked pavement, but the Landmates stood in their perfect formation, utterly unmoved by the earthquake that had shaken everything around them. Naoko felt a surge of something—relief? gratitude?—at the sight of those ten motionless figures.

> "Landmate units," Major Tanaka's voice carried across the yard. "Board the transport helicopters on approach. Move to the marked positions."

The Landmates moved in unison, their stride eating up ground with mechanical precision. Naoko could already hear the helicopters—three heavy cargo Chinooks coming in fast and low, their rotors beating the air.

The loading procedure they'd practiced dozens of times unfolded with smooth efficiency. Three Landmates per helicopter, walking up the rear ramps without hesitation. One unit remaining at the depot for local operations. The machines weighed tons, but the cargo helicopters were rated for them.

Naoko grabbed her gear and ran for the command vehicle. Through her radio, she could hear the emergency channels lighting up. Reports flooding in from across Tokyo. Building collapses in Shinagawa. Fires in Odaiba. The elevated expressway near Ariake had buckled. The Sumida River bridges—

She forced herself to focus. Her job was the Landmates. Get them to the disaster zone. Keep them working. Save as many people as possible.

The command vehicle lurched into motion, following the helicopters toward the smoke rising over Tokyo Bay.

### Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 1445 hours JST

The Ariake district looked like something from a war zone.

Naoko had seen earthquake damage before—cracked walls, broken windows, collapsed roofs. But this was different in scale. Entire buildings had folded in on themselves. The ground was fractured, great rifts opening in the pavement. Fires burned in at least three locations she could see. And everywhere, everywhere, there were people trapped in the rubble.

The Landmates had deployed from the helicopters with the same mechanical precision they did everything else. Drop from five meters, land with a burst of jump jets, assume formation. Now they stood in the middle of devastation, waiting for commands.

Major Tanaka was coordinating with the on-site incident commander, a fire department captain whose face was streaked with soot and whose voice carried the edge of controlled panic. Around them, first responders worked frantically—pulling at debris, calling out for survivors, setting up triage stations.

> "Yoshika," Tanaka called. "You're on Unit One. Captain Hayashi needs that residential block cleared. Four-story building, partial collapse, multiple trapped."

Naoko moved to the first Landmate, her training taking over despite the chaos around her.

> "Unit One, follow me."

The machine fell into step beside her, its three-meter frame drawing stares from the first responders as she led it toward the collapsed building. The structure had pancaked on one side, the upper floors crushing down onto the lower ones. Smoke was rising from somewhere inside—not a full fire yet, but it would be soon.

A firefighter waved her over frantically.

> "We've got at least three people in there. Ground floor, under that section." He pointed at a massive concrete slab, probably part of the second floor. "We can't lift it. We tried jacks, but it's too heavy and too unstable."

Naoko looked at the slab. It had to weigh several tons. A crane could lift it, but the nearest crane was probably dealing with a dozen other collapses, and time was everything.

She turned to the Landmate.

> "Unit One, lift that concrete slab and hold it steady."

The machine moved forward without hesitation. It positioned itself beside the slab, got its hands underneath the edge, and lifted.

The concrete rose as if it were made of foam. The Landmate held it there, perfectly still, its servos barely humming.

> "Go, go, go!" the firefighter shouted.

Rescue workers scrambled into the space beneath the slab. Naoko could hear them calling out, see movement in the darkness. Within minutes they were bringing people out—two adults, one child, all alive. Injured, but alive.

> "Clear!" someone shouted.

> "Unit One, set it down gently and step back."

The Landmate lowered the slab with the same precision it had lifted it. Not a drop, not a jolt. Just smooth, controlled movement that probably saved the lives of everyone who'd been working underneath.

The firefighter stared at the machine, then at Naoko.

> "Can it do that again?"

> "As many times as we need it to."

### Across Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 1647 hours JST

The sun was beginning its descent toward the horizon, painting the smoke-filled sky in shades of orange and amber. Across six wards of Tokyo, the Landmates worked.

In Shinagawa, Unit Two stood beside a collapsed apartment complex, its hands gripping a massive concrete support beam that had buckled during the quake. The structure above threatened to pancake further, trapping the twelve people still inside. The machine held the beam steady—tons of concrete and steel balanced perfectly motionless—while rescue workers crawled through the space beneath, calling out to survivors.

> "Hold position," the operator commanded through the radio.

The Landmate stood. Minutes passed. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. The machine's servos hummed quietly, its armor streaked with concrete dust, but it showed no sign of strain. When the last survivor was finally extracted, the operator gave the release command, and Unit Two lowered the beam with the same precision it had lifted it.

In Odaiba, Unit Five waded through water that came up to its waist—chest-high for any human. The tsunami warning had brought seawater surging into the low-lying district, flooding basements and ground floors. The Landmate moved through the murky water without hesitation, following the thermal signatures that its operator called out via radio. It reached a partially submerged car, tore the door off its hinges with one hand, and carefully extracted the elderly woman trapped inside. Then it waded back through the flood, holding her above the water line, until it reached the emergency personnel waiting on higher ground.

Across the bay in Koto, Unit Seven worked at the remains of a shopping center. The building's upper floors had collapsed onto the parking structure below, creating a maze of twisted steel and shattered concrete. Conventional equipment couldn't navigate the unstable debris field. The Landmate could.

> "Move forward ten meters, then clear the steel beams blocking the path," the operator directed.

The machine stepped carefully through the wreckage, its weight distribution perfect despite the unstable ground. It reached the obstruction—several I-beams weighing hundreds of kilograms each, tangled together—and began pulling them apart. The metal groaned and shrieked as the Landmate bent and moved steel that should have required cutting torches. Within minutes, a path opened, allowing rescue workers to reach three people who'd been trapped in a pocket beneath the debris.

Near Tokyo Station, Unit Three stood in an inferno. The office tower had caught fire after the quake ruptured a gas line, and the flames had spread to three floors. Firefighters had located two people on the fourth floor, cut off by flames on the stairwell, but couldn't reach them through the heat.

The Landmate simply walked into the building.

The operator watched through the thermal camera feed, tracking the machine's progress. The heat inside would have killed a human in seconds. The Landmate's armor glowed orange in the infrared, but it moved without hesitation, following the operator's directions up the damaged stairwell. It found the survivors huddled in an office, swept them both up in its arms, and walked back through the flames.

When it emerged, the machine's gray armor was blackened with soot and still radiating heat. But there was no damage. No melting. No compromise of its systems. It set the survivors down gently near the paramedics, turned, and stood ready for the next command.

In Setagaya, Unit Nine was doing something no human rescue worker could safely attempt. A gas station had collapsed, its fuel tanks ruptured but not yet ignited. The whole area reeked of gasoline. One spark would turn it into an inferno. But there were people trapped in the attached convenience store.

The Landmate walked into the gas-soaked area, located the survivors, and carried them out one by one. No sparks from its servos. No ignition source from its systems. Just careful, methodical extraction while emergency crews stood ready with foam suppressant, praying the machine's judgment was as good as the reports suggested.

It was.

As evening fell across Tokyo, the pattern repeated at site after site. Landmates lifting what couldn't be lifted. Moving through conditions where humans couldn't survive. Working without rest, without complaint, without the limitations of flesh and bone.

### JSDF Emergency Coordination Center, Ichigaya
### November 18, 2026 - 2247 hours JST

Naoko sat in the operator station, her voice hoarse from hours of giving commands. Around her, nine other operators worked their units, their voices calm despite the exhaustion that showed on their faces. The coordination center hummed with controlled urgency—status updates, deployment requests, casualty reports.

On the main display, a map of Tokyo showed the disaster response in real-time. Blue dots marked active Landmate positions. Red zones indicated fires. Orange showed structural damage. The blue dots moved steadily from site to site, never stopping, never slowing.

Major Tanaka stood at the command station, coordinating with incident commanders across the affected areas.

> "Unit Six, relocate to Minato. Collapsed bridge, multiple vehicles trapped underneath."

> "Unit Four, Shibuya needs heavy lift support. Office building threatening to collapse onto evacuation route."

> "Unit Eight, stand by. We're getting reports of a gas leak in your area. May need you for hazardous environment extraction."

Naoko checked her status board. Unit One had been operational for nine hours straight. No performance degradation. No maintenance required. The machine was currently holding up a damaged highway overpass while engineers assessed whether it could be stabilized or needed controlled demolition.

Her radio crackled.

> "This is Fire Command Sector Seven. We need Unit One at a school collapse in Toyosu. Three-story building. We have confirmed signs of life but can't reach them safely."

Naoko felt her exhaustion evaporate.

> "Understood, Command. Redirecting now."

She keyed her command frequency.

> "Unit One, current task complete?"

A moment's pause while the engineers on site confirmed. Then: "Structure secured. Unit cleared for redeployment."

> "Unit One, proceed to evacuation vehicle at your location. You're being relocated to Toyosu."

On her screen, the blue dot began moving.

Naoko glanced at the clock. Almost eleven at night. The Landmates had been working for over eight hours. Conventional equipment would need refueling, maintenance, operator rotation. The Landmates just kept going.

Major Tanaka appeared beside her station.

> "Status?"

> "All units operational. No failures, no degradation. They're performing beyond spec, sir."

> "I know. Command is already drafting reports for the UN Initiative." He paused, looking at the map. "Yoshika, preliminary casualty estimates are coming in. We're looking at just over four hundred dead."

Naoko felt the weight of that number.

> "That's... that's still so many."

> "The models predicted over a thousand by now." Tanaka's voice was quiet. "The Landmates aren't magic. They can't prevent an earthquake or undo the damage. But they're making a difference. A significant one."

On the main display, the blue dots continued their tireless work across the darkened city. Nine machines deployed, one held in reserve, all of them working alongside thousands of human first responders.

Naoko looked at her status board, at the simple readouts that showed Unit One approaching the collapsed school in Toyosu.

> "Unit One, you're approaching the site. Prepare for heavy lift and precision extraction. There are children in there."

The radio crackled with acknowledgment—not words, the Landmates didn't speak—but a subtle shift in the unit's readiness state that her interface detected.

She leaned forward, focused on her screens, ready to guide the machine through whatever came next.

Outside, Tokyo burned and shook and struggled to save itself.

And the Landmates, tireless and precise, continued helping however they were commanded.

### Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 2301 hours JST

The aftershock hit without warning.

Naoko was outside the coordination vehicle, stretching her legs during a brief lull in deployments, when the ground lurched beneath her feet. Not as violent as the initial quake, but violent enough. The pavement cracked with sounds like gunshots. The coordination vehicle rocked on its suspension. Someone inside shouted a warning.

Then the building beside her—already damaged, already compromised—began to collapse.

Naoko ran. Debris crashed behind her, dust billowing through the street. She heard voices shouting, the screech of twisting metal, the thunder of concrete hitting asphalt. Her radio was screaming with traffic—multiple reports, new collapses, the organized chaos of disaster response suddenly thrown back into crisis.

She rounded a corner, coughing in the dust cloud, trying to orient herself. The street lights were out. Emergency lights strobed in the distance. She'd been separated from the coordination center, from her team, from—

A shape loomed through the dust. Three meters tall. Motionless.

A Landmate.

Naoko stumbled toward it, relief flooding through her. One of their units, standing in the middle of the street. Unit Six, if she remembered the deployment map correctly. Its armor was covered in concrete dust, but it stood perfectly still, waiting.

She grabbed her radio.

> "This is Operator Yoshika. I'm separated from the coordination center, I have visual on Unit Six. Requesting connection to command frequency."

Static. The aftershock must have disrupted communications. She tried again, got the same result.

Behind her, she could hear screaming. The collapse had trapped people. First responders were calling for help, for equipment, for anything that could lift the debris.

Naoko looked up at the Landmate.

> "Unit Six, respond to voice command. Acknowledge."

The machine stood motionless.

Right. Without the radio link, without the command frequency, it wouldn't respond to her voice alone. The units were keyed to their assigned operators through the coordination system. She wasn't Unit Six's operator. She couldn't just—

More screaming. Someone was trapped. Someone was dying while she stood here with a perfectly functional rescue machine that wouldn't listen to her.

> "Move!" she shouted at it. "People need help! Unit Six, move!"

Nothing.

Frustration boiled over into desperation. Naoko slammed her fists against the Landmate's chest armor, the impacts sending sharp pain through her hands but not even marking the machine's surface.

> "Move, damn you! We have to help!"

The Landmate stood silent.

Naoko hit it again, and again, her hands throbbing, her throat raw from shouting. Nine hours of coordinating rescues, of watching these machines save lives, and now when she needed one—when people were dying just meters away—it stood there like a statue, like it had for those first three weeks after delivery.

She drew back her fist for another futile strike.

Then the Landmate's chest opened.

Naoko froze.

The armor plates split along seams she'd never noticed before. Two panels folded upward, two downward, revealing an interior space that glowed with soft amber light. Inside was a seat—not mechanical, but curved and padded, almost organically shaped to fit a human form. And around it, a framework of something that looked like metal and carbon fiber woven together, skeletal and precise, with attachment points at shoulders, waist, wrists, and ankles.

A harness.

A cockpit.

Naoko stared at the open chest cavity, at the seat waiting inside, at the harness that looked designed to hold a human body.

All this time. Seven weeks of voice commands, of radio frequencies, of treating these machines like remote-controlled equipment.

And they'd been designed to be piloted.

Her radio crackled back to life.

> "—shika, respond. Yoshika, what's your status?"

But Naoko couldn't answer. She stood in the dusty Tokyo street, staring at the open Landmate, at the invitation it offered, while somewhere behind her people screamed for help she didn't know how to give.

The amber light inside the cockpit pulsed gently, waiting.

Naoko had read Appleseed cover to cover. Multiple times. She'd watched the anime adaptations, studied the technical diagrams that Shirow had lovingly detailed in the margins. She recognized this. The seat. The harness. The cybernetic interface between human and machine.

A landmate. Not in name only, but in function. An exoskeleton amplifier. A human-machine hybrid.

She didn't think. Didn't calculate the risks or consider the consequences. People were dying. The machine was waiting. And she knew—she knew—what this meant.

Naoko grabbed the chest armor's edge and pulled herself up.

The Landmate's frame provided handholds she hadn't noticed before, subtle recesses in the armor that her fingers found instinctively. She climbed into the cockpit, swung her legs over the seat's edge, and—

The harness moved.

Metal bands erupted from the seat's sides like living things, snaking around her ankles with mechanical precision. She felt them wrap, tighten, lock into place with soft clicks that reverberated through the frame. Before she could react, more bands shot up from the seat itself, coiling around her thighs, her hips, each one constricting with enough force to hold her but not quite enough to hurt.

> "No! Wait—"

Struts extended from the seat back, lying flat against her arms. She tried to pull away, but the leg restraints held her in place. The struts pressed against her forearms, her upper arms, conforming to the shape of her limbs with disturbing accuracy. Bands wrapped around her wrists, her elbows, her shoulders—not tight enough to cut off circulation, but secure enough that she couldn't move.

> "No, no, no, no!!"

Belts shot out from the seat's sides, crossing over her chest in an X-pattern, then wrapping around her waist. They pulled taut, pressing her back firmly into the seat. She tried to struggle, but the harness had already immobilized her limbs. More bands secured her hips, her lower back, every major joint locked into position.

Then something cold touched the back of her head.

Metallic pressure points made contact with her skull—behind her ears, at the base of her neck, along the sides of her head above her temples. She felt the structure closing around her like a crown, or a cage, each contact point pressing with gentle but inexorable force. Not painful, but present. Undeniable. Something that felt like it was reading her, mapping her, connecting to her in ways she didn't understand.

> "Stop! Please, I don't—"

The chest panels began to close.

Amber light gave way to shadow as the armor plates swung shut with mechanical certainty. Two panels from above, two from below, sealing with the same precise clicks she'd heard from the restraints. The last sliver of dusty Tokyo street disappeared as the panels met, merged, became seamless.

Darkness.

Complete, absolute darkness.

Naoko's breathing came in short, sharp gasps. The harness held her immobile, the struts against her limbs preventing even the smallest movement. The metallic structure around her head felt like it was tightening, though rationally she knew it wasn't. The seat cradled her body in a grip that was almost gentle but absolutely unyielding.

She'd climbed into a three-meter-tall machine that she didn't know how to operate, that no one had trained her to use, that might not even be designed for someone of her size or physiology. She was trapped inside a Federation creation that had just sealed her in its chest cavity, restrained her with bands she couldn't break, and was now doing something to her head that she couldn't see or understand.

The screaming outside was muffled now, distant through layers of armor that could withstand fire and crushing force.

What had she been thinking? That she'd just climb in and know how to use it? That it would somehow be intuitive, like in the manga? That the desperate situation would somehow make her compatible with technology decades beyond anything Earth could produce?

She'd made a mistake. A terrible, impulsive mistake driven by nine hours of exhaustion and the sound of people dying in the rubble behind her.

And now she was locked inside a machine she couldn't control, couldn't escape, couldn't—

Light.

The darkness vanished as the cockpit interior blazed to life. Not harsh fluorescent white, but a soft, omnidirectional glow that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Naoko blinked against the sudden illumination, her panic momentarily forgotten.

Then the view changed.

Suddenly she was looking at the street from three meters up. The collapsed building. The dust still settling from the aftershock. The coordination vehicle on its side, emergency lights still flashing. Her perspective had shifted—not through the cockpit walls, but as if she were standing at the Landmate's height, seeing through its eyes, her viewpoint elevated far above where her body actually sat sealed in the machine's chest.

Naoko turned her head. The view shifted with her, smooth and natural, showing her the rubble to one side, first responders to the other. She could still feel the harness, still sense her body restrained in the seat below, but her vision—her awareness—extended upward and outward to sensors mounted in the Landmate's head.

She looked down.

She could see her own body, dimly visible in the ambient light of the cockpit, strapped into the seat. But beyond it, through it somehow, she also saw the Landmate's legs, its armored feet planted on cracked pavement. Dual awareness. She was both inside the machine and somehow looking through it.

She tried to move her hand, just a twitch of her fingers—

The Landmate's hand rose into view, five massive fingers flexing exactly as her own fingers flexed inside the cockpit. She opened her hand wider. The Landmate's hand opened. She rotated her wrist. The machine's wrist rotated with mechanical precision, mirroring her movement perfectly.

It was her hand. The Landmate's hand was her hand.

She tried lifting her arm, and the massive armored limb rose into her field of vision, responding to her intention as naturally as her own flesh and blood. The weight of it registered somehow—not heavy, exactly, but present. She could feel the mass, the power, the potential force contained in that mechanical limb as clearly as she felt her own muscles.

Naoko tried to take a step.

Her foot came down heavy. Too heavy. The pavement cracked beneath the Landmate's weight with a sharp report that made her freeze. She'd just... she'd just moved three meters and several tons of machine with a thought, with the same casual motion she'd use to walk to the bathroom.

She tried the next step more carefully. Thinking about it. Conscious of the weight, the balance, the way her body's center of gravity had shifted upward and outward. The Landmate's foot lifted, moved forward, set down with controlled precision. Better. More natural. The machine responded to intention, to the subtle shifts in her muscles that the harness detected, translated, amplified into motion that should have required hydraulics and complex control systems.

Information appeared in her vision.

Not text on a screen, exactly. More like labels floating in space, overlaying her view of the world. A readout in the upper right showing power levels—a simple bar indicator, full, with text beside it in Japanese: "Power Remaining: 100%". In the upper left, a compass rose with cardinal directions marked. Lower right, a simple menu system with options that made intuitive sense: "Lighting", "Communications", "Sensors", "Systems".

All labeled in Japanese characters, positioned exactly where she'd naturally look for them. All accessible through some combination of thought and motion that she somehow understood without being taught.

Naoko focused her attention on the communications menu, simply looking at it with intention. The indicator expanded without any physical touch, opening into a submenu. Radio frequencies. Emergency channels. Command links. All inactive, waiting for her to select one.

She flexed her other hand, feeling the power in those mechanical fingers. Took another step, then another, the movements becoming more fluid as her mind adapted to the machine's mass and momentum. She turned her head, and the view shifted smoothly, naturally, as if she were simply looking around rather than watching a screen.

The panic was fading, replaced by something else.

Realization.

It was going to be that intuitive.

The harness wasn't restraining her. It was reading her. The struts against her limbs, the bands around her joints, the pressure points on her skull—they were mapping her movements, her intentions, her body's subtle signals, and translating them into motion for a three-meter frame that moved like an extension of her own body.

She'd climbed into an Appleseed landmate. And it worked exactly like Shirow had imagined it would.

Behind her—behind the Landmate—she could still hear the screaming. The people trapped in the rubble. The first responders calling for equipment they didn't have.

Naoko looked at her massive armored hands, flexed her fingers, felt the power contained in each digit.

She could help them.

She took a step toward the collapsed building, then another, the Landmate's stride eating up ground with mechanical precision. The weight felt natural now, the movements fluid, as if she'd been doing this her entire life rather than for thirty seconds.

The interface updated automatically, sensors highlighting heat signatures in the rubble, structural weak points, the safest approach vector. Information she needed, presented the moment she needed it, in a language she could read, through a display system that felt more like augmented vision than watching a screen.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, Naoko Yoshika knew she should be terrified. She was sealed inside a Federation machine, connected to systems she didn't understand, controlling technology that shouldn't exist.

But people were dying.

And she had the power to save them.

She broke into a run.

The motion felt strange at first—each stride covering three times what her legs normally would, the ground rushing past faster than she'd ever moved on foot. But the interface adapted, the view stabilizing, compensating for the machine's gait. Within seconds, running felt natural. Powerful. The Landmate's legs ate up the distance to the collapsed building in massive strides.

As she approached, the display updated. Three outlines appeared in her vision, highlighted in pulsing orange through the rubble. Human-shaped. Two smaller, one larger. Heat signatures, she realized. The Landmate's sensors showing her exactly where the trapped people were, even buried under concrete and steel.

Naoko reached the building and dropped to one knee, the motion smooth despite the machine's mass. The largest heat signature was directly beneath a concrete slab—part of the building's second floor that had collapsed onto the ground level. The slab had to weigh several tons.

She reached down with both of the Landmate's hands, got her fingers under the edge of the concrete, and lifted.

The slab rose. Not easily, exactly—she felt resistance, a pressure against her movements, like trying to lift something heavy through water. But it rose. The Landmate's servos hummed, power flowing through hydraulics and mechanisms she couldn't see, translating her intention into force measured in tons.

Naoko held the slab with one hand, keeping it steady above her head. The resistance shifted, concentrating in her left arm now, a constant pressure that let her gauge exactly how much weight she was holding. Not the actual tonnage—the machine was doing that work—but enough feedback that she could feel it, adjust for it, keep it stable.

The interface was giving her proprioception for a body that wasn't hers. Letting her sense weight and resistance even though her actual muscles were doing nothing but making small movements against the harness. The machine did the work, but she could feel the effort, gauge the load, understand the limits.

With her free hand, she reached into the space beneath the slab. The first person—adult, male, unconscious—was partially buried in rubble. She brushed aside smaller debris with the Landmate's massive fingers, movements that should have been impossibly clumsy but somehow weren't. The harness translated her intent into precision, letting the mechanical hands move with the delicacy of a surgeon.

She got her fingers around the man's torso and lifted him clear, cradling him in the Landmate's palm. Set him down gently on clear pavement, away from the danger zone.

The second outline. Smaller. A woman, also unconscious, one arm trapped under a steel beam. Naoko shifted her grip on the slab with her left hand, felt the resistance adjust as the weight redistributed. Reached in with her right hand and carefully moved the beam aside. The metal groaned but bent under the Landmate's strength. She extracted the woman with the same careful precision, set her down beside the man.

The third signature was deeper, partially covered by fragments from what might have been an interior wall. Naoko lowered the slab slightly—feeling the resistance decrease in her left arm as she let the weight descend—and reached further into the space. A child. Small. Still breathing, according to the thermal overlay showing shallow respiration patterns.

She cleared the debris with infinite care, her massive mechanical fingers somehow gentle enough to move broken drywall without disturbing the unconscious child beneath. Got her hand under the small body, lifted with a touch so light she barely registered any feedback at all.

The child came free. Naoko cradled the small form in the Landmate's palm, feeling almost nothing—the interface telling her this weight was negligible, barely worth registering. She pulled her arm back and set the child down beside the adults.

Then she lowered the concrete slab, letting it settle back onto the rubble with a controlled descent. The resistance in her left arm faded as the weight transferred back to the ground.

Three people. Thirty seconds, maybe. A task that would have required cutting equipment, heavy machinery, and a team of rescuers working for an hour.

Naoko straightened, looking at the three unconscious forms laid out on the pavement. Already she could see first responders running toward them, medical personnel moving in with stretchers and equipment.

The display highlighted more signatures. Five buildings away, four people trapped. Another location, two more. Across the district, dozens of heat signatures buried in rubble, waiting for help that conventional rescue teams would take hours to reach.

She turned toward the nearest cluster of signatures, the Landmate's body responding to her intent, and started running again.

The machine provided feedback, let her sense weight and resistance, translated her movements into tons of force and precision measured in millimeters.

But it did the work.

And Naoko realized, with a clarity that cut through exhaustion and shock and nine hours of coordinating rescues, exactly what the Federation had given them.

Not just machines that followed commands.

Tools that amplified human will into superhuman capability.

She reached the next collapse site and dropped to her knees, already scanning for the best approach to extract the people trapped beneath.

### Across Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18-19, 2026 - 2315-0247 hours JST

The night blurred into a sequence of collapses, extractions, and the steady rhythm of moving rubble.

At the third site, a firefighter nearly dropped his equipment when he saw Naoko approach. The Landmate moved with purpose through the debris field, navigating obstacles without hesitation, without any visible operator nearby giving commands.

> "Holy shit, is it autonomous?"

> "Can't be. They need voice commands. Radio control. They don't just... move on their own."

Naoko ignored them, focused on the heat signatures the display was showing her. Four people, trapped in what had been a convenience store. She knelt and began clearing debris, her movements deliberate and controlled.

A civil engineer approached cautiously, hard hat in hand, staring up at the machine.

> "Unit Six? Can you hear me? Who's commanding you?"

Naoko turned her head to look at him. The motion was smooth, natural. The engineer took a step back.

> "It responded. But there's no operator station here. No command vehicle."

> "Maybe someone's broadcasting commands from the coordination center?"

> "From kilometers away? Through all this chaos? Look at how it's moving. That's not remote control. That's... I don't know what that is."

Naoko returned her attention to the collapse. She reached in and extracted the first victim, setting them down gently near the medical team. Then the second. The third.

It was only when she stood and turned to leave that one of the firefighters noticed something.

> "Wait. The chest panels. They're closed. I thought they opened for maintenance or something."

> "They do. But there's nothing inside except the frame and systems. I've seen the technical briefings."

They watched as the Landmate jogged away toward another cluster of emergency lights, its stride purposeful and directed.

> "Then how the hell is it operating?"

No one had an answer.

At the fourth site, Naoko discovered a new capability by accident.

She'd been about to lift a section of collapsed roof when her vision changed. The structural overlay appeared unbidden, triggered by her focus on the damaged building. Lines of force flowed through the display, color-coded by stress. Red zones marked where the structure was on the verge of catastrophic failure. Yellow showed dangerous but stable areas. Green indicated solid load-bearing sections.

A menu appeared in her lower left vision: "Structural Analysis Active".

Below it, text in Japanese scrolled past. Recommendations. The northwest support column needed immediate reinforcement—it was holding most of the remaining structure's weight. The debris pile to her right could be safely removed without triggering further collapse. The eastern wall should not be disturbed until the roof section was secured.

Naoko stared at the overlay, then looked at the support column. It was cracked, visibly bowing under load. If it failed, the entire remaining structure would come down on the rescue workers currently inside.

She moved to the column and braced it with both hands, holding it steady. Felt the resistance as tons of weight settled against her arms. The Landmate's servos hummed, compensating, distributing the load.

> "What the hell?" A rescue worker emerged from inside the building. "Did it just... did it know we needed that reinforced?"

> "Structural sensors," an engineer called from nearby. "It must have analyzed the building stability. But I've never seen one move without direct commands before."

Naoko held the column while the rescue team extracted three more people from the building. Eight minutes. Her arms didn't tire. The machine didn't strain. It simply held, unwavering, until the last person was clear.

When she released the column and stepped back, it shifted slightly but held. The rescue workers emerged with their final extraction, staring up at the Landmate that had somehow known exactly what they needed.

By midnight, Naoko had worked her way through seven collapse sites. Her body was exhausted—she could feel it in the harness, in her actual arms and legs making small movements that the machine amplified. But the Landmate showed no signs of fatigue.

At the eighth site, she attempted something she'd been considering for the past hour.

The most direct route to the heat signatures was blocked by a massive fissure in the street—probably three meters wide, opened by the aftershock. The alternative route would add five minutes to her response time. Five minutes that the people trapped in the building ahead might not have.

Naoko looked at the gap, at the cracked edges still settling.

She took three steps back, building momentum in her mind. The Landmate responded, backing up with her. Then she ran forward.

Four strides. Five. Her speed building. At the edge of the fissure, she jumped.

The jets fired automatically as she left the ground, blue-white thrust vectoring from beneath her feet and from the back-mounted units. The Landmate soared across the gap with controlled power, the boost giving her easily twice the distance she could have managed with muscle alone. Naoko's stomach lurched with the acceleration, but the motion felt natural, intuitive.

She landed on the far side, the jets cutting out, letting her momentum carry her forward into a run. The impact cracked the pavement slightly, but the Landmate's legs absorbed the force without issue.

Behind her, across the fissure, a group of rescue workers stood staring.

> "Did it just..."

> "The jump jets. We knew they had those. But I've never seen one use them like that. Not without direct commands."

> "How is it even knowing where to go?"

Naoko didn't look back. She had heat signatures to reach.

At 0147 hours, Naoko discovered the medical assessment system.

She'd just pulled four people from a collapsed restaurant. As she laid them out for the medical team, her vision overlaid new information. Not just heat signatures now, but vital signs. Heart rates. Respiration. Injury markers highlighting where each person was wounded.

One of the four—a middle-aged man—had a highlighted chest. Red indicator. Text appeared: "Suspected Internal Bleeding. Priority: Critical. Estimated Time: 15-20 minutes."

Naoko looked at the medical team organizing their triage. They were working from visual assessment, hadn't reached the man yet. Still treating someone with more obvious injuries.

She stepped over to the man, knelt, and carefully touched his shoulder with one massive finger. Gentle pressure, just enough to draw attention.

A paramedic looked up, startled.

Naoko lifted her hand and pointed at the man, then at her own chest area, trying to communicate. The gesture was clumsy with the Landmate's size, but clear enough.

The paramedic frowned, then moved to the man. Started her assessment. Her expression changed.

> "Internal bleeding! Get the trauma kit, now! He's critical!"

The team swarmed the patient. The paramedic looked up at the Landmate, at the machine that had somehow known what her trained eyes had missed in the chaos.

> "How did you...?"

But Naoko was already moving to the next site, where three more heat signatures waited beneath rubble.

The medical overlay remained active now. Every person she extracted got assessed automatically. Injury severity. Treatment priority. Time sensitivity. Information that could mean the difference between life and death, presented in clean Japanese text overlaying her vision.

The Federation had built these machines to save lives.

And now, sealed inside one of them, Naoko was beginning to understand just how thoroughly they'd designed them for that purpose.

By 0247 hours, she'd lost count of the rescues.

Twenty sites? Thirty? The thermal signatures blurred together. Men, women, children. Buried under concrete, trapped in collapsed cars, pinned beneath steel beams. She pulled them out, assessed their injuries, placed them where medical teams could reach them.

The Landmate's power indicator still read 93%. Her own body was running on adrenaline and desperation. The harness supported her, held her immobile, but she could feel exhaustion in every small movement.

Another collapse site. More heat signatures.

Naoko dropped to her knees and started digging.

Behind her, a JSDF officer stood watching, speaking quietly into his radio.

> "Confirm visual on Unit Six. Still operating independently. I've been tracking it for three hours now, twenty-plus rescue sites. Sir, I need clarification on operational protocols. The briefings said these units require voice commands or radio direction. But Unit Six is moving with purpose, analyzing structures, triaging casualties, using its jump jets for tactical positioning. It's acting like it has situational awareness. Like it's making decisions. Sir, with respect, I need to know if there's something about these machines we weren't told. Because what I'm watching doesn't match any of our training materials."
