## Chapter 5: Ascent

A slight wind kicked up across the parking lot, swirling debris and causing loose papers to scatter. Marisa felt it first—a change in air pressure, a subtle disturbance that made her ears pop. The sodium lights overhead flickered.

> "Look up," LeBouf said quietly.

Marisa tilted her head back. At first, she saw nothing but the orange-tinted night sky of industrial New Jersey. Then the air *shimmered*.

It started as a distortion, like heat haze on summer asphalt, but wrong—too precise, too geometric. The shimmer spread outward in a shape that shouldn't exist, revealing angular surfaces that caught the light in ways that made her eyes hurt to focus on. Black panels that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. Surfaces that shifted between matte and glossy as if the material itself couldn't decide what it was.

The craft materialized from nothing, settling toward the parking lot with impossible silence. No roar of engines. No downdraft from rotors. Just that gentle wind and the soft *hiss* of something moving through air that didn't want to move.

It was enormous. Fifty meters long at least, shaped like a flattened diamond or an arrowhead, all sharp angles and aggressive geometry. The nose was impossibly sharp, the body flowing back into wings that were too thin, too elegant, breaking every rule of aerodynamics Marisa had ever learned. The entire surface seemed to be made of those light-absorbing panels, broken only by subtle seams and what might have been sensor ports glowing with faint blue light.

The craft touched down on extended landing gear that looked too delicate to support its mass, settling with barely a whisper of contact. A ramp extended from the ventral surface with a soft hydraulic hiss, lowering to the parking lot asphalt. The interior beyond was lit with that same dim blue glow from the sensor ports.

Marisa stood frozen, her mind struggling to process what she was seeing. Beside her, Hartfield had gone pale, his hand unconsciously gripping his rifle tighter.

> "What the fuck," Rodriguez breathed.

LeBouf was already moving toward the craft, his two teammates flanking him. He called back over his shoulder, urgency cutting through his usual calm.

> "Hurry up and board. We have fifty-six minutes, and this is your ticket to San Francisco."

Marisa's feet moved before her brain fully engaged, training and desperation overriding the shock. Hartfield grabbed her arm.

> "Comey, that's not a plane. That's not any aircraft I've ever—"

> "I know," Marisa said, pulling free. "But it's also our only option. Move."

They ran toward the craft, Martinez and Rodriguez following. As they approached, Marisa could see the interior more clearly through the opening. Not a cargo bay or passenger compartment—something else. Seats that looked molded from the same angular material as the exterior, arranged in two rows facing each other. Restraint systems that were far more complex than standard five-point harnesses. Panels covered in what looked like medical equipment.

LeBouf waited at the entrance, literally bouncing on his toes with an energy that was completely at odds with his usual composed demeanor. The moment they were close enough, he started talking, words coming fast, his accent thick with stress.

> "This is Shade. The plane itself *is* Shade. It's an AI—artificial intelligence—fully autonomous. It will be taking us to space and back down to reach San Francisco in just over twenty minutes."

> "Space," Hartfield repeated flatly. "You're saying we're going to *space*."

> "Suborbital trajectory, yes." LeBouf was already climbing into the craft, gesturing for them to follow. "Get in, strap in immediately. We'll provide countermeasures—pressure suits, medications, monitoring—but blacking out is expected and normal. Your bodies are not designed for this kind of acceleration."

Marisa hauled herself through the opening, her hands finding purchase on surfaces that felt warm and almost organic. The interior was cramped despite the craft's size, every centimeter optimized for function. The seats—if they could be called that—were less like furniture and more like form-fitting cocoons.

The other two ESF operators were already strapped in, their visors down, moving with practiced efficiency. LeBouf was helping Martinez into one of the seats, his hands moving rapidly over the complex restraint system.

> "Arms here, legs here, head back against the rest. The system will conform to your body. Do not fight it. Shade will monitor your vitals and provide support as needed."

Marisa dropped into a seat, and immediately the material shifted, flowing around her limbs like liquid becoming solid. Restraints snaked across her chest, her thighs, her shoulders, locking into place with soft *clicks*. A panel extended from the headrest, curving around to position itself in front of her face—a helmet or mask of some kind, already sealing against her skin.

> "Wait—" she started, but the mask was already locked in place, and suddenly she could breathe easier, the air tasting pure and cold.

Shade's voice filled her ears, coming through the mask's integrated speakers with that same measured, genderless tone.

> "Agent Comey. Welcome aboard. Please remain calm. I am monitoring your vitals. Heart rate elevated but acceptable. Beginning pre-flight preparation."

Marisa looked around wildly. Hartfield was in the seat across from her, his eyes wide behind his own mask. Martinez and Rodriguez were further back, both looking terrified. LeBouf was the last to strap in, his movements hurried, almost frantic.

Hartfield's voice came through the comm system, muffled by his mask but clear.

> "LeBouf. Have you done this before? This... whatever this is?"

LeBouf's hands were still shaking as he finished securing his own restraints. When he spoke, his accent was so thick Marisa could barely understand him.

> "Yes. Many times."

> "Then why," Hartfield pressed, his voice tight, "do you look just as anxious as the rest of us?"

LeBouf's unremarkable face turned toward Hartfield, and for once, his expression was completely honest. Raw. Almost haunted.

> "Because you don't get used to it," he said quietly. "It just gets less bad each time."

The ramp retracted with a soft hydraulic hiss, sealing into the hull with a final, definitive *snap*. The interior lighting shifted from white to a dim red. Marisa felt the craft shudder—not mechanically, but as if it were a living thing preparing to move.

Shade's voice returned, calm and precise.

> "All personnel secured. Systems nominal. Filing emergency flight plan with FAA. Cloaking system active. Initiating launch sequence."

> "Wait—" Marisa tried to say, but her voice came out as barely a whisper.

> "Launch in five seconds," Shade announced. "Four. Three. Two. One."

> "Merde," LeBouf breathed.

The world disappeared.

---

It wasn't like takeoff. It wasn't like anything Marisa had ever experienced.

The acceleration hit like a physical blow, slamming her back into the seat with a force that emptied her lungs in a single, involuntary gasp. Her vision immediately tunneled, the red-lit interior collapsing to a pinpoint of light surrounded by darkness. The pressure wasn't just on her chest—it was everywhere, crushing down on every square inch of her body as if the air itself had turned solid.

She tried to breathe and couldn't. Her chest wouldn't expand. The mask pumped pure oxygen into her lungs, forcing air past the weight pressing down on her ribs, but it wasn't enough. Her heart hammered against the acceleration, struggling to push blood upward against gravity that had tripled, quadrupled, multiplied beyond anything human bodies were meant to endure.

Through the narrowing tunnel of her vision, she saw Hartfield. His face was distorted, skin pulled back against his skull by the g-forces, lips peeled away from his teeth in an involuntary grimace. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, bulging slightly from the pressure. He was trying to say something, but no sound came out—or if it did, Marisa couldn't hear it over the roar of blood in her ears.

Martinez was worse. The younger agent's head had lolled to one side despite the restraints, his face ashen, veins standing out in stark relief against his neck. His eyes had already rolled back, whites showing.

Across from her, LeBouf looked like he was dying. His jaw was clenched so tight she could see the muscles standing out like cables, his breathing coming in sharp, desperate gasps through his mask. But his eyes were open, focused, locked on something only he could see. This wasn't his first time, she realized. He knew exactly how bad it was going to get.

Shade's voice cut through the pressure, clinical and detached.

> "Maximum acceleration. Seven point four gravities. Duration: forty-two seconds. All vitals in acceptable ranges. Maintain position."

Seven point four gravities. Marisa's mind tried to process that and failed. She weighed—what?—a thousand pounds now? More? Her arms were pinned to the armrests, too heavy to lift. Her head pressed back into the headrest so hard she thought her skull might crack.

Then her veins caught fire.

It started in her arms, a sensation like ice water and molten metal injected simultaneously into her bloodstream. The pain was sharp, precise, spreading through her circulatory system in waves that she could feel moving from her extremities toward her core. Her neck, her chest, her legs—every major vessel suddenly burned and froze at once.

> "Administering vascular reinforcers," Shade announced, its voice still maddeningly calm. "Preventing stroke and maintaining cerebral perfusion. Discomfort is expected."

Discomfort. The word was so inadequate it would have been funny if Marisa had been capable of forming thoughts beyond the raw animal panic of her body shutting down. The sensation in her veins intensified, and she realized dimly that whatever chemicals Shade was pumping into her bloodstream were the only thing keeping her brain from hemorrhaging under the pressure.

The edges of her vision went from gray to black. She fought it, tried to stay conscious, but her body had other ideas. Blood was pooling in her lower extremities despite the reinforcers, draining from her brain despite Shade's interventions. The darkness spread inward, swallowing the red light, swallowing Hartfield's distorted face, swallowing the burning-freezing sensation in her veins, swallowing everything.

Her last coherent thought was of Rodriguez, who had stopped moving entirely.

Then nothing.

---

Outside the craft, invisible to anyone watching, something impossible was happening.

Shade rose from the parking lot on a pillar of blue-white fire, its external panels actively shifting to match the background sky and suppress any visible signature. The flames from its engines should have been visible for miles—a blazing column of plasma hot enough to vaporize asphalt—but the engine design dispersed and cooled the exhaust so efficiently that within meters of the nozzles, the thermal signature had dropped below detection thresholds.

The craft's ascent was nearly vertical, a column of invisible force punching upward through the atmosphere. It accelerated hard, pulling away from the ground with a violence that would have torn apart any conventional aircraft. The parking lot below showed no signs of disturbance—no scorch marks, no debris, nothing to indicate that a spacecraft had just launched from the middle of industrial New Jersey.

Within seconds, Shade had climbed through ten thousand feet, twenty thousand, the altimeter spinning upward in a blur. The air grew thinner, less resistant, and the craft accelerated harder, pressing its passengers deeper into their restraints. Thirty thousand feet. Forty thousand.

At fifty thousand feet, Shade punched through the altitude where conventional aircraft stopped climbing and kept going, its engines burning at full power, its trajectory flattening as it began the long arc that would take it to the edge of space and beyond. The stars became visible above, no longer twinkling but steady, brilliant points against the black.

Sixty thousand feet. Seventy thousand. The curvature of the Earth became visible now, the horizon bending, the sky above transitioning from deep blue to purple to black.

Shade's adaptive panels continued their work even as the air grew too thin to matter, the craft's angular surfaces now reflecting starlight and the faint glow of distant cities in patterns that made it impossible to resolve against the darkening sky.

Eighty thousand feet. Ninety thousand.

The engines throttled back slightly as Shade approached the apex of its boost phase, the acceleration easing from crushing to merely brutal. Inside, the passengers remained unconscious, their bodies limp in the restraints, their vitals monitored by dozens of sensors woven into the seats.

One hundred thousand feet. The boundary between atmosphere and space, crossed in less than a minute.

Shade's engines cut entirely, and the craft went ballistic, arcing upward on momentum alone. The sudden absence of acceleration would have been a relief, except none of the passengers were conscious to feel it.

Below, the eastern seaboard of the United States was visible in its entirety, a glowing network of cities against the dark curve of the Atlantic. Above, the stars burned with a clarity impossible to see from the ground, and the sun—still below the horizon for the surface—was beginning to paint the upper atmosphere with the first hints of dawn.

Shade coasted upward, silent and invisible, carrying its unconscious cargo toward the apex of its trajectory and the long fall toward California beyond.

---

Marisa woke to weightlessness and panic.

Her body was floating against the restraints, every instinct screaming that she was falling. Her stomach lurched, bile rising in her throat. The mask pumped cool air into her lungs, but it tasted wrong, felt wrong, everything was wrong—

> "Agent Comey. You are conscious. Please remain calm. We are in ballistic flight. Weightlessness is normal and expected. You are not falling."

Shade's voice cut through the panic like a knife through fog. Marisa forced her eyes open, forced herself to focus.

The cabin was still lit with that dim red glow, but now there was another light source—a viewport, or a screen, showing the view outside. And what she saw made her breath catch in her throat.

Earth. Not a picture, not a simulation. Earth itself, curving away below them, impossibly blue and white against the infinite black of space. She could see the entire East Coast from Virginia to Maine, see the Great Lakes glittering in the early morning sun, see the demarcation line between day and night cutting across the continent.

They were in *space*.

> "Holy shit," Hartfield breathed from across the cabin. His voice was hoarse, raw. "Holy *shit*."

Marisa couldn't look away from the viewport. The scale of it was overwhelming. Cities she'd lived in, airports she'd transited through, the highways and rivers and borders that defined her entire world—all of it reduced to points of light and thin lines drawn across a sphere that suddenly seemed both vast and impossibly fragile. Somewhere down there, people were waking up, making coffee, stuck in traffic, completely unaware that the world they knew was built on foundations of sand. That there were people and technologies and organizations that could do *this*—launch into space from a parking lot in New Jersey and cross a continent in the time it took to eat breakfast.

She thought about her career, about the cases she'd worked, the terrorists and criminals she'd helped bring down. People who killed for money or ideology or pure nihilism. And all of it, every investigation, every arrest, every conviction—it suddenly felt like playing in a sandbox while the adults conducted business she couldn't begin to comprehend.

The FBI didn't know. Her superiors didn't know. The President probably didn't know. Whatever the EarthSpace Federation was, whatever infrastructure and capabilities they possessed, they'd managed to operate in complete secrecy while possessing technology that made NASA look like children with model rockets. The implications made her head spin worse than the zero gravity.

And underneath the shock, underneath the existential vertigo of realizing everything she thought she knew was incomplete, there was something else. Something she couldn't quite name. A tiny spark of wonder that refused to be suppressed, no matter how terrifying the circumstances. She was seeing what maybe a few hundred people in all of human history had ever seen. The entire planet, laid out below her like a living map. The thin blue line of atmosphere that separated life from the infinite void. The stars, unwavering and brilliant, no longer filtered through miles of air.

It was beautiful. Impossibly, terrifyingly beautiful.

> "Welcome back," LeBouf said quietly, his eyes still closed. "We are at apogee. One hundred sixty-eight kilometers altitude. The view is spectacular, I am told, though I prefer not to look."

> "How can you not look?" Marisa heard herself say, her voice barely a whisper.

> "Because every time I see it," LeBouf replied, "I remember how small we are. How fragile everything is. And right now, I need to believe we are large enough and strong enough to save it."

Marisa looked around. Martinez was stirring, groaning softly. Rodriguez was still unconscious, his head lolled forward against his restraints, but she could see the gentle rise and fall of his chest.

The moment was already passing. Reality was reasserting itself. They had a job to do. Two EMP devices. Millions of lives at stake. And less than twelve minutes to stop it.

> "Ground assets have located both EMP devices," Shade announced, breaking the moment with clinical efficiency. "Device One is confirmed at the financial district target. Device Two is confirmed at a secondary location in the Mission District. We will be landing at San Francisco International Airport in approximately eleven minutes."

> "SFO?" Hartfield's voice was sharp, cutting through the awe. "You can't just land a—whatever the hell this is—at a commercial airport."

> "San Francisco International is currently experiencing a major equipment failure," Shade replied, its tone utterly neutral. "All air traffic control systems are non-operational. No flights are being conducted at this time."

There was a beat of silence.

> "Did *you* do that?" Martinez asked, his voice sharp.

> "I respectfully decline to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me," Shade said, maintaining the same clinical tone.

> "You crashed an entire airport?" Martinez's voice cracked slightly on the last word.

> "I initiated a comprehensive but temporary systems disruption that will be attributed to a software cascade failure," Shade corrected. "No aircraft are at risk. All active flights have been diverted to alternate airports. The disruption will resolve itself approximately forty-seven minutes after we depart the area."

LeBouf finally opened his eyes, though he kept them carefully fixed on the cabin ceiling, avoiding the viewport.

> "Once we land, the two teams will split," he said, his voice steady now, back to business. "My team takes the financial district. Your team takes the Mission. Shade has two vehicles in the cargo bay—Q-cars. They look like civilian vehicles but they are not. Shade will be controlling the San Francisco traffic control grid to clear our path."

> "Q-cars," Marisa repeated. "As in James Bond."

> "Actually, they're named after the Q-ships from World War Two," LeBouf said. "Wolves in sheep's clothing. Armed merchant vessels disguised as easy targets. The name fits—civilian appearance, military capability. They're fast, they're armored, and they have countermeasures. You won't need to drive—Shade will handle that. Your job is to get to the target, neutralize any threats, and secure the EMP device before it can be activated."

> "And if it activates before we get there?" Hartfield asked.

> "Then millions of people lose power, thousands die from infrastructure collapse, and we have a much larger problem," LeBouf said flatly. "So we don't let that happen."

Rodriguez groaned, his head lifting slowly from his chest. His voice came out slurred, confused.

> "Did I... did I die?"

> "No," Martinez said, his own voice not much steadier. "But you might wish you had."

> "All personnel, secure for reentry," Shade announced. "We will begin deceleration in sixty seconds. G-forces will peak at four point one gravities. Duration: approximately six minutes. Consciousness should be maintained throughout. Probably."

> "Probably?" Marisa's stomach dropped, and not from the zero gravity.

> "Reentry is less traumatic than launch," LeBouf said, though his hands were already gripping his restraints tighter. "The deceleration is more gradual. You'll stay conscious. It just... it's not pleasant."

> "None of this is pleasant," Hartfield muttered.

The viewport showed the Earth beginning to rotate slowly as Shade adjusted its attitude for reentry. The Pacific Ocean was visible now, a vast expanse of blue-gray dotted with clouds. Somewhere down there, San Francisco waited. And two EMP devices were counting down to detonation.

Marisa took one last look at the view—the curvature of the Earth, the thin blue line of atmosphere, the black of space above—and tried to commit it to memory. If she survived the next hour, if she survived whatever the hell the FBI was going to do when they found out about all of this, she wanted to remember what it felt like to see the world from here. To understand, even if only for a few minutes, how small and how vast everything really was.

> "Thirty seconds to reentry interface," Shade announced. "All systems nominal. Adaptive thermal protection active. Beginning orientation burn."

There was a brief pulse of acceleration, just enough to shift Marisa's stomach, as Shade fired its maneuvering thrusters. The craft rotated smoothly, nose angling down toward the atmosphere below. Through the viewport, the Earth seemed to rise up to meet them.

> "Ten seconds. Brace for deceleration."

LeBouf's eyes were closed again, his jaw set. Across from Marisa, Hartfield was staring at the viewport with an expression somewhere between determination and barely controlled terror. Martinez and Rodriguez looked like they were reconsidering every life choice that had led them to this moment.

> "Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One. Reentry interface."

The universe caught fire.

---

The deceleration was different from launch, but no less brutal. Instead of being crushed into the seat by acceleration, Marisa felt herself pushed forward against the restraints as Shade fought against the atmosphere to slow down. The g-forces built gradually, relentlessly, pressing on her chest and shoulders like a steadily increasing weight.

Through the viewport, she could see the glow—a brilliant orange-white aura that surrounded the craft as friction heated the air to plasma temperatures. The adaptive panels on Shade's hull were managing the thermal load, redirecting heat away from critical structures, but the light was still intense enough to wash out everything else.

> "Four gravities," Shade announced. "All systems nominal. Current altitude sixty-two thousand feet, descending."

Marisa's breathing came in short, controlled gasps. Her ribs ached from the pressure. Across from her, Hartfield's face was pale, his jaw clenched, but his eyes were open and focused. Martinez and Rodriguez looked worse, but they were conscious, which was apparently better than expected.

LeBouf's voice came through the comm, tight but steady.

> "Halfway through. You're doing fine. Just keep breathing."

The glow outside the viewport began to fade as Shade descended into thicker atmosphere and its velocity dropped below the point where air compressed into plasma. The view changed from orange fire to clouds rushing past at impossible speeds, then blue sky, then the first hints of landscape below.

> "Two gravities. Thirty thousand feet."

The pressure eased. Marisa could breathe normally again. Her body still felt heavy, compressed, but it was manageable. She could move her arms, turn her head.

> "Subsonic. Fifteen thousand feet. Final approach to San Francisco International."

The viewport showed the San Francisco Bay spreading out below them, the city rising on hills to the north, the airport visible as a complex of runways jutting out into the water. Even from this altitude, Marisa could see that something was wrong. No aircraft were moving. The control tower was dark. The entire facility looked frozen, suspended in an artificial stasis.

> "Cloaking system active," Shade announced. "Landing configuration. Gear down."

There was a soft mechanical sound as the landing gear extended. Through the viewport, the airport grew larger, individual buildings becoming distinct. Shade was descending fast, too fast, but the deceleration felt controlled, purposeful.

> "Three thousand feet. Two thousand. One thousand."

The ground rushed up. Marisa's stomach lurched. Then, with barely a whisper of contact, Shade touched down on the tarmac near a service gate on the airport's eastern perimeter. The craft rolled forward for a few seconds, then stopped.

> "Landing complete," Shade said. "San Francisco International Airport. Local time twenty-two forty-three. All personnel may release restraints."

The restraints retracted automatically, flowing back into the seats. Marisa's mask unsealed with a soft hiss, lifting away from her face. She took a breath of normal air and realized her hands were shaking.

They'd just gone to space. They'd crossed the continent in twenty-three minutes. And now they were in San Francisco, invisible, at a crippled international airport, about to stop two EMP devices from destroying the city.

LeBouf was already out of his seat, moving toward the aft section of the cabin where a door was sliding open to reveal what must be the cargo bay. The two other ESF operators followed him, their movements crisp and professional despite having just experienced the same brutal flight.

> "FBI team, with me," LeBouf called. "Let's move. Your clock is already running."

Marisa unbuckled and stood, her legs wobbling slightly. Hartfield was beside her, Martinez and Rodriguez pulling themselves up. They followed LeBouf into the cargo bay, and Marisa stopped short.

The bay was larger than she'd expected, the ceiling higher, and sitting on the deck were two vehicles that looked like they'd just driven off a rental car lot. One was a dark blue Toyota Camry. The other was a silver Honda Accord. Completely ordinary. Completely unremarkable. The kind of cars you'd see in any airport parking lot and forget immediately.

Except for the way they sat on their suspension, just slightly too low and stable. Except for the way the paint seemed just a shade too matte, too perfect. Except for the fact that they were sitting inside a spacecraft that had just returned from the edge of space.

LeBouf gestured to the Honda.

> "That's yours. Shade will drive. Your target is in the Mission District, nineteen minutes away at normal speeds. Shade will get you there in eight. Get in."

The ramp was already extending, lowering toward the tarmac. The harsh glow of airport lighting spilled in, along with the smell of jet fuel and the distant sound of confused voices from the terminal buildings.

Marisa and her team moved to the Honda. The doors were unlocked, opening with a soft click that sounded too normal for what it was. She climbed into the front passenger seat. Hartfield took the back left, Rodriguez the back right, Martinez the seat behind her.

The interior looked normal. Gray cloth seats. Plastic dashboard. Cup holders. A touchscreen infotainment system. Everything completely ordinary, except—

Marisa's eye caught something on the windshield. At first she thought it was a reflection, but then she realized it was information, projected directly onto the glass. A heads-up display, showing what looked like a minimap of San Francisco's street grid in the corner, along with text readouts for speed, distance, and a countdown timer.

37:12
37:11
37:10

Thirty-seven minutes. That's how long they had before the EMP devices activated.

> "Shade?" Hartfield's voice was uncertain from the back seat.

> "I am here, Agent Hartfield," the AI replied, its voice now coming from the car's speakers. "Please secure your seatbelts. Departure in ten seconds."

The engine started. Or at least, Marisa assumed it did—there was barely any sound, just a soft hum that felt more like an electric motor than a conventional engine. The Honda rolled down the ramp, tires touching the tarmac with a soft thump.

The moment they cleared the spacecraft, Marisa looked back and saw nothing. The ramp was retracting, but Shade itself was invisible, a perfect void in the morning light. Then even the ramp disappeared, and there was just empty tarmac.

The Honda accelerated smoothly, heading toward the service gate. As they approached, the barrier lifted on its own, the automated system responding to commands it shouldn't be able to receive. They passed through onto the access road, and suddenly they were just another car in San Francisco, completely invisible in the most important way—by being exactly what everyone expected to see.

On the windshield, a glowing blue line appeared, overlaid on the street ahead, showing their route like something out of a video game. It curved left, toward the airport exit, then merged onto the highway heading north into the city.

> "Following optimal route to target," Shade announced. "Traffic control systems have been accessed. All signals will be synchronized for our passage. Estimated time to destination: eight minutes, twelve seconds."

The Honda accelerated, smoothly but insistently. Marisa watched the speedometer climb—forty, fifty, sixty miles per hour, and they were still in the airport access road. The ride was glass-smooth, no vibration, no road noise, nothing that suggested they were in a car that probably cost twenty-five thousand dollars new.

They merged onto Highway 101, and the Honda accelerated harder. Seventy. Eighty. Ninety.

> "Jesus Christ," Rodriguez breathed from the back seat. "This is not a Honda."

> "Wolf in sheep's clothing," Hartfield muttered.

The car handled like it was on rails. Every curve, every lane change, executed with precision that no human driver could match. Traffic was lighter than usual for the late hour, and the synchronized traffic signals were clearing their path, but the Honda was weaving through lanes with aggressive precision, moving at speeds no one would expect from a rental-grade sedan.

Marisa kept her eyes on the heads-up display. The blue line showing their route curved and branched, anticipating every turn. The countdown timer ticked steadily downward.

35:47
35:46
35:45

Ahead, a traffic light turned green just as they approached. Then another. Then another. The entire city's traffic control system was bending itself around their path, clearing the way, making them invisible not through technology but through perfection—by being exactly where they needed to be, exactly when they needed to be there, never quite breaking enough laws to be noticed but never slowing down.

The Honda took an exit, banking smoothly onto a surface street. The neighborhood changed from industrial to residential. The Mission District. Somewhere in these streets, hidden in a building that looked like every other building, was a nuclear EMP device counting down to detonation.

And they had thirty-five minutes to find it.
