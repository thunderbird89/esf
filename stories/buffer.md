## Chapter 5: Homecoming

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas brought his Talon through Galileo Station's docking bay entrance on manual control, his hands moving across the interface with the practiced precision that came from thousands of hours of training. But his fingers felt numb, his reactions just slightly delayed, his entire body heavy with exhaustion that went bone-deep.

The docking computer had offered to take over the approach sequence. Miguel had declined. After nearly four hours strapped into this cockpit, fighting for his life and everyone else's, he wanted to land the fighter himself. Needed to.

The Talon settled onto its designated pad with a barely perceptible thump, magnetic clamps engaging, power systems automatically cycling down to standby. Miguel's hands stayed on the controls for a moment, not quite ready to let go, not quite ready to accept that it was really over.

Then he reached up and initiated the canopy release.

The seal broke with a hiss of equalizing pressure. The canopy rose, and Miguel was suddenly hit with the smell of the docking bay—coolant, hydraulic fluid, hot metal, the recycled air of a space station that had just spent hours under siege. It smelled real in a way that his cockpit's filtered atmosphere hadn't.

He pulled off his helmet, running a hand through sweat-soaked hair, and started the process of disconnecting from the Talon's systems. Umbilicals, data links, the restraint harness that had kept him locked in place through hours of high-G maneuvers. Each connection separated with mechanical clicks that sounded too normal, too mundane for what they'd just survived.

Miguel tried to stand and nearly fell.

His legs didn't want to work properly. Four hours in the cockpit, muscles tensed for combat, adrenaline draining away now that the threat was gone. He grabbed the cockpit edge for support, forcing his legs to remember how standing worked.

Around him, the docking bay was filling with Talons. Portuguese, American, Japanese, and Federation fighters settling onto their pads in sequence, cockpits opening, pilots extracting themselves with varying degrees of difficulty. Ground crews were already moving between the fighters, running diagnostics, checking for damage, beginning the process of refueling and rearming.

Miguel climbed down from his Talon's side, using the maintenance ladder, taking it one rung at a time. His flight suit was soaked through with sweat, uncomfortable against his skin, but that discomfort was distant, abstract. Everything felt distant right now.

He reached the deck and stood there for a moment, just breathing, trying to process that he was alive, that they'd won, that Earth was safe.

> "Freitas."

Miguel turned to see Captain Ramos approaching, the Delta Lead also looking like he'd just survived the longest four hours of his life. His flight suit was in the same state as Miguel's, his face showing the same exhaustion.

> "Sir."

> "You did good work out there. That first bomber kill probably saved the station."

Miguel managed a tired smile.

> "We all did good work, sir. We're still here."

Ramos nodded, then clapped Miguel on the shoulder.

> "Get yourself to the debriefing area. Medical check first, then they'll want to talk to us about what happened out there."

> "Yes, sir."

Ramos moved on to check on the rest of Delta Flight, leaving Miguel standing by his Talon. He looked up at the fighter, at the scorched paint where near-misses had stressed the shields, at the empty weapons hardpoints that had been cycling through ammunition for hours.

They'd done it. Twenty-five Portuguese Talons had launched from this station. Twenty-two had come back.

Three empty slots that would need to be filled.

Miguel turned away from his fighter and started walking toward the debriefing area, joining the flow of other pilots making the same journey. Around him, he could hear conversations in multiple languages—Portuguese, English, Japanese, and the Federation pilots speaking English with accents he couldn't quite place.

This was the first time Earth's nations had fought together in space. The first time they'd seen each other as allies rather than competitors.

And they'd won.

Major Ellie Morse climbed out of her Talon feeling like she'd just run a marathon in full combat gear. Her legs were shaky, her shoulders ached from hours of tension, and she was pretty sure she'd sweated through every layer of her flight suit.

But she was alive. Her squadron was alive. Most of them, anyway.

She pulled off her helmet and tucked it under one arm, scanning the docking bay for her pilots. The Vipers were scattered across several pads, their Talons showing the wear of extended combat—scorched paint, depleted weapons, the general look of fighters that had been pushed to their limits.

> "Major Morse!"

One of her pilots—Jenkins, she thought, though exhaustion was making names harder to recall—was waving from across the bay. She headed in that direction, weaving between ground crews and other pilots.

The American section of the docking bay was organized chaos. Twenty Talons had launched. Eighteen had returned. The two empty pads stood out like missing teeth, their magnetic clamps idle, their approach lights dark.

Morse tried not to think about the pilots who should have been landing on those pads.

She found most of her squadron clustered near the exit to the debriefing area, pilots helping each other out of their flight gear, comparing notes on the battle, the conversations carrying that particular quality of people who'd survived something they weren't sure they'd survive.

> "Everyone accounted for?" Morse asked as she approached.

Lieutenant Weber looked up from where he was helping another pilot with a stuck harness connection.

> "Eighteen present, ma'am. Patterson and Lee..."

He didn't finish. He didn't need to. They'd all seen the icons blink out on their tactical displays. Patterson had taken concentrated fire from two destroyers. Lee's Talon had suffered a catastrophic systems failure during a high-G maneuver and had broken apart before he could eject.

> "Understood," Morse said quietly. "Medical check, then debriefing. We'll do a proper memorial later."

The pilots nodded, the exhaustion on their faces mixing with grief that they were too tired to fully process yet. That would come later, when they had time to think, time to remember.

Morse looked around the docking bay, seeing the same scene repeated across different national sections. Pilots exhausted, relieved, grieving. Ground crews working efficiently despite their own exhaustion. The organized chaos of a military unit that had just survived combat.

Her eyes caught movement near the Japanese section of the bay, and she recognized the distinctive nose art of one of the Hell Ravens' Talons. The image was striking—a grinning anime girl with raven wings spreading from her back and what looked like a nuclear cannon mounted on her right arm. The character had a determined, almost manic expression that seemed both playful and fierce.

The pilot climbing down from that particular Talon moved with the same controlled exhaustion as everyone else, but there was something in her posture that suggested she was processing the experience differently. More internally. Less visible.

Major Tanaka Utsuho, Morse recalled from the pre-mission briefings. Call sign Okuu. The Hell Ravens' commander.

Morse started walking in that direction, picking her way through the organized chaos. They'd been fighting alongside each other for hours, coordinating attacks, covering each other's approaches, operating as a unified force despite never having trained together.

Seemed like they should at least meet face-to-face.

---

Okuu stood beside her Talon, one hand resting on the fuselage, looking up at the nose art that had become something of a signature for her fighter. The maintenance crew had done excellent work recreating the character from the game she'd referenced—Utsuho Reiuji from Touhou, nuclear-powered hell raven, grinning with fierce determination and armed with impossible firepower.

It had started as a joke during training. Her instructors had pointed out the similarity between her name and the character. The nose art had followed naturally. Now, looking at it after nearly four hours of combat, it felt appropriate in ways she hadn't expected.

She'd fought with nuclear-grade determination today. They all had.

> "That's distinctive artwork."

Okuu turned to find an American pilot approaching—the insignia on her flight suit marking her as a Major. Blonde hair pulled back in a regulation bun, face showing the same exhaustion everyone was feeling, but eyes alert and assessing.

> "Major Tanaka Utsuho," Okuu said, offering a slight bow that was more reflex than conscious decision. "Hell Ravens squadron leader."

> "Major Ellie Morse, Viper Squadron. US Air Force." Morse gestured toward the nose art. "I take it there's a story behind that?"

> "Video game character. Same name, appropriate symbolism." Okuu allowed herself a small smile. "Nuclear-powered, heavily armed, never gives up. Seemed fitting."

> "After today, I'd say that's accurate." Morse looked around the docking bay, at the pilots extracting themselves from cockpits, at the ground crews already working on battle damage assessment. "Hell of a first mission for Earth's squadrons."

> "Four hours of continuous combat," Okuu said quietly. "I've done longer training exercises, but nothing like that. Nothing where the stakes were..."

She trailed off. The stakes had been everything. Earth's survival. Billions of lives. The entire human species.

> "You know what this probably qualifies for?" Morse said, her voice carrying a note of dark humor. "Longest continuous combat operation award. Four hours straight in the cockpit, no breaks, constant engagement. That's got to be some kind of record."

Okuu considered that.

> "If they're keeping records."

> "Oh, they're definitely keeping records." Morse looked toward the Federation section of the bay, where pilots in slightly different flight suits were going through the same post-flight procedures. "This was historic. First time Earth fought together in space. First time we operated alongside the Federation in actual combat. First alien invasion of the Solar System."

She paused.

> "First time we won."

The two of them stood there for a moment, letting that sink in. They'd won. Against impossible odds, against a force that should have overwhelmed them, they'd held the line long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

> "The Federation pilots," Okuu said, watching the other section of the bay. "We should meet them properly. We've been fighting alongside them, but I don't think anyone's actually introduced themselves yet."

Morse followed her gaze.

> "You're right. We've been on the same tactical net for hours, but that's not the same as actually knowing the people you're fighting beside."

Okuu pushed away from her Talon, feeling the exhaustion in her legs but refusing to acknowledge it beyond recognition. They were tired. They'd earned that. But there would be time to collapse later.

> "Let's go introduce ourselves," she said. "Before debriefing pulls us in different directions."

Morse nodded, and the two of them started walking toward the Federation section of the docking bay, where pilots were finishing their own post-flight procedures. Around them, the docking bay continued its organized chaos—ground crews, medical personnel, officers coordinating the aftermath of a battle that had ended just minutes ago.

Behind them, Okuu's Talon sat on its pad, the grinning hell raven on its nose watching over the bay with fierce determination, nuclear cannon at the ready.

The battle was over.

But the story of what they'd accomplished together was just beginning.
