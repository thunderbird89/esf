## Chapter 4: Disaster

### Tokyo Metropolitan Area
### November 18, 2026 - 1323 hours JST

Private Naoko Yoshika was reviewing training protocols when the floor began to move.

Not the gentle sway that Tokyo residents learned to ignore. This was different. The building lurched sideways, throwing her against her desk. Coffee mugs crashed to the floor. The overhead lights swung wildly on their fixtures. Someone screamed. The emergency alarms started blaring, adding their wail to the chorus of creaking steel and shattering glass.

Naoko grabbed the desk edge as the world tilted again. Earthquake drills had trained her for this—get to a doorway, protect your head, wait for it to stop. But this wasn't stopping. The shaking intensified, a deep rumbling that seemed to come from the earth itself.

Through the window, she could see buildings swaying across the street. One of the older structures was already showing cracks in its façade. Car alarms wailed in harmony with the emergency sirens. The sky had that strange, dusty quality that came from concrete and mortar being pulverized.

The shaking lasted ninety seconds. It felt like hours.

When it finally stopped, Naoko's ears rang in the sudden relative silence. Around her, the depot office was chaos—overturned furniture, shattered screens, papers strewn across the floor. But the building had held. The JSDF built to earthquake standards.

Major Tanaka's voice cut through the confusion, calm and commanding.

> "Status report. Everyone check in."

Voices called out. Some shaken, but everyone accounted for. No injuries beyond cuts and bruises.

Naoko's phone buzzed with an emergency alert. She pulled it from her pocket, hands still trembling slightly.

**MAGNITUDE 7.8 EARTHQUAKE**
**EPICENTER: TOKYO BAY**
**TSUNAMI WARNING IN EFFECT**

Her stomach dropped. Magnitude 7.8. In the bay. The coastal areas—

> "All personnel, listen up," Major Tanaka called out. "This is what we've been training for. Yoshika, Sato, Kimura—get to the hangar. We're mobilizing the Landmates."

Naoko was already moving before the order fully registered. Seven weeks. Seven weeks since the Landmates had arrived. Four weeks since the Initiative training had begun. They'd drilled for this, practiced the commands, rehearsed the deployment procedures.

But this wasn't a drill.

The depot yard was a mess of fallen equipment and cracked pavement, but the Landmates stood in their perfect formation, utterly unmoved by the earthquake that had shaken everything around them. Naoko felt a surge of something—relief? gratitude?—at the sight of those ten motionless figures.

> "Landmate units," Major Tanaka's voice carried across the yard. "Board the transport helicopters on approach. Move to the marked positions."

The Landmates moved in unison, their stride eating up ground with mechanical precision. Naoko could already hear the helicopters—three heavy cargo Chinooks coming in fast and low, their rotors beating the air.

The loading procedure they'd practiced dozens of times unfolded with smooth efficiency. Three Landmates per helicopter, walking up the rear ramps without hesitation. One unit remaining at the depot for local operations. The machines weighed tons, but the cargo helicopters were rated for them.

Naoko grabbed her gear and ran for the command vehicle. Through her radio, she could hear the emergency channels lighting up. Reports flooding in from across Tokyo. Building collapses in Shinagawa. Fires in Odaiba. The elevated expressway near Ariake had buckled. The Sumida River bridges—

She forced herself to focus. Her job was the Landmates. Get them to the disaster zone. Keep them working. Save as many people as possible.

The command vehicle lurched into motion, following the helicopters toward the smoke rising over Tokyo Bay.

### Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 1445 hours JST

The Ariake district looked like something from a war zone.

Naoko had seen earthquake damage before—cracked walls, broken windows, collapsed roofs. But this was different in scale. Entire buildings had folded in on themselves. The ground was fractured, great rifts opening in the pavement. Fires burned in at least three locations she could see. And everywhere, everywhere, there were people trapped in the rubble.

The Landmates had deployed from the helicopters with the same mechanical precision they did everything else. Drop from five meters, land with a burst of jump jets, assume formation. Now they stood in the middle of devastation, waiting for commands.

Major Tanaka was coordinating with the on-site incident commander, a fire department captain whose face was streaked with soot and whose voice carried the edge of controlled panic. Around them, first responders worked frantically—pulling at debris, calling out for survivors, setting up triage stations.

> "Yoshika," Tanaka called. "You're on Unit One. Captain Hayashi needs that residential block cleared. Four-story building, partial collapse, multiple trapped."

Naoko moved to the first Landmate, her training taking over despite the chaos around her.

> "Unit One, follow me."

The machine fell into step beside her, its three-meter frame drawing stares from the first responders as she led it toward the collapsed building. The structure had pancaked on one side, the upper floors crushing down onto the lower ones. Smoke was rising from somewhere inside—not a full fire yet, but it would be soon.

A firefighter waved her over frantically.

> "We've got at least three people in there. Ground floor, under that section." He pointed at a massive concrete slab, probably part of the second floor. "We can't lift it. We tried jacks, but it's too heavy and too unstable."

Naoko looked at the slab. It had to weigh several tons. A crane could lift it, but the nearest crane was probably dealing with a dozen other collapses, and time was everything.

She turned to the Landmate.

> "Unit One, lift that concrete slab and hold it steady."

The machine moved forward without hesitation. It positioned itself beside the slab, got its hands underneath the edge, and lifted.

The concrete rose as if it were made of foam. The Landmate held it there, perfectly still, its servos barely humming.

> "Go, go, go!" the firefighter shouted.

Rescue workers scrambled into the space beneath the slab. Naoko could hear them calling out, see movement in the darkness. Within minutes they were bringing people out—two adults, one child, all alive. Injured, but alive.

> "Clear!" someone shouted.

> "Unit One, set it down gently and step back."

The Landmate lowered the slab with the same precision it had lifted it. Not a drop, not a jolt. Just smooth, controlled movement that probably saved the lives of everyone who'd been working underneath.

The firefighter stared at the machine, then at Naoko.

> "Can it do that again?"

> "As many times as we need it to."

### Across Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 1647 hours JST

The sun was beginning its descent toward the horizon, painting the smoke-filled sky in shades of orange and amber. Across six wards of Tokyo, the Landmates worked.

In Shinagawa, Unit Two stood beside a collapsed apartment complex, its hands gripping a massive concrete support beam that had buckled during the quake. The structure above threatened to pancake further, trapping the twelve people still inside. The machine held the beam steady—tons of concrete and steel balanced perfectly motionless—while rescue workers crawled through the space beneath, calling out to survivors.

> "Hold position," the operator commanded through the radio.

The Landmate stood. Minutes passed. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. The machine's servos hummed quietly, its armor streaked with concrete dust, but it showed no sign of strain. When the last survivor was finally extracted, the operator gave the release command, and Unit Two lowered the beam with the same precision it had lifted it.

In Odaiba, Unit Five waded through water that came up to its waist—chest-high for any human. The tsunami warning had brought seawater surging into the low-lying district, flooding basements and ground floors. The Landmate moved through the murky water without hesitation, following the thermal signatures that its operator called out via radio. It reached a partially submerged car, tore the door off its hinges with one hand, and carefully extracted the elderly woman trapped inside. Then it waded back through the flood, holding her above the water line, until it reached the emergency personnel waiting on higher ground.

Across the bay in Koto, Unit Seven worked at the remains of a shopping center. The building's upper floors had collapsed onto the parking structure below, creating a maze of twisted steel and shattered concrete. Conventional equipment couldn't navigate the unstable debris field. The Landmate could.

> "Move forward ten meters, then clear the steel beams blocking the path," the operator directed.

The machine stepped carefully through the wreckage, its weight distribution perfect despite the unstable ground. It reached the obstruction—several I-beams weighing hundreds of kilograms each, tangled together—and began pulling them apart. The metal groaned and shrieked as the Landmate bent and moved steel that should have required cutting torches. Within minutes, a path opened, allowing rescue workers to reach three people who'd been trapped in a pocket beneath the debris.

Near Tokyo Station, Unit Three stood in an inferno. The office tower had caught fire after the quake ruptured a gas line, and the flames had spread to three floors. Firefighters had located two people on the fourth floor, cut off by flames on the stairwell, but couldn't reach them through the heat.

The Landmate simply walked into the building.

The operator watched through the thermal camera feed, tracking the machine's progress. The heat inside would have killed a human in seconds. The Landmate's armor glowed orange in the infrared, but it moved without hesitation, following the operator's directions up the damaged stairwell. It found the survivors huddled in an office, swept them both up in its arms, and walked back through the flames.

When it emerged, the machine's gray armor was blackened with soot and still radiating heat. But there was no damage. No melting. No compromise of its systems. It set the survivors down gently near the paramedics, turned, and stood ready for the next command.

In Setagaya, Unit Nine was doing something no human rescue worker could safely attempt. A gas station had collapsed, its fuel tanks ruptured but not yet ignited. The whole area reeked of gasoline. One spark would turn it into an inferno. But there were people trapped in the attached convenience store.

The Landmate walked into the gas-soaked area, located the survivors, and carried them out one by one. No sparks from its servos. No ignition source from its systems. Just careful, methodical extraction while emergency crews stood ready with foam suppressant, praying the machine's judgment was as good as the reports suggested.

It was.

As evening fell across Tokyo, the pattern repeated at site after site. Landmates lifting what couldn't be lifted. Moving through conditions where humans couldn't survive. Working without rest, without complaint, without the limitations of flesh and bone.

### JSDF Emergency Coordination Center, Ichigaya
### November 18, 2026 - 2247 hours JST

Naoko sat in the operator station, her voice hoarse from hours of giving commands. Around her, nine other operators worked their units, their voices calm despite the exhaustion that showed on their faces. The coordination center hummed with controlled urgency—status updates, deployment requests, casualty reports.

On the main display, a map of Tokyo showed the disaster response in real-time. Blue dots marked active Landmate positions. Red zones indicated fires. Orange showed structural damage. The blue dots moved steadily from site to site, never stopping, never slowing.

Major Tanaka stood at the command station, coordinating with incident commanders across the affected areas.

> "Unit Six, relocate to Minato. Collapsed bridge, multiple vehicles trapped underneath."

> "Unit Four, Shibuya needs heavy lift support. Office building threatening to collapse onto evacuation route."

> "Unit Eight, stand by. We're getting reports of a gas leak in your area. May need you for hazardous environment extraction."

Naoko checked her status board. Unit One had been operational for nine hours straight. No performance degradation. No maintenance required. The machine was currently holding up a damaged highway overpass while engineers assessed whether it could be stabilized or needed controlled demolition.

Her radio crackled.

> "This is Fire Command Sector Seven. We need Unit One at a school collapse in Toyosu. Three-story building. We have confirmed signs of life but can't reach them safely."

Naoko felt her exhaustion evaporate.

> "Understood, Command. Redirecting now."

She keyed her command frequency.

> "Unit One, current task complete?"

A moment's pause while the engineers on site confirmed. Then: "Structure secured. Unit cleared for redeployment."

> "Unit One, proceed to evacuation vehicle at your location. You're being relocated to Toyosu."

On her screen, the blue dot began moving.

Naoko glanced at the clock. Almost eleven at night. The Landmates had been working for over eight hours. Conventional equipment would need refueling, maintenance, operator rotation. The Landmates just kept going.

Major Tanaka appeared beside her station.

> "Status?"

> "All units operational. No failures, no degradation. They're performing beyond spec, sir."

> "I know. Command is already drafting reports for the UN Initiative." He paused, looking at the map. "Yoshika, preliminary casualty estimates are coming in. We're looking at just over four hundred dead."

Naoko felt the weight of that number.

> "That's... that's still so many."

> "The models predicted over a thousand by now." Tanaka's voice was quiet. "The Landmates aren't magic. They can't prevent an earthquake or undo the damage. But they're making a difference. A significant one."

On the main display, the blue dots continued their tireless work across the darkened city. Nine machines deployed, one held in reserve, all of them working alongside thousands of human first responders.

Naoko looked at her status board, at the simple readouts that showed Unit One approaching the collapsed school in Toyosu.

> "Unit One, you're approaching the site. Prepare for heavy lift and precision extraction. There are children in there."

The radio crackled with acknowledgment—not words, the Landmates didn't speak—but a subtle shift in the unit's readiness state that her interface detected.

She leaned forward, focused on her screens, ready to guide the machine through whatever came next.

Outside, Tokyo burned and shook and struggled to save itself.

And the Landmates, tireless and precise, continued helping however they were commanded.

### Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 2301 hours JST

The aftershock hit without warning.

Naoko was outside the coordination vehicle, stretching her legs during a brief lull in deployments, when the ground lurched beneath her feet. Not as violent as the initial quake, but violent enough. The pavement cracked with sounds like gunshots. The coordination vehicle rocked on its suspension. Someone inside shouted a warning.

Then the building beside her—already damaged, already compromised—began to collapse.

Naoko ran. Debris crashed behind her, dust billowing through the street. She heard voices shouting, the screech of twisting metal, the thunder of concrete hitting asphalt. Her radio was screaming with traffic—multiple reports, new collapses, the organized chaos of disaster response suddenly thrown back into crisis.

She rounded a corner, coughing in the dust cloud, trying to orient herself. The street lights were out. Emergency lights strobed in the distance. She'd been separated from the coordination center, from her team, from—

A shape loomed through the dust. Three meters tall. Motionless.

A Landmate.

Naoko stumbled toward it, relief flooding through her. One of their units, standing in the middle of the street. Unit Six, if she remembered the deployment map correctly. Its armor was covered in concrete dust, but it stood perfectly still, waiting.

She grabbed her radio.

> "This is Operator Yoshika. I'm separated from the coordination center, I have visual on Unit Six. Requesting connection to command frequency."

Static. The aftershock must have disrupted communications. She tried again, got the same result.

Behind her, she could hear screaming. The collapse had trapped people. First responders were calling for help, for equipment, for anything that could lift the debris.

Naoko looked up at the Landmate.

> "Unit Six, respond to voice command. Acknowledge."

The machine stood motionless.

Right. Without the radio link, without the command frequency, it wouldn't respond to her voice alone. The units were keyed to their assigned operators through the coordination system. She wasn't Unit Six's operator. She couldn't just—

More screaming. Someone was trapped. Someone was dying while she stood here with a perfectly functional rescue machine that wouldn't listen to her.

> "Move!" she shouted at it. "People need help! Unit Six, move!"

Nothing.

Frustration boiled over into desperation. Naoko slammed her fists against the Landmate's chest armor, the impacts sending sharp pain through her hands but not even marking the machine's surface.

> "Move, damn you! We have to help!"

The Landmate stood silent.

Naoko hit it again, and again, her hands throbbing, her throat raw from shouting. Nine hours of coordinating rescues, of watching these machines save lives, and now when she needed one—when people were dying just meters away—it stood there like a statue, like it had for those first three weeks after delivery.

She drew back her fist for another futile strike.

Then the Landmate's chest opened.

Naoko froze.

The armor plates split along seams she'd never noticed before. Two panels folded upward, two downward, revealing an interior space that glowed with soft amber light. Inside was a seat—not mechanical, but curved and padded, almost organically shaped to fit a human form. And around it, a framework of something that looked like metal and carbon fiber woven together, skeletal and precise, with attachment points at shoulders, waist, wrists, and ankles.

A harness.

A cockpit.

Naoko stared at the open chest cavity, at the seat waiting inside, at the harness that looked designed to hold a human body.

All this time. Seven weeks of voice commands, of radio frequencies, of treating these machines like remote-controlled equipment.

And they'd been designed to be piloted.

Her radio crackled back to life.

> "—shika, respond. Yoshika, what's your status?"

But Naoko couldn't answer. She stood in the dusty Tokyo street, staring at the open Landmate, at the invitation it offered, while somewhere behind her people screamed for help she didn't know how to give.

The amber light inside the cockpit pulsed gently, waiting.

Naoko had read Appleseed cover to cover. Multiple times. She'd watched the anime adaptations, studied the technical diagrams that Shirow had lovingly detailed in the margins. She recognized this. The seat. The harness. The cybernetic interface between human and machine.

A landmate. Not in name only, but in function. An exoskeleton amplifier. A human-machine hybrid.

She didn't think. Didn't calculate the risks or consider the consequences. People were dying. The machine was waiting. And she knew—she knew—what this meant.

Naoko grabbed the chest armor's edge and pulled herself up.

The Landmate's frame provided handholds she hadn't noticed before, subtle recesses in the armor that her fingers found instinctively. She climbed into the cockpit, swung her legs over the seat's edge, and—

The harness moved.

Metal bands erupted from the seat's sides like living things, snaking around her ankles with mechanical precision. She felt them wrap, tighten, lock into place with soft clicks that reverberated through the frame. Before she could react, more bands shot up from the seat itself, coiling around her thighs, her hips, each one constricting with enough force to hold her but not quite enough to hurt.

> "No! Wait—"

Struts extended from the seat back, lying flat against her arms. She tried to pull away, but the leg restraints held her in place. The struts pressed against her forearms, her upper arms, conforming to the shape of her limbs with disturbing accuracy. Bands wrapped around her wrists, her elbows, her shoulders—not tight enough to cut off circulation, but secure enough that she couldn't move.

> "No, no, no, no!!"

Belts shot out from the seat's sides, crossing over her chest in an X-pattern, then wrapping around her waist. They pulled taut, pressing her back firmly into the seat. She tried to struggle, but the harness had already immobilized her limbs. More bands secured her hips, her lower back, every major joint locked into position.

Then something cold touched the back of her head.

Metallic pressure points made contact with her skull—behind her ears, at the base of her neck, along the sides of her head above her temples. She felt the structure closing around her like a crown, or a cage, each contact point pressing with gentle but inexorable force. Not painful, but present. Undeniable. Something that felt like it was reading her, mapping her, connecting to her in ways she didn't understand.

> "Stop! Please, I don't—"

The chest panels began to close.

Amber light gave way to shadow as the armor plates swung shut with mechanical certainty. Two panels from above, two from below, sealing with the same precise clicks she'd heard from the restraints. The last sliver of dusty Tokyo street disappeared as the panels met, merged, became seamless.

Darkness.

Complete, absolute darkness.

Naoko's breathing came in short, sharp gasps. The harness held her immobile, the struts against her limbs preventing even the smallest movement. The metallic structure around her head felt like it was tightening, though rationally she knew it wasn't. The seat cradled her body in a grip that was almost gentle but absolutely unyielding.

She'd climbed into a three-meter-tall machine that she didn't know how to operate, that no one had trained her to use, that might not even be designed for someone of her size or physiology. She was trapped inside a Federation creation that had just sealed her in its chest cavity, restrained her with bands she couldn't break, and was now doing something to her head that she couldn't see or understand.

The screaming outside was muffled now, distant through layers of armor that could withstand fire and crushing force.

What had she been thinking? That she'd just climb in and know how to use it? That it would somehow be intuitive, like in the manga? That the desperate situation would somehow make her compatible with technology decades beyond anything Earth could produce?

She'd made a mistake. A terrible, impulsive mistake driven by nine hours of exhaustion and the sound of people dying in the rubble behind her.

And now she was locked inside a machine she couldn't control, couldn't escape, couldn't—
