## Chapter 4: Disaster

### Tokyo Metropolitan Area

Private Naoko Yoshika was reviewing training protocols when the floor began to move.

Not the gentle sway that Tokyo residents learned to ignore. This was different. The building lurched sideways, throwing her against her desk. Coffee mugs crashed to the floor. The overhead lights swung wildly on their fixtures. Someone screamed. The emergency alarms started blaring, adding their wail to the chorus of creaking steel and shattering glass.

Naoko grabbed the desk edge as the world tilted again. Earthquake drills had trained her for this—get to a doorway, protect your head, wait for it to stop. But this wasn't stopping. The shaking intensified, a deep rumbling that seemed to come from the earth itself.

Through the window, she could see buildings swaying across the street. One of the older structures was already showing cracks in its façade. Car alarms wailed in harmony with the emergency sirens. The sky had that strange, dusty quality that came from concrete and mortar being pulverized.

The shaking lasted ninety seconds. It felt like hours.

When it finally stopped, Naoko's ears rang in the sudden relative silence. Around her, the depot office was chaos—overturned furniture, shattered screens, papers strewn across the floor. But the building had held. The JSDF built to earthquake standards.

Major Tanaka's voice cut through the confusion, calm and commanding.

> "Status report. Everyone check in."

Voices called out. Some shaken, but everyone accounted for. No injuries beyond cuts and bruises.

Naoko's phone buzzed with an emergency alert. She pulled it from her pocket, hands still trembling slightly.

**MAGNITUDE 7.8 EARTHQUAKE**
**EPICENTER: TOKYO BAY**
**TSUNAMI WARNING IN EFFECT**

Her stomach dropped. Magnitude 7.8. In the bay. That meant the coastal areas would be—

> "All personnel, listen up," Major Tanaka called out. "This is what we've been training for. Yoshika, Sato, Kimura—get to the hangar. We're mobilizing the Landmates."

Naoko was already moving before the order fully registered. Seven weeks. Seven weeks since the Landmates had arrived. Four weeks since the Initiative training had begun. They'd drilled for this, practiced the commands, rehearsed the deployment procedures.

But this wasn't a drill.

The depot yard was a mess of fallen equipment and cracked pavement, but the Landmates stood in their perfect formation, utterly unmoved by the earthquake that had shaken everything around them. Naoko felt a surge of something—relief? gratitude?—at the sight of those ten motionless figures.

> "Landmate units," Major Tanaka's voice carried across the yard. "Board the transport helicopters on approach. Move to the marked positions."

The Landmates moved in unison, their stride eating up ground with mechanical precision. Naoko could already hear the helicopters—four heavy cargo Chinooks coming in fast and low, their rotors beating the air.

The loading procedure they'd practiced dozens of times unfolded with smooth efficiency. Two Landmates per helicopter, walking up the rear ramps without hesitation. The machines weighed tons, but the cargo helicopters were rated for them. Barely.

Naoko grabbed her gear and ran for the command vehicle. Through her radio, she could hear the emergency channels lighting up. Reports flooding in from across Tokyo. Building collapses in Shinagawa. Fires in Odaiba. The elevated expressway near Ariake had buckled. The Sumida River bridges—

She forced herself to focus. Her job was the Landmates. Get them to the disaster zone. Keep them working. Save as many people as possible.

The command vehicle lurched into motion, following the helicopters toward the smoke rising over Tokyo Bay.

### Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 1523 hours JST

The Ariake district looked like something from a war zone.

Naoko had seen earthquake damage before—cracked walls, broken windows, collapsed roofs. But this was different in scale. Entire buildings had folded in on themselves. The ground was fractured, great rifts opening in the pavement. Fires burned in at least three locations she could see. And everywhere, everywhere, there were people trapped in the rubble.

The Landmates had deployed from the helicopters with the same mechanical precision they did everything else. Drop from five meters, land with a burst of jump jets, assume formation. Now they stood in the middle of devastation, waiting for commands.

Major Tanaka was coordinating with the on-site incident commander, a fire department captain whose face was streaked with soot and whose voice carried the edge of controlled panic. Around them, first responders worked frantically—pulling at debris, calling out for survivors, setting up triage stations.

> "Yoshika," Tanaka called. "You're on Unit One. Captain Hayashi needs that residential block cleared. Four-story building, partial collapse, multiple trapped."

Naoko moved to the first Landmate, her training taking over despite the chaos around her.

> "Unit One, follow me."

The machine fell into step beside her, its three-meter frame drawing stares from the first responders as she led it toward the collapsed building. The structure had pancaked on one side, the upper floors crushing down onto the lower ones. Smoke was rising from somewhere inside—not a full fire yet, but it would be soon.

A firefighter waved her over frantically.

> "We've got at least three people in there. Ground floor, under that section." He pointed at a massive concrete slab, probably part of the second floor. "We can't lift it. We tried jacks, but it's too heavy and too unstable."

Naoko looked at the slab. It had to weigh several tons. A crane could lift it, but the nearest crane was probably dealing with a dozen other collapses, and time was everything.

She turned to the Landmate.

> "Unit One, lift that concrete slab and hold it steady."

The machine moved forward without hesitation. It positioned itself beside the slab, got its hands underneath the edge, and lifted.

The concrete rose as if it were made of foam. The Landmate held it there, perfectly still, its servos barely humming.

> "Go, go, go!" the firefighter shouted.

Rescue workers scrambled into the space beneath the slab. Naoko could hear them calling out, see movement in the darkness. Within minutes they were bringing people out—two adults, one child, all alive. Injured, but alive.

> "Clear!" someone shouted.

> "Unit One, set it down gently and step back."

The Landmate lowered the slab with the same precision it had lifted it. Not a drop, not a jolt. Just smooth, controlled movement that probably saved the lives of everyone who'd been working underneath.

The firefighter stared at the machine, then at Naoko.

> "Can it do that again?"

> "As many times as we need it to."

By 1600 hours, Unit One had cleared six collapse sites. Unit Two was pulling apart a crushed vehicle to reach the driver inside. Unit Three was holding up a dangerously tilted wall while evacuees were brought out of the building behind it.

The Landmates worked without pause, without fatigue. They lifted weights that would require industrial equipment. They moved through spaces too dangerous for humans. When the fire in the residential block flared up, threatening to engulf an apartment where survivors were trapped, Unit Four simply walked through the flames.

Naoko watched on the video feed as the Landmate emerged from the inferno carrying two unconscious people, its armor blackened by soot but completely undamaged. It set them down gently near the paramedics, then turned and walked back into the fire to search for more.

> "Yoshika," Tanaka's voice came through her radio. "Status on your units?"

> "All operational. No signs of fatigue or damage. They're... sir, they're incredible. They just keep working."

> "Same report from all operators. We've got requests for Landmates from fifteen different sites. We need to prioritize."

Naoko looked around at the devastation. Fifteen sites. They had ten Landmates. And this was just one district of Tokyo.

> "Where do you need us, sir?"

> "There's a school in Toyosu. Three-story building, complete collapse. They think there are at least twenty children still inside."

Naoko felt her throat tighten.

> "Understood. Unit One, on me. We're relocating."

The Landmate fell into step beside her as she headed for the command vehicle. Around them, the sun was beginning to set, painting the smoke-filled sky in shades of orange and red.

The disaster was far from over.

But for the first time since the earthquake hit, Naoko felt something other than fear.

Hope.

### National Diet Building, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 2134 hours JST

Prime Minister Ishikawa stood in the emergency operations center, watching the map of Tokyo light up with incident reports. The room hummed with controlled urgency—officials coordinating response efforts, screens showing live feeds from across the affected areas, voices calling out updates every few minutes.

The numbers were still coming in, but they painted a grim picture. Magnitude 7.8. Hundreds dead. Thousands injured. Tens of thousands displaced. Infrastructure damage across six wards. Multiple fires still burning. And the aftershocks kept coming, each one threatening to bring down structures already weakened by the initial quake.

But there was something else in the data. Something that didn't fit the expected pattern of disaster response.

Minister of Defense Takeda stood beside him, reviewing a tablet.

> "Prime Minister, the Landmate deployment reports are remarkable."

Ishikawa turned from the map.

> "Remarkable how?"

> "In the past six hours, our ten Landmates have been involved in rescue operations at forty-three separate sites. They've extracted over two hundred survivors from collapsed structures. They've cleared debris that would have taken conventional equipment days to move. And they've done it all without rest, without equipment failures, without any of the limitations we'd normally face."

Takeda pulled up a video feed. A Landmate walking calmly through a burning building, emerging with survivors. Another lifting a collapsed wall that had trapped an entire family. A third working steadily to clear rubble while firefighters directed it with hand signals.

> "The Self-Defense Force has never had anything like this. Nothing close. These machines are force multipliers in a way I'm not sure we fully appreciated until now."

Ishikawa watched the footage. The Landmates moved with purpose, with precision, with an efficiency that seemed almost unnatural compared to the organized chaos of human rescue workers around them.

> "Casualties?"

> "Current estimate is three hundred and forty-seven dead, with that number expected to rise. But Prime Minister..." Takeda hesitated. "The models we ran after the earthquake hit suggested we'd be looking at over a thousand deaths by now. The Landmates are making a difference. A significant one."

Ishikawa nodded slowly. Seven weeks ago, he'd voted to accept `HARBINGER`'s offer with a mixture of desperation and doubt. Japan needed earthquake response capabilities. The Landmates had seemed like either a gift or a curse, and he hadn't been sure which.

Now, watching those machines work tirelessly through the Tokyo night, pulling people from rubble while fires raged and aftershocks rattled the city, he knew which it was.

> "Continue coordinating with the operators. I want those Landmates deployed wherever they're needed most. And Takeda..."

> "Yes, Prime Minister?"

> "Draft a message to the United Nations. Specifically to the International Landmate Coordination Initiative. Other nations need to know what these machines can do when disaster strikes. Not speculation, not theory. Real-world performance data."

> "I'll have it ready within the hour."

Ishikawa turned back to the map. The red indicators showed fire. Orange showed structural damage. Blue showed active rescue operations. And wherever those blue indicators appeared, small icons marked the positions of deployed Landmates.

Ten machines. Ten tireless, precise, nearly indestructible machines working alongside six thousand human first responders.

`HARBINGER` had called them helpers.

Tonight, as Tokyo burned and shook and struggled to save itself, that name felt like an understatement.

### BBC World News, London

The BBC breaking news banner had been running for nine hours. Sophie Raworth looked exhausted, but her voice remained steady as she updated viewers on the developing situation.

> "It is now just past 11:45 AM in Tokyo, seventeen hours since the magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the Kanto region. The death toll stands at four hundred and twelve, with over three thousand injured. But as rescue operations continue through a second night, one element of the response has captured international attention."

The screen cut to footage from Tokyo. Landmates working in the rubble, their gray frames visible through the smoke and dust. One was pulling apart a collapsed parking structure with its bare hands. Another was holding up a tilted building while evacuees streamed out beneath it.

> "Japan's ten Landmates, deployed within an hour of the earthquake, have been credited with saving hundreds of lives. The machines have worked without pause for over seventeen hours, moving through conditions too dangerous for human rescue workers and lifting debris that would normally require heavy equipment."

Sophie turned to address a different camera.

> "Joining us now is Professor David Walsh from Imperial College London, who has been analyzing the Landmate deployment. Professor, you were skeptical about these machines when they first arrived. What's your assessment now?"

Walsh appeared on a split screen, his earlier skepticism replaced by something harder to define.

> "Sophie, I'll admit I was wrong to doubt their utility. What we're seeing in Tokyo is unprecedented. These machines have operated continuously in extreme conditions—fires, structural instability, toxic smoke—without any degradation in performance. They've lifted loads that would require mobile cranes. They've executed complex rescue operations with precision that rivals experienced emergency teams. And they've done it all under the direction of operators who, until a month ago, had never commanded anything like this."

> "There are reports of Landmates walking through fires to reach trapped survivors."

> "Yes, and emerging completely undamaged. Whatever armor system they use, it's far beyond anything in our material science. The heat that would melt steel apparently has no effect on them whatsoever."

Sophie nodded.

> "We're also hearing that other nations are watching this deployment closely. Have we learned something fundamental about the Landmates' capabilities?"

> "Absolutely. Tokyo is providing what amounts to a real-world stress test under the worst possible conditions. Every nation that accepted Landmates is undoubtedly taking notes. We're seeing proof of concept—these machines can do exactly what `HARBINGER` promised they'd do. Save lives in disasters that would overwhelm conventional response capabilities."

The screen showed more footage. A Landmate gently setting down a survivor it had just extracted from a collapsed school. Firefighters directing another unit toward a burning apartment complex. A third standing perfectly still while engineers secured a damaged support beam beside it.

> "The Japanese government has released preliminary data suggesting the Landmates may have prevented several hundred additional deaths. That's not just impressive, Sophie. That's transformative. If these machines can perform like this consistently, they represent the most significant advancement in disaster response since the invention of the search-and-rescue dog."

> "Strong words, Professor."

> "We're watching strong evidence. I was skeptical because I didn't understand what we were dealing with. Tokyo is teaching us very quickly."

Sophie turned back to the main camera.

> "The rescue operations in Tokyo continue as we speak, with Landmates working alongside thousands of Japanese first responders. The International Landmate Coordination Initiative has scheduled an emergency meeting for tomorrow to discuss the lessons learned from this deployment. We'll continue to follow this story throughout the day."

As the broadcast moved to other coverage, the image that lingered was simple: a Landmate standing in the ruins of what had been someone's home, a firefighter beside it directing it toward the next person who needed help.

The machines `HARBINGER` had delivered were finally proving what they could do.

And the world was watching.
