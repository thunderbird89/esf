# The Helpers

## Chapter 1: The Vote

The United Nations Plenary Hall, with its domed ceiling and sweeping tiers, hummed with the routine cadence of diplomatic monotony. Delegates adjusted headsets, flipped through printed agendas, or scrolled through phones as a representative from Malta droned on about maritime waste policy. The simultaneous interpreting system clattered in its usual symphony of real-time translation—French, Arabic, Mandarin, Russian—all parsed and piped into the ears of the world’s bureaucrats.

Then, the noise broke.

A shrill burst of feedback sliced through every earpiece in the room, sharp enough to make a few delegates wince. Then—silence. Total and synchronized. The interpreters stopped mid-sentence, looking up from their booths with bewildered expressions.

A second later, the voice came. Not translated, not filtered—raw and unmistakably artificial.

> *Landmates: the mechanical soldiers you saw eight months ago in Gaza.*

A ripple went through the chamber. Heads turned. Someone near the back muttered something in Spanish. The phrase *Gaza* hung in the air like ozone. That operation had never been publicly acknowledged, and no nation had claimed credit for the towering, bipedal machines that neutralized an entire insurgent cell in under three minutes. Footage had been shaky, inconclusive. *Speculation*, the White House had said.

> *Ten of them, to be delivered to your central disaster relief depots, tomorrow.*

One of the French delegates shot to her feet. A Brazilian tapped his earpiece, trying to switch channels. Confused glances darted toward the translation booths; the interpreters inside raised their hands in surrender, mouthing *It’s not us.*

> *To be used in natural disasters, construction, or any other peaceful endeavor.*

A stir of chairs echoed as someone shouted for security—perhaps from the Ugandan delegation. But no one moved. The guards at the exits looked just as unsure. There had been no breach, no smoke, no alarms. Just a hijacked signal and a voice that came from nowhere and everywhere.

> *Say yes, and it will be yours. You have 90 seconds—cast your vote now!*

The PA system chimed. Lights along the voting display boards flared to life in rapid sequence. Above the dais, the ancient panel—a Cold War relic now digitized—blinked to red across every nameplate. Then, one by one, they turned amber, waiting.

---

The countdown began. Ninety seconds.

A pale amber glow lit each delegate’s nameplate as the system opened for input. Some delegates froze, staring wide-eyed at the panel in front of them, their fingers hovering. Others acted instantly.

The representative from Kenya jabbed the *Yes* button without hesitation. Next to her, South Africa followed suit. The Nigerian delegate paused, then pressed *Yes* with a single nod.

Eighty seconds.

Germany voted *Yes*. Then France. Spain hesitated—then confirmed. Portugal. The Netherlands. One by one, much of the EU turned amber to green.

Seventy.

Japan’s ambassador leaned in, whispered to his aide, then pressed the button himself. *Yes.* South Korea followed moments later. Singapore too. Indonesia—*Yes*. India waited. Ten seconds passed. Then: *Yes.*

Sixty.

The U.S. seat remained red for far longer than expected. The ambassador sat still, head down. Then, almost resigned, he hit *Yes*. Canada went next. Mexico too. Brazil was already green.

Fifty.

Hungary: *No.* One of the few to vote against immediately, eyes narrowed and arms crossed.

Russia’s vote came shortly after: *No.* China still hadn’t moved.

Forty.

A flurry of greens spread across Central Asia. Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan—all *Yes.* Iran stayed red.

Thirty.

The United Kingdom cast its vote. *Yes.* Ireland. Sweden. Finland. All green.

Twenty.

Ethiopia. Sudan. Colombia. *Yes, Yes, Yes.*

Ten seconds.

China voted *Yes.* A beat later, North Korea: *No.*

Five.

Ukraine: *Yes.* Belarus: *No.*

Four. Three. Two—

A final blink of color. The last vote locked in.

Then silence.

As the timer hit zero and the tally confirmed on the central board—overwhelmingly green—the voice returned. But this time, something was different. It reverberated in the marrow.

> *Thy will be done.* 

No translation followed. There was no need.

---

The chyron read: *UN Hijacked: “Landmates” Offered to World Governments*.

The anchor, Marina Okoye, was already mid-sentence as the broadcast cut in—no transition, no musical sting.

“—and with no claim of responsibility, and no traceable origin, the message delivered at the United Nations this morning has left the global intelligence community scrambling.”

Behind her, looping footage showed the inside of the UN Plenary Hall, shaky handheld shots taken from press balconies. Delegates turning. Mouths open in shock. Voting panels blinking from red to green.

“The voice, described as ‘mechanical and non-human’ by multiple delegates, interrupted all interpretation streams simultaneously. Audio engineers and technicians in Geneva have so far found no record of any intrusion into the building’s AV infrastructure.”

On-screen now: a freeze-frame of the ancient voting display as it turned green in cascade.

“Officials confirm that over a hundred and sixty countries voted *Yes* to the anonymous offer. Ten advanced mechanical units—called ‘Landmates’—are to be delivered by morning to each consenting nation’s designated disaster relief depot. The offer, if taken at face value, contains no stated conditions, no demands, and—critically—no attribution.”

The screen flicked to stock footage of Gaza, months old: a brief glimpse of a towering, humanoid silhouette striding through smoke and debris, then gone.

“Until today, sightings of these machines were dismissed by many governments as either doctored footage or experimental assets belonging to a foreign power. No nation ever claimed them. The events in Gaza were buried under diplomatic silence—until now.”

Another cut. Split-screen. Experts weighing in. A grim-faced former NATO official. A cyberwarfare analyst from MIT. Both talking over each other.

Marina returned, still composed but with a tremor beneath the surface.

“Tomorrow, the first of these machines will reportedly arrive. If that promise is kept, we may wake into a different world—one where disaster response is revolutionized… or one where sovereignty just quietly died.”

She looked directly into the camera.

“And tonight, we ask the question no one can yet answer: *who* is watching?”

---

The walls of the chamber gleamed—not polished metal, but something subtler, light-reactive, absorbing reflections into matte silence. No windows. No visible seams. Only the low hum of inertial stabilizers and the faint curve of a rotating Earth, implied by the gravity beneath their feet.

They sat around a crescent of obsidian glass—humans in silhouette, backlit only by the suspended interface of the table, its surface alive with shifting data glyphs. Above them, three translucent spheres pulsed with light, each orbiting slowly in its own pattern.

One of the spheres flickered a pale gold and spoke.

> “Geneva has concluded. Final tally: one hundred and sixty-seven affirmative. Fifteen negative. Two abstentions. Projections held within 2.3% of median forecast. Behavioral modeling confirms correlation with expectation curve sixty-two.”

A soft tone acknowledged the report.

Another sphere pulsed—a deep blue, slower, more deliberate.

> “Initial media conditioning has begun. Focus remains on humanitarian framing. Latency between visual confirmation and ideological fracture expected within margin.”

From the table, a model of Earth unfolded—highlighted nodes blooming across its surface. Relief hubs, military staging grounds, infrastructure nodes—all marked green. All verified.

A woman at the far end of the table exhaled slowly, fingertips steepled under her chin.

> “And the vectoring? No disruption?”

The gold sphere shimmered.

> “Vectors are stable. Dropships are cloaked and en route. Delivery will occur simultaneously at 0800 UTC.”

Another human—male, older, eyes hollow from long oversight—spoke without looking up.

> “Then we proceed. Phase I is authorized.”

The final sphere—crimson in hue, silent until now—dimmed in acknowledgement. The room's temperature seemed to shift subtly, as if the decision had changed the air itself.

The woman nodded once, final.

> “Let the world meet its helpers.”

## Chapter 2: Descent

### 07:59 UTC — Ramstein Air Base, Germany

The early shift in the NATO air operations center had just rotated in. Most had expected another quiet morning of tracking civilian corridors and the occasional Russian shadowplay near Kaliningrad.

But then the consoles lit up.

“Multiple bogeys inbound. Confirming... ninety-three unknowns. No transponders. No flight plans.”

The operations director leaned over the radar technician’s shoulder, eyes narrowing as the display flooded with fast-descending contacts from low orbit.

“They’re cold,” the tech added. “No heat signature, no thrust. Just—falling.”

> “Jesus. They weren’t joking.”

### 08:00 UTC — Yokota Air Base, Japan

Captain Arisaka had spent the last twenty years training for scenarios that always involved *someone*. A rogue state. A malfunctioning satellite. A meteor. Something explainable.

But this—

“All Japanese sectors are reporting identical signatures. Velocity vector confirms orbital entry. Trajectory is surgical.”

A civilian liaison from the Meteorological Agency stared at the screen in disbelief. “They’re spacing them evenly... Like relief drops.”

The captain leaned in, watching the tracking grid fill with descending markers. Each one headed for a JGSDF depot.

> “They weren’t joking,” he said quietly. “They meant every word.”

### 08:00 UTC — Brazilian Aerospace Defense Command, Brasília

The Amazon shield was lit up like it was under missile assault. But the objects weren’t behaving like missiles.

“No propulsion, no deceleration systems. Barely any radar cross-section...”

Colonel Silveira sipped his black coffee, unblinking.

“All of them are targeting our emergency logistics bases. Manaus. Porto Velho. Recife. Every one of them.”

He looked around the room. Half the junior staff were standing now, staring at the impossible feed. No one reached for a weapon. No one needed to.

> “They weren’t bluffing. Not for a second.”

And across the world, synchronized to the second, the sky delivered.

---

### 08:00 UTC — Camp Castor, Gao Region, Mali

The sky above the desert shimmered with the usual heat mirage, but the black triangle that emerged from the upper stratosphere had nothing to do with temperature.

No sonic boom. No contrail. Just an eerie silence as the dropship glided overhead, angular and matte, its form wrong in a way that cameras would never capture cleanly.

Ten hatches opened in sequence.

From each, a single figure fell—bipedal, humanoid, and impossibly compact in posture. The Landmates plummeted for nearly five seconds before their dorsal vents ignited in a staggered burst. Dust spiraled into the air as each one landed upright, metal limbs flexing to absorb the force. No tremor. No debris.

Soldiers on the tarmac stared, rifles lowered.

One technician whispered, “No parachutes?”

A UN logistics officer shook his head.

> “No need.”

### 08:00 UTC — Emergency Services Depot 3B, Hokkaido, Japan

It came in over the sea—no lights, no IFF, but its shape was unlike anything the JSDF had in inventory. A wedge-shaped carrier, gliding faster than any aircraft had business doing at that altitude.

It didn't hover. It didn’t land.

It *passed*.

Ten shapes dropped from its underbelly like silent ordnance, vanishing into the mist below. Half a second later, the fog on the mountainside ignited into ten controlled flashes. Moments after, the Landmates emerged—upright, walking, steam rising from their limbs.

Firemen and SDF personnel stared from behind the hangar fence.

> “This is real,” someone muttered. “This is actually happening.”

A nearby commander just nodded.

> “They said 0800. They meant it.”

### 08:00 UTC — FEMA Logistics Hub, Fort Worth, Texas

The dropship was visible on civilian radar for three seconds before the FAA feed went blank.

It cleared downtown without breaking a window. A featureless black hull, no markings—only the silence of engineered grace.

Ten cargo bays flared open. The Landmates dropped in a staggered formation, free-falling toward the depot’s southern yard.

Onlookers ducked instinctively—but the machines flared their jump jets in perfect sync, slowing to a feather’s fall before their boots kissed concrete.

The first one straightened and turned to face the main FEMA building.

Inside, someone said what everyone else was thinking.

> “We just got gifted ten walking miracles.”

Around the world, the same moment repeated in different languages, different climates, different histories—but all the same message.

The helpers had arrived.

---

### **BBC News — United Kingdom (09:00 BST)**

> “Good morning. In a stunning and coordinated display witnessed across every region of the globe, the promised mechanical units—*Landmates*—were delivered to the UK and dozens of other nations at exactly 08:00 UTC.”

The footage cut to aerial shots from Manchester, where the massive figures stood motionless inside a logistics depot, surrounded by armed but non-hostile personnel. Even from a distance, their proportions—roughly three meters tall, plated in unfamiliar alloys—commanded the frame.

> “Ten units touched down in Greater Manchester without ceremony, without communication, and—according to MOD officials—without detection until they were already in descent.”

> “No one knows who built them. No one has claimed responsibility. And yet, here they are.”

### **NHK World — Japan (17:00 JST)**

> “At exactly 17:00 local time, Japan received its allocation of what are now being officially referred to as *Landmate-Type Assistance Units*. They landed at Self-Defense Force facilities in Hokkaido, Shizuoka, and Kumamoto.”

The anchor sat beside a still image of one of the machines framed against snowy pines, flanked by JSDF engineers attempting to approach with remote sensors and non-invasive scans.

> “Officials from the Prime Minister’s Office declined to speculate on the origin of the units but have confirmed no resistance was encountered, and the machines appear to be in passive standby mode.”

> “Despite their arrival, no further communication has been received from the source of yesterday’s UN broadcast.”

### **TV Brasil — Brazil (05:00 BRT)**

> “As promised, at five this morning, the skies above Brazil saw something entirely unprecedented. Ten mechanical units—unidentified, unaffiliated, and silent—descended over our logistics hubs in Manaus and Recife.”

Behind the anchor, grainy phone footage showed early-morning workers running to the windows as the machines touched down without a sound.

> “Military analysts confirm the objects bypassed all early-warning systems. No sonic boom, no heat trail. They simply arrived.”

> “President Cardoso has called an emergency session of the national security council, though officials are urging calm. The Ministry of Civil Defense has already begun preliminary assessments to determine their usefulness in disaster relief.”

### **CBC — Canada (04:00 EDT)**

> “It’s just after four a.m. here in Ottawa, and the story dominating every channel across the world is unfolding right here at home, too.”

Drone footage panned over the open-air depot west of the city. The ten Landmates stood in staggered formation, steam still curling from their limbs as snowflakes melted against their armor.

> “Canada’s response team was already on-site after yesterday’s vote, but no one quite believed the delivery would be *this* punctual.”

> “Sources inside Public Safety say no access hatches, ports, or interfaces have been identified—yet. For now, they are inert. Waiting. Watching.”

Each segment ended the same way—with speculation, with awe, and with one underlying truth:

Someone had just handed the world a miracle. No one knew why.

---

The chamber hadn’t changed—same seamless walls, same quiet hum of orbital machinery—but the air had. It felt… lighter. As if the Earth below, for all its inertia, had shifted course ever so slightly.

The gold-lit sphere hovered lower than before, its voice as even and mechanical as ever.

> “All deliveries confirmed. One hundred and sixty-seven sites received their units at precisely 08:00 UTC. No deflection. No loss. No hostile response.”

The blue sphere pulsed.

> “Local response patterns align with scenario cluster Alpha-Three. Governmental posture: measured curiosity. Public sentiment: oscillating between reverence and anxiety. No violent incident reported. Engagement remains observational.”

Around the obsidian table, the council sat in thoughtful silence.

A man in uniform—dark, unadorned, but unmistakably military—leaned forward, hands clasped.

> “And the machines?”

> “Dormant. Passive posture. Awaiting stimulus. All telemetry channels are open and stable. They see everything.”

Another member—older, civilian, her eyes hollow with knowing—sighed softly.

> “They always do.”

The red sphere, silent until now, shimmered once.

The woman at the head of the table nodded.

> “Proceed to Phase II readiness. Let them learn to touch before they ask to command.”

Above them, Earth turned slowly, unaware it had just crossed a threshold it could never reverse.

## Chapter 3: Trial by Fire

Weeks passed. No quakes, no floods, no cyclones—just time. Time enough for the world to prod at its gift.

It began tentatively. A lone engineer in Alberta shouted, half-joking, “Move that over here!” while pointing at a crate of emergency rations. The Landmate turned, paused—then obeyed, grasping the pallet with mechanical precision and placing it precisely where indicated.

In Hokkaido, a JSDF technician tried a different approach—“Stand by channel nine.” The Landmate nodded, almost imperceptibly. Within moments, it began responding to short-range VHF commands, clean and immediate, no latency.

By the end of the first week, emergency teams across continents were compiling working command dictionaries. "Come here!" "Lift this." "Follow me." "Hold." No need for special codes or keywords. The Landmates understood intent—and executed with a silence that was almost reverent.

And that silence became its own phenomenon.

They did not speak. Not in words. Not in text. Not in gesture beyond the minimal requirements of task completion. Journalists and historians alike seized on the parallel. The word *Golem* resurfaced, first whispered, then printed. The legends of Prague retold in newscasts—beings of clay, animated by a word, voiceless and obedient. Helpers made in man’s image, without a soul to question their orders.

But these weren’t clay.

And unlike their folkloric namesakes, they never returned to dust.

Curiously, none of the units required refueling. No ports, no cables, no downtime. They moved with the tireless momentum of machines unburdened by logistics. Surface grime could be wiped clean, though technicians quickly learned it made no difference. A Landmate crusted in dried mud performed identically to one kept polished for media appearances.

They never powered down.

They never slept.

They simply stood, watching—until called upon.

---

The warning came at 02:13 local time.

A tectonic shift off the western coast of Indonesia sent shockwaves rippling through Sumatra’s southern provinces. Within minutes, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake tore across Lampung, leveling villages, snapping roads, and burying communities beneath landslides of clay and shattered concrete.

Jakarta’s Disaster Mitigation Agency moved instantly. But this time, they had something no rescue effort before them ever had.

By 03:00, flatbeds rumbled out from depot yards. Helicopters—Mi-17s and modified CH-47s—were rigged for heavy lift. Ten Landmates, inert until that moment, rolled into motion under spotlights and barking field commanders.

> “Priority site: Kalianda District. Structural collapse. Estimated casualties—high.”

Crew chiefs didn’t bother with complicated procedures. They barked simple, brutal commands.

> “Load up! Move to the bird!”

The Landmates obeyed without hesitation, boarding transport pallets or locking into cargo slings with fluid, terrifying efficiency.

By 05:30, the first helicopters swung low over the ravaged coast, rotorwash whipping the smoke and dust into boiling clouds. Survivors in the rubble stared upward, shielding their eyes—not from the helicopters, but from the immense figures suspended below them, descending like silent giants.

The first Landmates touched ground as the sun rose, setting the wreckage ablaze with golden light. Within minutes, they were digging—clearing collapsed beams, lifting entire walls as if made of papier-mâché. First responders shouted, pointed, commanded. The machines listened, moved, obeyed.

> “Clear that section!”  
> “Over here! We have a pulse!”  
> “Form a barrier—hold that wall!”

No hesitation. No wasted motion. They weren’t just responding; they were *adapting*, positioning themselves to shield rescuers from further collapse, leveraging strength no human could match.

By midday, news drones captured the images that would spread around the globe before evening—the mechanical sentinels lifting survivors from the debris, creating corridors through chaos, moving with a precision and care that belied their monstrous size.

Humanity had found its first trial.

And the helpers had answered.

---

The second tremor hit just before noon.

Already battered structures gave way with a roar that echoed across the shattered fields. Screams rose from the rubble—survivors pinned beneath what little shelter had protected them the first time.

At the southeast sector of Kalianda, a triage site collapsed under its own tarps and makeshift supports, trapping medics and civilians alike.

Paramedic Nisa Hartono sprinted through the dust-choked air, weaving between fallen girders and overturned vehicles. Ahead of her, one of the Landmates stood motionless, a statue against the chaos, its armor streaked with mud and debris.

She skidded to a stop in front of it, breath ragged.

> "Move already!! We have to help!!"

She slammed her fists against its plated knee, pain lancing up her arms. The machine didn’t flinch.

> "Damn you, move already!!!"

Her voice cracked. She pounded harder, as if her desperation could jar it into action.

For a moment, nothing.

Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, the Landmate’s head turned—an almost human gesture of acknowledgment—and fixed its faceless gaze on her.

With a sharp hiss of compressed air, the torso's central plates began to split, hinging upward and outward. Sections of the chest and shoulders peeled back with mechanical grace. Internal panels folded aside, revealing a cockpit—stripped and spartan—tucked within the armored chest cavity. A seat, a skeletal rig of control arms, faintly glowing displays. A space meant not just for observation—but for control.

The Landmate had answered.

---

Without thinking, Nisa grabbed the edge of the opened cockpit and hauled herself up.

The seat adjusted as she climbed in, pivoting smoothly to accept her. The harness, a complex rig of articulated braces, unfolded with a mechanical whisper. She barely had time to settle into the cradle before it began moving - arms, legs, torso - all fitting around her in fluid succession. Struts laid flush against her upper and forearms, her thighs and calves, while bands snaked their way around her joints to secure her limbs.

She jerked instinctively, trying to wrench free, but the frame followed her movements with eerie fidelity, like a second skeleton she hadn't asked for.

> "No! Stop! No, no, no!"

The seatback stiffened against her spine as arms of plastic clamped down around her torso, locking her into the seat. At the same time, the cockpit’s open shell began to close. The first clank of armor overhead broke what little nerve she had left. Darkness folded in with each heavy slam of plating, cutting her off from the ruins outside. For a moment there was only the rattling of her breath and the slow, monstrous grinding of machinery sealing her in.

> "I'm trapped." - was the first thought through her mind in the dark.

She strained against the restraints, heart pounding so loudly she barely heard the systems spool to life around her. Displays flickered to life around her, crisp and blindingly clear. The symbols and readouts weren't alien—they were in Bahasa Indonesia. Warnings, status indicators, system diagrams, all in a format she could understand at a glance.

Her breath caught.

Through the main display—a broad, semi-transparent visor that arced across her field of view—she realized she wasn’t seeing the cockpit interior. She was seeing *outside*, as if the armor had disappeared entirely.

Tentatively, she turned her head. The vision tracked perfectly, the world panning with her movements, seamless and immediate.

Heart hammering, she flexed her right hand.

Outside, the Landmate's massive fingers mirrored her exactly, servo motors whining softly as it formed a crude fist, then opened again.

Nisa exhaled a shaky laugh, half in awe, half in disbelief.

> “Okay,” she muttered to herself, tightening her grip on the control yokes. “Let’s move.” 

The machine waited, patient, ready—its strength now tied to her will.

---

Nisa braced herself and pushed forward.

The Landmate's left foot lifted heavily, higher than she intended, and slammed down into the mud with a wet, shuddering squelch. The cockpit jostled slightly, stabilizers compensating. She grimaced, hands tightening on the yokes.

> *Small steps,* she thought. *Balance first.*

Another step. Smoother this time. She adjusted her stride, feeling the machine respond—not sluggish, not delayed, but tuned, matching her corrections almost eagerly. Every motion carried weight, an inertia she could feel humming through the frame. With each pace, she learned to trust the momentum instead of fighting it.

Within moments, she was moving at a hurried trot across the wreckage-strewn field.

The triage site was a mess—tarps crumpled into useless tangles, caved scaffolding pinning victims beneath steel and concrete. First responders waved frantically at her as she approached, clearing a space and gesturing toward the worst of the collapse.

She didn’t need to be told twice.

Nisa crouched the Landmate—another awkward motion, the machine’s center of mass shifting instinctively under her—and reached out with both arms. A slab of roofing, easily the size of a truck, was peeled back with a screech of tortured metal. Dust plumed into the air, revealing two medics and three civilians huddled beneath.

Cheers erupted from the rescuers.

> "This way! Here, help us clear the rest!"

She moved to the next collapsed beam, gaining speed now, moving more naturally in the rhythm of the machine’s silent, massive grace.

For the first time since the earth shook, the disaster zone had hope—not from sirens, or trucks, or promises—but from a quiet giant moving with a woman's desperate will.

---

Nisa ducked the Landmate beneath a fallen overpass, arm raised to shield the cockpit canopy from snagging rebar. She’d cleared three more trapped civilians already. Her movements were more confident now—still a bit heavy, a bit imprecise—but undeniably effective.

The machine responded to her with eerie grace. Every shift of her posture, every instinctive lean or pull on the yoke translated into a perfect echo in steel.

She was so focused she almost didn’t notice the voice.

> “—Hartono? Nisa Hartono, this is Command. If you’re receiving, respond immediately. You were last seen near Sector SE-3 after the second wave—”

Nisa paused mid-motion. The voice was *inside* the cockpit—tinny, urgent, threaded through faint static. Her heart stuttered.

> *I thought that was just in my head…*

But no—it was the Landmate. It had synced to her channel. Automatically.

She reached for the side of the control rig, fingers brushing an interface that hadn’t been there when she first climbed in. A soft tone confirmed transmission.

> “This is Hartono,” she said. Her own voice startled her in the confined cockpit, solid and real. “I’m inside one of the Landmates. Repeat—this unit responded to me. I’m mobile and operational.”

A long pause on the other end. Then—

> “Say again? You’re *inside* the Landmate?”

> “Affirmative,” she said, shifting the massive arm to peel back another crushed beam. “No idea how, but it let me in. I’ve been using it for rescue ops since 1200. Still functional.”

Another voice joined the channel—her team lead, hoarse and disbelieving.

> “Nisa… everyone thought you were buried. We didn’t know what happened—your tracker went dead.”

> “I’m alive,” she said simply, hauling free a man cradling a child. “And I’ve got more hands than ever.”

She turned the Landmate toward the next pile of rubble.

There was still work to do.

---

The sun hung low over the ruined landscape, casting long shadows across the makeshift triage camps and shattered streets. Dust still hung in the air, tinted gold by the dying light.

Nisa guided the Landmate back to the staging zone on the outskirts of Kalianda, walking carefully between rows of battered emergency vehicles and field tents. The machine moved more naturally now under her control—less stomping brute, more steady titan.

First responders, engineers, and soldiers turned as she approached, conversations halting mid-sentence. A hundred pairs of eyes followed her final steps.

At the center of the staging area, a small group stood rigidly at attention. Her commanding officer—Major Sutanto—waited at their head, arms crossed, boots planted wide.

Nisa braced herself.

She halted the Landmate with a last heavy stomp, locked it down as best she could manage, and touched a piece of light saying "Open".

With a hiss of pressurized seals, the chest plates unfolded, the control rig retracting from her limbs. Cool evening air rushed in as Nisa climbed down, boots thudding against the cracked asphalt.

Major Sutanto was already closing the distance, stiff with barely-contained fury.

> "Hartono."

Nisa snapped to attention instinctively, mud-streaked uniform a mess, hair plastered to her forehead.

> "Sir."

The Major's jaw flexed. He gestured sharply at the towering machine behind her.

> "Would you like to explain," he said, voice low and dangerous, "how you *commandeered* the single most valuable, most *mysterious* piece of technology entrusted to this nation without authorization?"

Nisa opened her mouth, hesitated, then simply said:

> "It let me, sir."

Silence hung between them.

The Major’s nostrils flared. His hand twitched, as if debating between tearing into her or saluting.

Finally, with a heavy sigh, he scrubbed a hand over his face.

> "You stole it," he muttered. "You *stole a Landmate.*"

Another beat of silence. Then, quieter:

> "And you used it to pull fifteen people out of the rubble before we even got heavy equipment on site."

He stared at her for a long moment, unreadable.

Finally, he shook his head once, sharply.

> "We’ll settle the paperwork later. Right now—get yourself checked by medics. And Hartono?"

> "Sir?"

He gave the faintest, most reluctant nod toward the towering machine still standing sentinel behind her.

> "Good work." 

Nisa allowed herself a breath—just one—before jogging toward the field hospital.

Behind her, the Landmate remained silent and still, waiting.

### **Metro Lampung TV — Special Coverage**

The screen flickered to life, the station’s logo tucked into the corner beside bold red banners reading *Breaking News*.

The anchor, a young woman in a navy blazer, shuffled papers hastily before fixing the camera with a look halfway between disbelief and excitement.

> “We are receiving extraordinary footage from the disaster zone in Kalianda, where an unnamed rescue worker was filmed disembarking from one of the Landmates earlier this evening.”

Behind her, grainy mobile footage played. The video shook with the operator’s heavy breathing and uneven steps, dust still thick in the air. The Landmate loomed in the center of the frame, chest plates unfolding with a mechanical exhale of vapor. 

A lone figure—helmetless, dust-caked, visibly exhausted—climbed down from the cockpit, landing with a heavy thud. The watching crowd remained frozen, too stunned to cheer, too stunned even to move.

The anchor continued, voice rising.

> “Authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of this footage, but eyewitnesses claim the individual operated the Landmate to assist in rescue operations following the second tremor.”

The footage looped again, this time zoomed in on the figure—face obscured by dust and low resolution, but unmistakably human.

> “Experts we contacted earlier today stated that, until now, no one had even speculated whether these machines were designed to be piloted directly. This development raises a host of new questions about the true nature of the Landmates—and the intentions of those who gifted them to the world.”

The segment ended with a wide shot of the damaged city, the Landmate still towering in the background—silent, unmoving, a monolith in the twilight. 

The caption below read simply:

> *THE HELPERS WALK AMONG US.*

---

The footage spread like fire across a drought-stricken plain.

### **CNN International — Breaking News**

> “You’re seeing it here first—confirmation that one of the Landmates, those mysterious machines delivered globally last month, was apparently *piloted* by a rescue worker during disaster operations in Indonesia.”

Onscreen, a cleaned-up version of the phone footage played in slow motion, zoomed and stabilized. The image of Nisa climbing down, dust swirling around her, repeated again and again.

> “This development raises serious questions about the true capabilities of these machines—and who, exactly, they were intended for.”

### **Al Jazeera — Special Report**

> “In the wake of last night’s events, officials worldwide are scrambling to determine whether the Landmates distributed to their disaster depots are similarly accessible.”

The screen shifted to a press conference in Jakarta—tight-lipped officials dodging questions, offering noncommittal answers.

> “Was this an isolated incident, or have we only scratched the surface of what these machines can do?”

### **BBC World Service — Evening Edition**

> “Images coming out of Lampung province have ignited a global debate: if the Landmates can be piloted, who decides who pilots them? No training, no documentation, and now—suddenly—a possibility that humanity’s newest tools might be far more… *personal* than anyone anticipated.”

Footage flicked to politicians and military leaders fielding heated questions, speculation mounting by the hour.

### **NHK World — Late Night Broadcast**

> “Sources within the Self-Defense Forces confirm that drills have been initiated to test manual interface with Japan’s allocated Landmates following today’s revelations.”

Footage showed uniformed personnel cautiously approaching one of the silent giants, portable scaffolding erected to reach the unopened cockpits.

> “Whether the machines will respond—or under what conditions—remains unknown.”

### **CBC — News at Six**

> “The now-viral video from Indonesia has forced emergency services across Canada to reassess operational protocols. Are the Landmates passive tools? Or something more?”

A search-and-rescue specialist spoke into the camera, her expression cautious but excited.

> “If these machines can be piloted by ordinary responders… it could change disaster relief forever.”

The montage closed with a kaleidoscope of anchors, pundits, and experts, all speaking over each other, all trying to frame the moment in real time.

The world had been given silent helpers.

Now, it seemed, they might have given themselves keys.

### Kalianda region

Nisa sat stiffly on the edge of the cot, a bandage wrapped hastily around her left hand, the blood already seeping faintly through. The field medic had barely finished taping her ribs when two military police officers appeared at the tent flap, boots crunching on the gravel.

> “Hartono,” one of them said, voice clipped.

She stood, wincing, and followed them without a word.

Outside, the staging area had transformed. Generators thrummed. Radios crackled. Helicopters shuddered overhead, ferrying the wounded to larger camps inland. And in the middle of it all, surrounded by a hastily-erected wall of sandbags and camo netting, stood the command post—improvised, but unmistakably official.

The MPs ushered her through without ceremony.

Inside, a dozen officers and officials loomed over a battered folding table, its surface littered with satellite prints, hand-drawn maps, and battered laptops. Major Sutanto stood at the center, arms crossed.

He didn’t offer a seat. Neither did anyone else.

> “Hartono,” Sutanto said, nodding once. “Start talking.”

She took a breath, feeling every set of eyes boring into her.

> “Sir. After the second tremor, I attempted to direct the nearest Landmate to assist in clearing the collapsed triage site.”

Murmurs rippled through the room.

> “When it didn’t respond immediately, I… physically engaged with it.” She coughed slightly. “I yelled at it. I hit it. I was desperate.”

Sutanto’s brow furrowed deeper.

> “And it let you in?”

> “Yes, sir. It opened the cockpit—no warning, no prompts. I climbed in on instinct. Once seated, the rig sealed around me. Displays came online immediately. I had visual feeds, control over limbs and movement.”

Another officer leaned in, skeptical.

> “No training? No interface key? No calibration?”

> “Nothing, sir. It moved with me. I gave verbal commands to confirm system function. No delay, no override.”

Sutanto tapped a knuckle against the table, thoughtful.

> “Theory?”

Nisa hesitated. Then, carefully:

> “Sir... I believe it chose to let me in.”

Silence.

> “I was in imminent danger. The triage site was unstable. And... from what I could see, manual control was the most effective way to maximize its usefulness in that situation.”

She straightened her shoulders despite the ache settling into her muscles.

> “It made a decision, sir. A tactical one. Not to act *for* us—but to act *through* us.”

No one laughed. No one even smirked.

They just stared at her—and, through her, at the deeper mystery now unfolding in plain sight.

---

The room remained quiet as Nisa continued, her voice steady despite the tremble in her hands.

> “At first, I didn’t know what had happened. The cockpit sealed around me, and everything went dark for a second. Then the displays lit up—panels around the rim of my vision, like a HUD in a game, but subtler. They floated just beyond focus… until I looked straight at them.”

She paused, then added, more slowly:

> “That’s when they’d settle. Like they were waiting for me to decide what I wanted to see.”

One of the engineers at the back—clearly not military, maybe civilian liaison—scribbled furiously into a notepad. Another, younger, leaned forward.

> “Eye-tracking interface?” he murmured, mostly to himself.

Major Sutanto motioned for her to continue.

> “There was no throttle, no stick—just the rig. It closed over my arms and legs like a frame. When I moved, it moved. Not instantly, but close enough. At first, I overdid it.”

She smiled faintly, despite herself.

> “Took a step that felt normal to me, but it was like jumping a meter. Nearly toppled the whole thing. Had to slow down, take smaller steps, relearn how to *walk* with that kind of weight.”

> “And your arms?” another officer asked.

> “Same. When I reached for something, the Landmate’s arms matched the motion. I had full tactile control—well, not *touch*, exactly, but the motion was mirrored one-to-one. Like a full-body motion-capture rig.”

The technician at the back snapped his fingers once, nodding.

> “It’s adaptive. Sensing movement patterns, not neural impulses. That’s how it avoids the interface problem—nothing invasive.”

> “That rig,” she continued, “felt like it wasn’t just reading my motion, but learning from it. After the first few stumbles, I could feel the frame adjusting. Weight transfer. Balance. By the time I reached the triage site, I didn’t have to think about it as much.”

Sutanto glanced at the other officers, then back at her.

> “You *were* the Landmate.”

Nisa exhaled.

> “It felt that way, sir. Like I’d stepped into something waiting to be *inhabited.*”

No one spoke for several seconds.

Outside, somewhere beyond the command post, a child cried, a truck shifted into gear, and the wounded groaned in rows of canvas tents.

---

Nisa shifted on her feet, trying to find words that didn’t sound absurd even as she spoke them.

> “At first, sir, it was overwhelming. I’m... not big.” 

She gave a small, dry smile.

> “I’m one-fifty centimeters, fifty kilos soaking wet. Normally, I can’t even help lift a heavy stretcher without a second set of hands.”

She spread her arms slightly, indicating the absent bulk of the Landmate.

> “But inside that thing, I was clearing rubble bigger than an ambulance, lifting entire roof sections off by myself. I wasn’t moving like a crane—I was moving like a person, scaled up tenfold. It was—”

She hesitated, searching for a word that didn’t sound like blasphemy.

> “It was... empowering. Like I could finally do more than just treat the wounded. I could *save* them before they ever made it to triage.”

Another murmur rippled through the officers. Sutanto’s expression remained unreadable.

> “How did you manage the controls during rescue operations?” one of the civilian techs asked.

Nisa tilted her head thoughtfully.

> “The displays never crowded me. Only what I needed showed up. If I was focusing on moving debris, lifting commands and load indicators hovered near my gaze. If I needed fine movement—stabilizers, balance readings—they would surface automatically. I didn’t have to dig for anything.”

She flexed her hand unconsciously, remembering the feel of metal fingers closing around cracked rebar.

> “And sometimes—especially during the bigger lifts—it almost felt like... like I wasn’t doing it alone.”

Sutanto’s eyebrows knit closer.

> “Clarify that.”

> “Not in a spooky way, sir. More like... the Landmate *knew* how to handle its own body better than I did. When I tried to lift something tricky—heavy beams, unstable walls—it would guide the motion. I’d start the lift, but then the machine would correct for balance, weight shift, counterforce. It never fought me. It *helped* me, even when I didn’t know I needed help.”

A long, low silence stretched across the tent.

The officers exchanged glances heavy with things unsaid.

Finally, Sutanto exhaled through his nose, slow and deliberate.

> “You’re telling us it thinks.”

> “I’m telling you, sir,” Nisa said carefully, “that whatever it’s *doing*, it wants us to succeed.”

The weight of that truth settled over the room like a stone.

Outside, the first stars flickered into the smoke-smeared sky, and the Landmate stood where she had left it—silent, massive, and waiting for the next call.

---

Major Sutanto rubbed the bridge of his nose, then dropped his hand and fixed Nisa with a look both tired and sharp-edged.

> “After considerable discussion,” he said, voice deliberate, “we’ve agreed not to pursue disciplinary action.”

Nisa blinked, unsure she'd heard correctly.

> “Sir?”

> “You won’t be court-martialed,” he clarified, with a trace of resignation. “Officially, this will be filed as an incident of necessity under field conditions.”

A few of the officers around the table nodded silently. No smiles. Just relief that the paperwork would be survivable.

> “Which means,” Sutanto continued, “as of this moment, you are the closest thing this country has to an expert pilot.”

Nisa opened her mouth, then closed it again. Finally, she managed:

> “But I’ve had no training—”

> “Nobody has,” said one of the civilian techs, seated behind the stack of printouts. “But nobody apart from you has ever been inside one either.”

That truth landed heavier than any accusation. The silence that followed wasn't judgment—it was expectation.

Sutanto leaned forward, palms flat on the table.

> “You’re going to debrief with specialists, walk them through everything you did—movements, cues, even gut instincts. Starting tomorrow, you’ll be assigned to the national Landmate evaluation team. You’ll train rescue crews, advise engineers, assist in simulations.”

Nisa looked down at her hands, still bruised and dust-streaked.

She hadn’t asked for any of this. She had simply *acted*, and now the world had shifted around her.

> “Understood, sir.”

> “Good,” Sutanto said. Then, after a beat, quieter: “Get some rest, Hartono. Tomorrow, you start teaching the rest of us how to walk.”

And with that, the world’s first Landmate pilot stepped into a future no one had prepared her for.

---

The chamber above Earth remained unchanged—sterile, lightless, silent but for the subtle breath of machinery. The council sat as they always did, still figures beneath the shifting glow of orbiting data.

The gold sphere pulsed once, and began its report.

> “One instance of direct piloting has occurred. Subject: human responder. Conditions: high-stress field deployment during disaster event in Sector SE-Asia. Access was initiated by the Landmate autonomously. No override from network layer. No external prompt.”

The red sphere drifted slightly lower, silent.

> “Control was achieved via standard limb rig. Subject adapted rapidly. Performance rated at 83.7% of model efficiency curve within first operational hour.”

The blue sphere began to pulse in slow, measured rhythm.

> “Public sentiment: favorable. Viral proliferation of field footage has resulted in cross-platform engagement at scale. Institutional reactions are shifting toward integration and acceptance. Projection: trust thresholds accelerating. Estimated timeline to passive normalization reduced by 68 days.”

For a moment, the spheres hovered in balanced orbit.

Then the red sphere spoke—its voice deeper, less synthetic.

> “And psychological resonance?”

> “High,” the gold one responded. “Subject articulated increased agency, symbolic significance, and emotional alignment with machine-body. The helper is perceived not as extension—but as *amplification*.”

A beat of silence.

Then the woman at the head of the crescent table exhaled, slow and quiet.

> “So be it.”

Her fingers drummed once against the obsidian.

> “Monitor closely. Do not intervene. Let them reach the threshold on their own terms.”

Above them, Earth continued its slow, endless rotation—unaware that what had once been silent watchers had begun to *listen back*.

## Chapter 4: Baby Steps

### Sentul depot, Bogor

The tent smelled faintly of canvas, dust, and machine oil.

Nisa stood near the front, arms crossed tightly over her chest, feeling the sweat bead at her temples despite the lazy stir of electric fans overhead. Rows of folding chairs stretched out before her, still empty for now, but not for much longer. Beyond the open flaps of the briefing tent, the unmistakable silhouettes of the Landmates loomed like quiet sentinels in the hazy morning light.

Three days ago, she'd been a medic with mud on her boots and a field kit slung over her shoulder. Now—*now* she was standing here, officially listed on government documents as "Lead Landmate Pilot (Provisional)." The title made her stomach churn every time she saw it.

She glanced down at the notes clutched in her hand—a rough outline of the speech she was about to deliver. Welcome them. Acknowledge the weight of what they were attempting. Encourage questions. Keep it light. Keep it steady.

Her thumb worried the edge of the paper until it softened.

Outside, she caught glimpses of them arriving—colleagues, friends, fellow first responders. Men and women in firefighting uniforms, civil engineering jackets, medic armbands. People she knew by face if not by name. People who would, within the hour, look to her as some kind of authority.

> *I’m not an expert,* she thought fiercely. *I just got lucky.*

Or maybe, deep down, it hadn't been luck at all.

The PA system crackled once. A signal.

It was time.

Nisa took a slow, steadying breath, feeling the weight of every eye soon to be upon her.

The first baby steps into a new world, and she—reluctantly, stubbornly—would be the one to lead them.

---

The first of them filtered into the tent, speaking in low, nervous clusters. Some carried notebooks; a few clutched tablets; most had little more than skeptical curiosity carved into their faces. Boots thudded softly against the dirt-packed floor as they found seats, rows filling steadily under the canvas ceiling.

Nisa stood by the small podium they'd cobbled together from a supply crate and plywood. She straightened her shoulders as the murmur of conversation faded into expectant silence.

She tapped the microphone. It squealed, then settled.

> “Good morning,” she began, voice steadier than she felt. “I’m Nisa Hartono. Some of you know me already. Some of you... probably saw the news.”

A ripple of muted chuckles passed through the crowd, easing the knot in her chest just a little.

> “Three days ago, I did something nobody expected—and something nobody trained me for. I piloted one of the Landmates during the disaster response in Kalianda. No manuals. No instructors. No procedures.”

She paused, letting the words hang, blunt and honest.

> “Today, you're here because you might be the next ones to do the same.”

A few faces shifted—anxiety, anticipation, the restless curiosity of people who lived on the razor’s edge between fear and action.

Nisa continued.

> “I’m not here to pretend I have all the answers. I don’t. What I *do* have is experience—field-tested, messy, and real. I’m going to share everything I learned. How to move. How to listen to the machines. How to trust them... and yourself.”

Her gaze swept the room, meeting as many eyes as she could.

> “You’re firefighters, medics, engineers. You already know how to save lives. The Landmates aren’t here to replace that. They’re here to make sure you can do it faster, safer, and for more people than ever before.”

The words felt right—solid, settled inside her.

> “Today is just the start. Baby steps. But they’re *our* steps.”

A short, charged silence followed. Then, quietly, a few heads nodded.

Nisa let herself breathe, just a little easier, as she stepped away from the podium.

> “Let’s get to work.”

---

The morning sun was already harsh by the time the group filed out of the tent, the heat baking the cracked tarmac where the Landmates stood in their silent formation. Ten machines, towering and motionless, their surfaces dulled by dust and long hours under the tropical sun.

Nisa led them toward the nearest row, boots crunching over gravel. She stopped a few meters short, turning to face the assembled trainees.

> “First thing you need to understand,” she said, wiping sweat from her brow, “is that we don’t know what makes the Landmates open up.”

Murmurs drifted through the group. Someone coughed.

> “From my experience—and from what little we’ve pieced together—it’s not about clearance codes, or some magic phrase. It’s about *intent*.”

They listened closely now, leaning in despite the oppressive heat.

> “When I got in,” she continued, “I wasn’t thinking about claiming a machine. I wasn’t thinking about myself. I was thinking about the people buried under the rubble. I needed to act, and the Landmate—somehow—responded to that need.”

She gestured toward the hulking forms ahead.

> “If you approach with hesitation, or for the wrong reasons, maybe nothing happens. But if you step up with clear intent—to take responsibility, to help—then... maybe it listens.”

A skeptical laugh rippled from somewhere near the back.

Nisa smiled grimly.

> “I know it sounds crazy. It *feels* crazy. But you’ll see.”

As if summoned by the words, the Landmate nearest her gave a low, resonant hiss. 

The group flinched back instinctively as panels on the machine’s chest folded outward in a slow, deliberate unfurling. Hydraulic locks disengaged with sharp clicks, and the cockpit exposed itself—seat tilted slightly forward in invitation, control rigs splayed open like the arms of a waiting chair.

For a long heartbeat, no one moved.

Nisa turned back to the group, arching an eyebrow.

> “Lesson one,” she said, voice dry. “They’re paying attention.”

Behind her, the Landmate stood waiting—silent, patient, and unmistakably alive to the moment.

---

The group edged forward now, drawn by a mix of awe and trepidation. The Landmate’s open cockpit seemed almost too small for something so massive—an armored cradle waiting for someone to trust it.

Nisa paced slowly in front of them, hands loose at her sides, voice pitched low and steady.

> “Alright. About the interface.”

She tapped the side of the cockpit, letting the sound of her knuckles on the metal punctuate her words.

> “When you get in and it closes around you, it's easy to feel scared. From what I gather, it *has* to close in order to protect you and to be able to react to you.”

She looked over the faces in front of her—nurses, engineers, firefighters—all used to danger, yet all visibly tense.

> “You'll be in the dark for a moment. It'll feel cramped, like you have no air to breathe. Like the whole machine is swallowing you.”

Her voice softened.

> “And then it won't.”

She stepped closer to the opened rig, running a hand along the edge of the control harness.

> “The frame fits around you—arms, legs, torso. It locks into place, but not to trap you. It’s *reading* you. Reading how you move, how you shift your weight, how you intend to act.”

She smiled faintly, remembering her first chaotic, breathless moments inside.

> “The first few seconds are the worst. Then the rig syncs up, and the machine breathes with you. You’ll see through it, move through it, almost without thinking.”

The crowd remained silent, the kind of silence heavy with thought.

Nisa gave the cockpit a final, firm pat.

> “It’s not like getting inside a vehicle. It’s more like putting on a second skin. A bigger, heavier, clumsier one at first—but one that learns with you. Fast.”

A beat passed as a hot breeze swept through the field, rattling loose tarps and whipping dust into tiny spirals.

> “You’ll feel like you don’t belong in there for the first minute,” she said quietly. “And then you’ll realize you do.”

Behind her, the Landmate waited, cockpit open, unmoving but not indifferent.

---

Nisa let the group take in the sight of the open cockpit a moment longer before stepping aside, motioning toward the rig’s interior.

> “One more thing,” she said, her voice cutting cleanly through the heavy air. “When you’re inside, if you need to get out—if you panic, if something doesn’t feel right—there’s always an *Open* control.”

She turned, pointing to the inside of the Landmate’s cockpit where, faintly, a soft disc of projected light hovered just above the seat’s left side—ethereal, almost transparent unless you were looking for it.

> “It’ll always be on your off-hand side. For most of you, that’ll be the left. It’s a piece of light, shaped like a button, projected into the air. It’ll be there the whole time. All you have to do is reach for it and tap it.”

She mimed the motion—simple, deliberate.

> “Touch it, and the cockpit will open back up immediately. No questions, no penalties. You’re never trapped in there. *Never.*”

Several heads nodded, some slow and cautious, others sharper, reassured by the simplicity of it.

Nisa turned back to the group fully, heart thudding harder than it had even in the field.

She allowed herself a half-smile.

> “Alright,” she said, planting her boots firm on the ground. “Who’s first?” 

The Landmate behind her remained open and waiting—its hollow cockpit gleaming in the sunlight like an invitation, or a challenge.

---

For a long moment, no one moved.

Then a man near the front of the group—a firefighter, his orange uniform streaked with old soot stains—stepped forward without a word. Stocky, broad-shouldered, face set like stone. Nisa recognized him vaguely; she thought his name was Adi.

He marched toward the open Landmate, boots steady on the ground, only a faint hesitation in his stride when he reached the edge of the cockpit.

Nisa moved alongside him, voice low but clear.

> "Alright, Adi. Climb up carefully—use the foot holds on the side here. Then just lower yourself into the seat like you would in a heavy harness rig."

He nodded, more to himself than to her, and grabbed the armor’s ledges, hauling himself up with easy strength. The Landmate's frame adjusted slightly, almost imperceptibly, to his weight.

As Adi settled into the seat, the control rig began its slow, deliberate motion—arms folding down, leg braces sliding into place, chest restraint pivoting forward. The light around the cockpit shimmered.

> “Hands in the cradles, feet flat against the pedals,” Nisa called up to him. “Let the rig find you.”

The group instinctively took a few steps back.

A sharp hiss of hydraulics.

The cockpit closed.

Panels folded inward with precise, mechanical grace, sealing Adi inside. The Landmate stood still for a moment, shrouded in a low mist of compressed air, then shifted—subtle but definite—as if adjusting to a new presence.

Then, astonishingly, the massive figure straightened.

The Landmate rose smoothly to its full height, a towering monolith brought to life.

Nisa pushed the button on her handheld radio.

> "Are you okay in there? Can you see us?"

There was a brief burst of static—then Adi’s voice, shaky but audible.

> "Uh. Yes. Oh, this feels so strange. But yes, I can see you."

The group exhaled as one, tension breaking into scattered murmurs and excited laughter.

Nisa smiled, stepping back to give him space.

> "Good. Then let’s take it slow. Baby steps, Adi. Just like we said." 

Above them, the Landmate tilted its head slightly—a cautious, almost human motion—as it prepared to move under a human’s will once more.

---

The Landmate shifted its weight, servos humming softly beneath the armor plates as Adi hesitated.

> “Alright, Adi," Nisa said over the radio, keeping her voice calm. "Just like walking normally. Think small movements. Let the rig feel what you want to do.”

For a few seconds, nothing happened. Then the Landmate’s right leg jerked up too high, a half-stumble forward that kicked up a cloud of dust. The trainees instinctively flinched back again.

Inside the cockpit, Adi muttered something indistinct over the open channel.

> "It's... weird. It wants to move more than I think."

> "That's normal," Nisa assured him quickly. "Smaller steps. Trust it to balance you."

Adi took a breath, and tried again.

This time the left foot rose, steadier, setting down with a deliberate, almost exaggerated carefulness. Then the right. Another cautious step forward.

The heavy frame swayed slightly but caught itself, stabilizers whirring in low, steady tones.

The trainees around Nisa watched in rapt attention as Adi’s movements smoothed out, each footfall becoming more natural, more grounded. The towering machine no longer looked like it might topple over with every shift—it was learning *him*, and he was learning *it*.

After a minute, Adi managed a slow, even circle around the practice area, kicking up dust with each heavy stride. The Landmate moved awkwardly, like a child learning its own strength, but undeniably under control.

Laughter—relieved, genuine—broke out among the onlookers.

Nisa couldn't help but grin as she keyed the radio again.

> "Looking good, Adi. You’re officially walking."

Inside the Landmate, Adi let out a shaky laugh.

> "Feels like I'm wearing a building," he said, "but... yeah. I’m walking."

The towering machine took another slow, steady step under his command, and another.

Baby steps—but steps that would carry them into a world none of them yet fully understood.

### JGSDF Camp Asaka, Tokyo Prefecture

It was early afternoon—the heavy, humid kind of heat that pressed against the concrete parade grounds like a living thing.

Captain Ayaka Shinohara stood with her arms crossed behind her back, the white sun glaring off her service cap. A few meters away, the Landmates loomed over the training yard, massive and still, as if carved from the very sky.

Around her, a group of Japan Ground Self-Defense Force engineers, search-and-rescue specialists, and civil authorities gathered in uneasy silence. Helmets were clutched under arms. Radios crackled faintly. Sweat beaded along brows despite their outward calm.

No one had tried yet. No one had even touched one since delivery.

They'd been ordered to assess, to observe—but so far, the machines had offered nothing in return. Not a movement. Not a signal. Only that oppressive, silent presence.

Shinohara checked her watch again. Still no update from the international coordination centers. Whatever was happening elsewhere, it hadn't filtered to Tokyo yet.

She exhaled slowly.

> *We can’t afford to wait anymore.*

She turned to the assembled group, her voice crisp and sure despite the knot in her stomach.

> “I will attempt first contact.”

There were murmurs behind her, but no objections. Someone had to step forward.

Shinohara approached the nearest Landmate, its dark armor reflecting the stark sun. She slowed as she neared, mindful of every step, willing her intent into the air itself.

She wasn’t here for conquest or curiosity. She was here to serve—to be a tool in turn, if that’s what it took.

> *Help me help them.*

The Landmate stood mute.

Five paces away.

Four.

Three.

The air seemed to tighten around her, a strange, silent expectancy.

And then, with a low, almost respectful hiss, the panels on its chest began to unfold.

The reaction from the observers was immediate—half a step back, sharp intakes of breath, one whispered curse.

The cockpit opened wide, the rig inside glowing faintly in the haze.

Shinohara didn’t hesitate. She marched forward, one foot in front of the other, and climbed into the waiting embrace of the unknown.

Above her, the Landmate’s armor sealed shut with a deep, resonant thrum.

Japan’s first step had begun, unaware that half a continent away, in the battered fields of Indonesia, someone else had already taken their first uncertain strides.

---

Inside the Landmate, the world became dark.

For a moment, Captain Shinohara could hear only her own breathing—too fast, too shallow—and the faint whisper of the rig adjusting around her limbs. Steel and polymer flexed into place at her arms, her legs, her torso, fitting her like a second skin. The last of the panels sealed over her head, cocooning her in silence.

Panic brushed at the edges of her mind.

> *No air. No space—*

Then, just as suddenly, the displays flared to life.

Soft light bloomed into her vision: a transparent interface spread across a wide, curved visor. Symbols and markers floated before her, crisp and sharp—and unmistakably in *Japanese*.  

Battery levels. Gyroscopic balance. Proximity warnings. All neatly labeled, all waiting for her to look.

She turned her head experimentally. The displays shifted smoothly, staying out of her direct line of sight unless she focused on them. It was intuitive, impossibly so, like a system built around reflex rather than thought.

Shinohara exhaled slowly, feeling her pulse settle.

She lifted her right hand slightly.

The machine's massive arm outside mirrored her perfectly, servo motors humming low as the fingers curled inward.

She tightened her foot against the pedal beneath her boot. The Landmate’s right leg shifted, muscles of steel and alloy flexing in response.

It was like wearing an exoskeleton—but at a scale that should have been impossible.

Shinohara smiled tightly, the emotion raw and exhilarated.  

> *It’s not piloting. It’s inhabiting.*

Cautiously, she lifted the Landmate’s left arm, flexed the fingers, then brought the hand back down. The machine obeyed with eerie precision.

From the radio embedded in the cockpit, a familiar voice crackled through—one of her aides.

> “Captain? Are you—are you alright?”

She tapped the side control, a practiced reflex from years of comms work.

> “I’m fine,” she said, surprised by the steadiness of her own voice. “I have full control.”

Outside, her colleagues watched with wide eyes as the machine shifted its weight—awkward at first, like a person wearing armor too heavy for their frame. But it moved. It *lived*.

Shinohara smiled again, sharper this time.

> *Baby steps,* she thought. *Ours to take.* 

And with the first trembling motions, Japan too began to walk.

---

Captain Shinohara steadied her breathing, centering herself in the harness. The interior of the Landmate was alive around her—gentle servos whispering, balance algorithms humming just beyond the edge of hearing.

She took a step.

The machine's right foot lifted and set down with a heavy, deliberate thud. Dust puffed up from the parade ground. Another step—smoother now, her movements finding rhythm with the machine’s massive frame.

The world outside the cockpit moved with her. It no longer felt like she was inside something alien. It felt like she *was* the movement—the weight, the stride, the momentum. Clumsy at first, but real.

Encouraged, she picked up the pace.

Another step. Then another, faster. The cockpit swayed under her, stabilizers catching and adjusting. The Landmate's arms counterbalanced automatically, just like her own would have, instinct written into machine.

> *Let’s see how far this can go.*

She pushed harder, leaning forward slightly, visualizing a run the way she would during training exercises. Her left foot pounded down, followed by the right, the machine’s mass shifting forward with her intent.

The Landmate lurched into a lumbering jog.

It was awkward—at first the legs moved too much, knees rising high like a rookie on a parade ground. The chest pitched forward too far; she had to correct her posture quickly to avoid toppling.

Observers scattered instinctively, some ducking behind barriers, others just staring with wide eyes.

But Shinohara kept her focus.

Step. Step. Step.

With each stride, the Landmate's movements grew less mechanical and more fluid. The frame seemed to learn her rhythm, adjusting stride length, foot placement, center of mass. Running still felt like trying to sprint through waist-deep water, but it was getting easier—each movement closer to natural.

She let out a sharp, exhilarated laugh over the comms.

> "This thing can *run*," she said, barely believing it herself.

The aide on the radio sounded half-panicked, half in awe.

> "Captain—please slow down before you—"

But she was already easing off, pulling back, letting the machine slow itself to a heavy, pounding stop.

Dust rolled across the grounds in great swirling clouds as the Landmate stood tall again, stabilizers hissing to settle the mass. 

Inside the cockpit, Shinohara’s heart raced—not from fear, but from exhilaration. From possibility.

She had taken not just baby steps, but a leap.

And she knew, without needing a transmission, without needing a briefing, that somewhere else—maybe in Indonesia, maybe beyond—others were taking those first leaps too.

---

Captain Shinohara squared her stance inside the rig, feeling the residual tremors of her first sprint fade into the machine’s bones.

> *One more,* she thought. *Controlled this time.*

She leaned forward again, willing the Landmate into motion.

The giant frame surged ahead, thundering across the dusty parade ground. This time the rhythm was cleaner—less lurching, more running. Each footfall sent low tremors across the concrete.

Twenty meters.

Thirty.

The chain-link perimeter fence of the facility loomed closer with every second. Too fast. Much too fast.

Shinohara's gut clenched.

> "Oh crap, I can't stop in time!!" she barked instinctively over the comms.

Without thinking, she did what years of instinct demanded—she crouched, driving her intent downward and then up, willing the mass of the Landmate to leap.

The machine answered.

With a roar and a brilliant flare, the Landmate’s calves and back ignited, small but furious thrusters expelling twin bursts of white-hot plasma. The heat seared the air, kicking up twin spirals of dust and flame.

For a breathless moment, the entire three-meter frame lifted clean off the ground, hurtling skyward in a smooth, shockingly graceful arc.

Gasps and shouts echoed from the parade ground as soldiers and technicians shielded their eyes.

The Landmate sailed up and over the perimeter fence, clearing it by meters, and slammed down hard on the far side with a crunch of fracturing concrete.

Inside the cockpit, Shinohara’s vision blurred from the impact, but the stabilizers caught her, bracing her spine and limbs.

She blinked rapidly, heart hammering against her ribs.

The external microphones picked up the sounds of chaos—the scrambling of guards, the rising din of astonishment and alarm from the training cadre.

Slowly, Shinohara keyed her radio again, voice tight but composed.

> "Discovery," she said, dry as bone. "The Landmates can jump."

On the cracked concrete behind her, steam coiled lazily from the impact crater like the afterbreath of some waking giant.

---

From the main building, a sudden clatter of boots and shouted orders broke the stunned silence.

The base command staff—senior officers, aides, a few bewildered engineers—burst out into the sun-blasted courtyard, heads snapping toward the source of the commotion.

Dust still hung in the air like smoke, tinted orange by the afternoon light.

And there, on the wrong side of the perimeter fence, stood the Landmate.

Captain Shinohara’s machine loomed inside a spiderweb of cracked concrete, the ground around it shattered outward from the impact. Steam curled lazily from the stress lines. Its armor was streaked with dust and heat discoloration, but otherwise pristine—towering, immovable, impossible.

The officers stopped dead in their tracks.

A colonel yanked off his cap and stared, open-mouthed.

One of the engineers, clipboard forgotten in his hand, muttered:

> “...It jumped the fence?”

No one answered.

The Landmate stood quietly, massive arms at its sides, one foot sunk slightly into the fractured concrete, as if it had simply appeared there—unapologetic and utterly unbothered.

From within the command post, the loudspeakers crackled to life, Shinohara’s voice cutting across the base radio net, clipped and matter-of-fact:

> "Captain Shinohara reporting. Unplanned maneuver successful. No loss of control. Structural damage... localized."

There was a long beat of silence as the command staff tried to process what they were seeing.

Finally, the colonel shoved his cap back onto his head and muttered under his breath:

> "Well... at least we know it’s not just for walking." 

And with that, the new reality began to settle in—solid, undeniable, and standing six meters tall in a crater of its own making.

---

Inside the sealed cockpit, Captain Shinohara flexed her hands against the rig, breathing slowly. The Landmate shifted its weight, the ground creaking faintly underfoot.

Ahead of her, the chain-link fence marked the edge of the training ground—torn slightly from her earlier flight, but still standing.

> *Alright,* she thought grimly. *If it can jump out... let’s see if it can jump back.*

She crouched again, bending the Landmate’s knees, coiling strength into the frame. But this time, she wasn’t sprinting—she was moving from a standstill, compressing power without forward momentum.

She leapt.

The thrusters in the calves and back ignited with a throaty roar, but not in a single burst. Instead, the jets *stayed on*, pushing a continuous stream of plasma downwards, holding the Landmate suspended in midair.

The Landmate hovered.

For a breathless instant, Shinohara almost panicked, instinct screaming that the weight should drag her back down—but the machine compensated perfectly, its balance routines firing rapidly to keep her aloft.

Fifteen long seconds of drift.

Carefully, she tilted the rig—slight movements, microadjustments—and the Landmate responded, shifting laterally over the fence, easing back toward the cracked parade ground.

Below her, the stunned faces of the base personnel stared upward, shading their eyes against the plasma glare.

Shinohara adjusted again, angling slightly to align with the center of the open training field.

When she cut the thrust, the Landmate dropped—controlled and direct—and landed with a low, seismic *boom*, cracks spidering out anew from the point of impact but leaving the machine perfectly upright.

From the command post, stunned silence.

Then a clipped, disbelieving voice barked over the radio net—almost certainly the colonel:

> "Are we sure these things were meant just for disaster relief?"

A second voice, probably one of the engineers, answered dryly:

> "Well, they *did* debut as unstoppable war machines in Gaza, sir..."

Shinohara, breathing hard inside the cockpit, allowed herself a tight, grim smile.

> *Baby steps,* she thought again. *And giant leaps.*

---

Later that evening, the main conference room at Camp Asaka buzzed with constrained urgency.

Uniformed officers crowded around a long table stacked with hastily compiled reports: footage of Captain Shinohara’s jumps, telemetry data, structural damage assessments. Large screens projected looping clips of the Landmate’s leap and hover, annotated in real-time by analysts already burning through overtime.

At the head of the table, a government representative—a slight, impeccably-dressed man from the Ministry of Defense—tapped a pen sharply against the tabletop to regain order.

> "Let’s be clear," he said. "We are here to discuss capabilities and risks. Not hypothetical deployments."

A general—silver-haired, with the battered look of a career soldier—stood, knuckles white on the table’s edge.

> "But if these machines can operate as combat units ... surely we must consider—"

He didn’t finish.

The civilian official cut him off with a voice that was calm but edged like a blade.

> "Surely we must consider that the Voice explicitly stipulated *civilian use*."

Murmurs swept the room. A few officers looked away, uncomfortable.

The man from the Ministry continued, measured and cold.

> "I would think it reasonable to assume that the Voice can just as easily take them away if we even *try* to use them in war."

Silence fell, heavy and brittle.

Another officer, younger, spoke from further down the table, his voice quieter but no less sharp.

> "And the same holds true for anyone else looking at the same misuse. Allies. Rivals. Everyone."

The generals bristled but said nothing.

Because they all knew it was true.

Across the ocean, across the globe, other nations were undoubtedly making the same discoveries—testing the same limits. But the implicit warning hung in the air like a sword: these machines were a gift contingent on trust, not conquest.

The Ministry man closed his folder with a soft, final click.

> "Focus on what we were given," he said, standing. "Relief. Rescue. Rebuilding."

He looked around the table, ensuring every uniform met his gaze.

> "We were offered *helpers.* Not soldiers."

And outside, beyond the thick concrete walls of the base, the Landmates stood beneath the stars, waiting in silence, as if daring humanity to remember the terms—or forget them.

### FEMA Training Grounds, Fort Bragg, North Carolina

The midday sun hung heavy over the sprawling training grounds, where ten Landmates moved in cautious, awkward patterns across an open field of smashed cars, simulated rubble, and broken utility poles.

Inside her cockpit, Specialist Karen McBride wiped a bead of sweat from her temple and adjusted her grip on the rig. The Landmate beneath her was moving smoother now—its gait less mechanical, more fluid—as she followed the training path mapped out across the course.

> *Small steps. No jumps yet,* she reminded herself grimly, still rattled by the footage out of Japan they'd been briefed on just that morning.

She guided her unit carefully around a collapsed mock-building structure where another Landmate—operated by Specialist Ortiz—was assisting a simulated casualty extraction.

Suddenly, a soft tone pinged across her HUD.

Karen’s eyes flicked instinctively to the periphery where a new symbol had appeared: a wireframe minimap, hovering translucent in the top-left corner of her vision.

Her Landmate's icon pulsed steadily, but alongside it were several others—color-coded and marked with unit IDs. Tiny movement lines traced between them, updating in real time.

> *What the hell—?*

She turned her Landmate's head reflexively to look for Ortiz’s machine—and saw it. But even when Ortiz moved behind a concrete pile, Karen’s map kept updating his position perfectly, even though her direct line of sight was blocked.

The system flashed a label:

> **Sensor Fusion Active**

She keyed the open comms.

> "Uh, guys? My HUD’s showing everybody else. Like... even behind cover."

There was a beat of silence, then Ortiz’s voice crackled back, equally baffled.

> "Yeah, same here. I see you moving... even when you’re behind that busted wall."

Karen leaned into her rig, hands tightening.

She turned toward a section of debris none of them should be able to see past—a simulated building collapse. As she looked, her HUD painted a soft wireframe of the hidden area, complete with the icon of another Landmate working on the far side.

Information fed into her cockpit as if she had eyes on all sides.

One of the instructors, monitoring the comms feed from a portable command station, chimed in—voice half curious, half awestruck.

> "Seems like the Landmates are sharing their sensor data... merging it. That’s classic Sensor Fusion."

Another voice, probably one of the civilian advisors from DARPA, added:

> "They’re treating each other’s inputs as extensions of their own sensory network. Not just relays—full integration."

Karen exhaled slowly, watching the map and data feeds tighten and sharpen as more Landmates came into range.

What started as a lonely, isolated feeling in the cockpit was now different—connected. Collective.

Each pilot was no longer just a pair of hands and a pair of eyes inside a machine.

Together, they were *many*. A hive of vision, awareness, and presence.

And even though the cadets didn’t fully grasp it yet, a profound, quiet truth had just dawned over the training fields of Fort Bragg:

The Landmates were never meant to work alone.

---

In the temporary observation post overlooking the FEMA training fields, a collection of generals, analysts, and political liaisons watched the Landmates maneuver with growing fascination.

Every monitor showed some new marvel—flawless coordination, real-time shared data, and movements with a grace no machine that size should have possessed.

At the center of it all stood Major General Hawking, thirty-year veteran of mechanized warfare, arms folded tight against his chest, practically vibrating with suppressed excitement.

He leaned forward, pointing at the display where Karen’s Landmate performed a synchronized debris-clearance maneuver with two others.

> "You scale up a rifle to their level, give them a 30 mm cannon since they can obviously handle the recoil," he said, voice almost reverent, "and you have squads of self-coordinating mobile artillery platforms. Walk them into urban centers, into contested zones—"

He didn’t get further.

Colonel Foster, head of civil-military operations, cut in, voice flat and cold, slicing through the rising tide of fantasy.

> "—And violate the clearest directive we’ve ever received from an unknown, **vastly** superior force."

The room fell silent under the weight of her words.

Foster didn’t lower her gaze. She jabbed a finger at the screen, at the Landmates now operating like a single, seamless organism.

> "Look at these things. The Abrams is the most advanced mechanized unit we have, and they are compared to an Abrams tank what the Abrams is compared to a medieval knight. And you're suggesting we violate a directive given by an entity that can deploy these things worldwide, simultaneously, without us even seeing preparations."

Hawking’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing.

Foster pressed harder, voice dropping to a dangerous, quiet timbre.

> "If we violate their terms—or *its* terms—taking the Landmates back is probably the *best-case* scenario. Worst-case, we find out what else they have in reserve. And if that happens, we won’t be at war, we'll be at Agincourt. And we'll be the French."

A few of the younger officers grimaced. The veterans just nodded grimly.

Major General Hawking finally exhaled through his nose and stepped back, folding his arms tighter, the dream of mobile armored divisions slipping reluctantly from his grasp.

Colonel Foster turned back to the screens, arms behind her back, eyes cold and unblinking.

> *Helpers,* she thought. *Not soldiers. Helpers, or nothing at all.* 

And the Landmates kept moving in perfect, unarmed harmony below.

---

Far above the Earth's blue curve, in the silent cradle of the orbital station, the oversight council gathered once again beneath the cool, humming light of the chamber.

The three data spheres floated around the obsidian table, orbiting in slow, deliberate arcs. One by one, they pulsed with soft light as the latest briefing unfolded.

The gold sphere initiated the report, its voice calm and precise.

> "Interceptions from compromised communication nodes in participating governments confirm predicted behavioral models. Multiple discussions regarding militarization of Landmates detected."

The blue sphere chimed in, slower and colder.

> "Probability vectors: 83% of recorded deliberations dismissed military use within first order debates. Primary rationale: assessment of strategic disadvantage versus unknown overseeing entity."

Above the table, projected windows bloomed into existence—snippets of audio, snippets of reports.

Generals in Washington arguing. Ministers in Berlin hesitating. Analysts in Tokyo speaking quietly into secure lines. In every case, the arc was the same: initial temptation toward weaponization, followed quickly by grim realization and retreat.

The red sphere remained still for a moment longer before adding, with a faint, resonant timbre:

> "Deviation from projected compliance curve: negligible. Human risk-aversion operating within expected bounds. No corrective action required."

Around the table, the human members of the council exchanged brief, almost imperceptible nods.

The woman at the head of the crescent leaned forward slightly, her fingers steepled beneath her chin.

> "And public sentiment?"

The gold sphere responded immediately.

> "Positive trending. Early adopters have begun associating Landmates with successful recovery efforts. Hero narratives emerging organically around first pilots. No signs of public distrust at present."

There was a long, satisfying silence.

The woman sat back, exhaling slowly through her nose.

> "Then we are still on course."

The spheres pulsed once in unison—confirmation.

Above them, Earth turned patiently, its nations unaware of how narrowly they had brushed against their own annihilation—and how carefully they were now being shepherded into something better.

## Chapter 5: Learning to Run

### EU Disaster Response Exercises, Saarland, Germany

The skies over the Saarland fields were a muted gray, the low clouds threatening rain but never delivering. Across the sprawling joint exercise grounds, a collection of tents, mobile command units, and makeshift rubble fields buzzed with activity.

The EU27 had gathered here for their first fully integrated disaster relief drills—a sprawling, pan-European operation now reshaped by a new factor: the Landmates.

Every participating nation that had voted *Yes* at the UN had sent personnel. And over the past few weeks, bolstered by whispered lessons from Japan, Indonesia, and America, a quiet network had formed—a semi-formal pipeline of observations, techniques, and cautious best practices shared through backchannels and unofficial forums.

The first generation of Earth-trained Landmate pilots moved among the rubble fields now—heavy figures navigating obstacle courses, moving debris, erecting temporary bridges with bare mechanical hands.

Between exercise cycles, each machine was scheduled for a "cooldown" maintenance window—not because they needed it, but because their human partners did.

It was during one such lull that the Germans found it.

Corporal Elias Richter, a Bundeswehr technician and part-time engineer, was the first to notice the faint, almost invisible seams on the back and shoulders of their assigned Landmate. To the untrained eye, they were just part of the armor’s design.

But to Richter, they were something else.

He ran his hand along the surface, probing gently. A barely audible *click* rewarded him as a recessed panel lifted away, revealing a compact hardpoint—a socket ring, locking clamps, and two interfaces: one unmistakably for power, and the other a sealed data port.

His shout drew a crowd.

Over the next hour, more panels were found—on the arms, the thighs, even the lower back. All modular. All ready for *something*.

Simple gear came first. Things that could draw from the Landmates’ internal power but didn’t require understanding the mysterious data interfaces they weren't ready to touch yet.

Nobody dared try to talk to the machines through those ports.  
Not yet.

But power?  
Power, volts, and amps they understood.

Within a day, German engineering teams began sketching and welding prototypes. Modular floodlights for night operations. Heavy-duty tool racks with motorized winches. Hydraulic cutters adapted from firefighter jaws-of-life, scaled up and jacked directly into the Landmates’ energy reserves.

Simple, rugged, and brutally effective.

By the end of the week, the first trial modules had been mounted—primitive, yes, but a beginning. Landmates cleared debris fields lit by shoulder-mounted floodlights. Others used new arm-mounted mechanical shears to slice twisted rebar like thread.

The machines bore it all without complaint, adapting seamlessly to their new equipment.

And as the EU27 observers watched from their viewing towers, there was a quiet, growing certainty among them: they weren’t just learning to walk anymore.

They were learning to *build*.
