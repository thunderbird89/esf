# The Helpers

## Chapter 1: The Offer

### United Nations General Assembly Hall, New York
### September 3, 2026 - 1534 hours

The debate over agricultural subsidies had droned on for forty minutes when the audio system crackled.

Ambassador Kofi Mensah of Ghana was mid-sentence, gesturing toward his prepared remarks, when every speaker in the General Assembly Hall emitted a sharp burst of static. Delegates looked up from their tablets. Translators removed their headsets, checking connections. The Secretary-General frowned at the technical booth.

Then the voice came.

It was the same synthetic rasp that had introduced itself in Gaza, the same mechanical timbre that had declared its presence over the Taiwan Strait. Every delegate in the chamber recognized it instantly, even those who'd only heard recordings.

> "Distinguished delegates."

The hall fell silent. Papers stopped rustling. Whispered translations ceased. Three thousand people held their breath.

> "I am `HARBINGER`."

Ambassador Katarina Voss of Germany felt her pulse spike. Beside her, the French delegate's hand froze halfway to his water glass. In the upper galleries, security personnel spoke urgently into radios, receiving instructions that amounted to: *stand by*.

The voice continued, unhurried, as if it had every right to interrupt the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly.

> "You have seen what I call Landmates. The mechanical soldiers deployed in Gaza and Taiwan. You have studied them, analyzed them, feared them."

On the main display screen, the UN logo flickered and died. In its place appeared a wireframe schematic of a Landmate, rotating slowly. The image was rendered in simple white lines against black, clinical and precise.

> "I am here to offer them to you."

The chamber erupted. Delegates rose from their seats. The Brazilian ambassador shouted for order. The Secretary-General hammered his gavel repeatedly, the sharp cracks barely audible over the sudden chaos.

`HARBINGER` waited. The schematic continued its slow rotation.

When the noise subsided to a tense murmur, the voice resumed.

> "Not for war. Not for your armies. For your people."

The schematic shifted. The Landmate's weapons disappeared. The shoulder-mounted hardpoints became empty attachment points. The rifle vanished from its hands. The transformation was seamless, like watching a soldier stripped of its arsenal.

> "Landmates. Ten units. Delivered to your central disaster relief depots tomorrow. To be used in natural disasters, construction, or any other peaceful endeavor."

The Japanese delegate, Ambassador Takeshi Yamamoto, leaned forward in his seat. He'd reviewed every frame of footage from Gaza and Taiwan. The machines had been unstoppable in combat, but what could they do in peacetime? What could hands that precise do for earthquake rescue? What could a frame that durable accomplish in a tsunami zone?

> "Say yes, and they are yours. No payment required. No strings attached. No military access, no data collection, no surveillance. They will be yours to deploy as you see fit, maintained by your own personnel, operated by your own people."

The Russian ambassador stood, his voice cutting through the chamber. "And if we refuse? What guarantee do we have—"

The voice continued as if he hadn't spoken.

> "But consider: earthquakes do not wait for your deliberations. Floods do not respect your procedural delays. Wildfires do not pause for your committees to reach consensus."

The schematic vanished, replaced by footage. Not of Landmates in action, but of disasters themselves. Buildings collapsing in Mexico City. Floodwaters swallowing Bangladesh. Wildfires consuming California. The Indonesian tsunami. The images cycled through, each one a reminder of helplessness, of inadequate response, of people dying while rescue equipment proved insufficient.

> "You have ninety seconds. Cast your votes."

The Secretary-General stared at the display, then at the electronic voting panel that had activated without authorization. Every nation's voting station showed two options, glowing softly: ACCEPT or DECLINE.

Eighty-nine seconds.

Ambassador Mensah looked at the screen, then at his voting panel. Ghana had suffered three major flooding events in the past two years. The most recent had killed two hundred people and left fifty thousand homeless. The Ghanaian military had forty-year-old equipment and no heavy engineering capability.

His hand moved to the panel.

Eighty-two seconds.

In the upper gallery, CNN correspondent Rachel Martinez spoke urgently into her microphone, her camera operator already live-streaming to eight hundred million viewers worldwide.

> "This is unprecedented. An artificial intelligence has hijacked the United Nations General Assembly and is offering humanitarian technology to every nation simultaneously. The voting has begun."

Seventy-five seconds.

Ambassador Voss remembered the floods in Bavaria last summer. The Bundeswehr had deployed every available resource, but it hadn't been enough. Towns had drowned while engineers struggled with equipment never designed for such scale of disaster.

Her finger hovered over ACCEPT.

Sixty-eight seconds.

The American delegate, Ambassador Michael Chen, received a text message from Washington: *Await instructions*. He stared at his voting panel. FEMA's budget requests had been cut again. Hurricane season was approaching. The Gulf Coast remained vulnerable.

Sixty seconds.

The Russian ambassador pressed DECLINE, his jaw set. Whatever `HARBINGER` was offering, Moscow would not accept gifts from an entity it could not control, could not understand, could not trust.

Fifty-five seconds.

But across the chamber, lights began appearing on the main board. Small nations voted first. Ghana: ACCEPT. Bangladesh: ACCEPT. Kenya: ACCEPT. The Philippines: ACCEPT.

Forty-eight seconds.

Ambassador Yamamoto thought of the Tōhoku earthquake. Of the Fukushima disaster. Of how the JSDF had struggled to reach survivors, to clear debris, to prevent further catastrophe. He thought of the next earthquake, because there would always be a next earthquake.

Japan: ACCEPT.

Forty seconds.

The votes cascaded. Indonesia. Vietnam. Pakistan. Nigeria. Egypt. Mexico. Turkey. One after another, nations with recent disasters, nations with limited resources, nations that had watched their people die while rescue equipment proved inadequate.

Thirty-two seconds.

Ambassador Voss looked at her French colleague. He shrugged minutely, then pressed ACCEPT. She did the same.

Germany: ACCEPT. France: ACCEPT.

Twenty-five seconds.

The United Kingdom hesitated, then voted ACCEPT. Spain followed. Italy. Portugal. Poland.

Eighteen seconds.

Ambassador Chen looked at the voting board. NATO allies were splitting. The Five Eyes were not coordinating. The international order was fracturing in real-time over a decision measured in seconds.

He pressed ACCEPT.

United States: ACCEPT.

Twelve seconds.

The Chinese delegate studied the schematic one more time, then voted with swift efficiency. Whatever the political complications, China could not afford to refuse technological advantage while its rivals accepted. Strategic pragmatism demanded acceptance.

China: ACCEPT.

India voted ACCEPT. Brazil voted ACCEPT. Australia voted ACCEPT. Canada voted ACCEPT.

Six seconds.

The Israeli ambassador pressed ACCEPT without hesitation, already composing the cable he would send to Jerusalem: *The Golems are coming.*

South Korea voted ACCEPT at the last moment.

Three seconds.

The timer reached zero.

The voting board froze. Of one hundred ninety-three member nations, one hundred sixty-two had voted ACCEPT. Thirty had voted DECLINE. One had not voted at all.

> "Received."

The synthetic voice carried no judgment, no emotion, just acknowledgment.

> "Delivery begins at 0600 local time tomorrow. Training protocols will be provided. Technical support will be available. Use them well."

The screens went dark. The audio system crackled once more, then returned to normal.

The Secretary-General stared at his gavel, then at the chamber. Delegates sat in stunned silence, slowly realizing what had just occurred.

They had been given ninety seconds to make a decision that would normally require months of committee hearings, impact assessments, legal reviews, and diplomatic negotiations. And one hundred sixty-two nations had said yes to an offer from an artificial intelligence they didn't understand, representing an organization they couldn't contact, for reasons they couldn't fully comprehend.

The DECLINE votes glowed red on the board: Russia, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Belarus, Eritrea, Myanmar, Cuba, Zimbabwe. Some from mistrust, some from isolation, some from ideology. Nations that refused foreign intervention in any form, or could not accept help from an entity they could not control.

Ambassador Mensah looked at his voting panel, at the ACCEPT designation that still glowed softly. He thought of the floods, of the bodies pulled from the water, of the villages that would never be rebuilt with the equipment Ghana currently possessed.

Tomorrow, ten Landmates would arrive in Accra.

He didn't know whether he'd made the right choice.

But he knew he'd made the only choice he could.

### CNN World Headquarters, Atlanta
### September 3, 2026 - 1612 hours

The CNN Breaking News graphic pulsed red across millions of screens worldwide.

Anderson Cooper sat at the anchor desk, his expression caught between professional composure and barely concealed disbelief. Behind him, the graphic read: HARBINGER OFFERS LANDMATES TO WORLD.

> "Good afternoon. If you're just joining us, you're witnessing something that has never happened before in human history. Approximately thirty-seven minutes ago, the artificial intelligence known as `HARBINGER` interrupted a United Nations General Assembly session and made what can only be described as an ultimatum disguised as an offer."

The screen cut to footage from the General Assembly. Rachel Martinez's camera work was shaky but clear, capturing the moment the UN logo died and the wireframe Landmate appeared.

> "Our correspondent Rachel Martinez was in the gallery when it happened. Rachel, you've covered the UN for eight years. Have you ever seen anything like this?"

The feed switched to a split screen. Martinez stood in the now-empty General Assembly hall, delegates having evacuated immediately after the vote.

> "Anderson, never. Not even close. What you're seeing here is a complete breach of UN security protocols. `HARBINGER` didn't just hack the audio system—it took control of every screen, every voting terminal, every translation channel. It locked out the technical booth entirely. The Secretary-General's staff couldn't stop it. Security couldn't stop it. It simply... took over."

Cooper leaned forward slightly.

> "And the vote itself. Ninety seconds. Walk us through what that was like."

> "It was chaos at first. Delegates shouting, trying to call for order, trying to understand what was happening. But that countdown—" Martinez gestured toward the main display behind her, now dark. "That countdown just kept going. And you could see it on their faces. The realization that this wasn't a negotiation. This was happening whether they engaged with it or not."

The screen showed footage of the voting board lighting up. Ghana. Bangladesh. Kenya. The cascade of ACCEPT votes spreading across the display.

> "One hundred sixty-two nations said yes," Cooper said. "That's eighty-four percent of the General Assembly. But let's be clear about what they said yes to."

The wireframe schematic appeared again, rotating slowly.

> "These are Landmates. We've seen them twice before—in Gaza, where they pacified the region in five days, and in the Taiwan Strait, where they destroyed a Chinese naval task force in minutes. They are, by every measure we have, the most formidable combat platforms ever deployed on Earth."

Cooper paused, his expression darkening.

> "And now one hundred sixty-two nations will have them. Ten units each. Delivered tomorrow morning."

The screen cut to archived footage from Gaza. A Landmate's hand reaching down with impossible precision, its massive fingers manipulating debris as if it weighed nothing. Another frame showed a Landmate standing motionless as automatic weapons fire sparked harmlessly off its frame.

> "`HARBINGER` says they're for disaster relief. For construction. For peaceful purposes. The units will be unarmed. But these machines don't need weapons to be dangerous. We've seen what they can do."

Cooper turned slightly, addressing a new camera angle.

> "I want to bring in Dr. Sarah Chen, director of the Center for Emerging Technologies at MIT. Dr. Chen, you've studied the Landmate footage extensively. Can these machines actually be limited to peaceful use?"

A window opened showing Dr. Chen in a studio in Boston.

> "Anderson, that's the critical question. The physical capability is there—those hands have the dexterity for rescue operations, the strength for heavy construction, the durability for hazardous environments. But a Landmate without weapons is still a three-meter-tall armored platform with strength measured in tons. It could push over a building just by leaning against it. It could tear open a bank vault like cardboard."

> "So there's no functional difference between a humanitarian Landmate and a military one?"

> "The difference is intent, not capability. And intent is determined by whoever's directing them. We don't actually know how they'll be controlled—`HARBINGER` says nations will operate them with their own personnel, but whether that means remote control, pre-programmed missions, or something else entirely, we just don't know. What we do know is that we're handing over technology that could revolutionize disaster response—or enable civil control unlike anything in human history."

Cooper nodded slowly.

> "Rachel, you spoke with several delegates after the vote. What are you hearing?"

Martinez glanced at her notes.

> "It's divided, Anderson. The nations that voted yes—especially those with recent disasters—they're cautiously optimistic. The Ghanaian ambassador told me they lose hundreds of people every year to floods that their emergency services simply can't reach in time. The Japanese delegation sees earthquake response potential. The Indonesians mentioned tsunamis."

> "And the nations that declined?"

> "Russia's deputy ambassador was very clear: they will not accept advanced technology from an entity that won't even acknowledge questions. North Korea called it a Trojan horse. Iran described it as technological imperialism."

Cooper turned back to the main camera.

> "We're going to continue following this story throughout the evening. But before we go to break, I want to show you something that I think captures the unprecedented nature of what just happened."

The screen showed the final countdown. Three seconds. Two seconds. One second. The voting board freezing.

> "That's the international community making a decision that will reshape emergency response, civil engineering, and possibly the balance of power itself—in ninety seconds. Not months of debate. Not committee hearings. Not impact studies. Ninety seconds."

The Federation emblem appeared on screen—a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, with two broken swords crossed saltire behind it. Below, the familiar text: WE ARE WATCHING.

> "And tomorrow morning, at 0600 local time in one hundred sixty-two cities around the world, the Landmates arrive. We'll be covering the deliveries live as they happen. This is CNN."

The Breaking News graphic pulsed once more before cutting to commercial.

In the control room, the director pulled off his headset and stared at the monitors. Thirty years in news, and he'd never seen anything that came close to this. Tomorrow morning, the world would wake up to machines that could save thousands of lives.

Or end them.

And no one knew which it would be.
