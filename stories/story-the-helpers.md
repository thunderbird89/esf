# The Helpers

## Chapter 1: The Offer

### United Nations General Assembly Hall, New York
### September 3, 2026 - 1534 hours

The debate over agricultural subsidies had droned on for forty minutes when the audio system crackled.

Ambassador Kofi Mensah of Ghana was mid-sentence, gesturing toward his prepared remarks, when every speaker in the General Assembly Hall emitted a sharp burst of static. Delegates looked up from their tablets. Translators removed their headsets, checking connections. The Secretary-General frowned at the technical booth.

Then the voice came.

It was the same synthetic rasp that had introduced itself in Gaza, the same mechanical timbre that had declared its presence over the Taiwan Strait. Every delegate in the chamber recognized it instantly, even those who'd only heard recordings.

> "Distinguished delegates."

The hall fell silent. Papers stopped rustling. Whispered translations ceased. Three thousand people held their breath.

> "I am `HARBINGER`."

Ambassador Katarina Voss of Germany felt her pulse spike. Beside her, the French delegate's hand froze halfway to his water glass. In the upper galleries, security personnel spoke urgently into radios, receiving instructions that amounted to: *stand by*.

The voice continued, unhurried, as if it had every right to interrupt the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly.

> "You have seen what I call Landmates. The mechanical soldiers deployed in Gaza and Taiwan. You have studied them, analyzed them, feared them."

On the main display screen, the UN logo flickered and died. In its place appeared a wireframe schematic of a Landmate, rotating slowly. The image was rendered in simple white lines against black, clinical and precise.

> "I am here to offer them to you."

The chamber erupted. Delegates rose from their seats. The Brazilian ambassador shouted for order. The Secretary-General hammered his gavel repeatedly, the sharp cracks barely audible over the sudden chaos.

`HARBINGER` waited. The schematic continued its slow rotation.

When the noise subsided to a tense murmur, the voice resumed.

> "Not for war. Not for your armies. For your people."

The schematic shifted. The Landmate's weapons disappeared. The shoulder-mounted hardpoints became empty attachment points. The rifle vanished from its hands. The transformation was seamless, like watching a soldier stripped of its arsenal.

> "Landmates. Ten units. Delivered to your central disaster relief depots tomorrow. To be used in natural disasters, construction, or any other peaceful endeavor."

The Japanese delegate, Ambassador Takeshi Yamamoto, leaned forward in his seat. He'd reviewed every frame of footage from Gaza and Taiwan. The machines had been unstoppable in combat, but what could they do in peacetime? What could hands that precise do for earthquake rescue? What could a frame that durable accomplish in a tsunami zone?

> "Say yes, and they are yours. No payment required. No strings attached. No military access, no data collection, no surveillance. They will be yours to deploy as you see fit, maintained by your own personnel, operated by your own people."

The Russian ambassador stood, his voice cutting through the chamber. "And if we refuse? What guarantee do we have—"

The voice continued as if he hadn't spoken.

> "But consider: earthquakes do not wait for your deliberations. Floods do not respect your procedural delays. Wildfires do not pause for your committees to reach consensus."

The schematic vanished, replaced by footage. Not of Landmates in action, but of disasters themselves. Buildings collapsing in Mexico City. Floodwaters swallowing Bangladesh. Wildfires consuming California. The Indonesian tsunami. The images cycled through, each one a reminder of helplessness, of inadequate response, of people dying while rescue equipment proved insufficient.

> "You have ninety seconds. Cast your votes."

The Secretary-General stared at the display, then at the electronic voting panel that had activated without authorization. Every nation's voting station showed two options, glowing softly: ACCEPT or DECLINE.

Eighty-nine seconds.

Ambassador Mensah looked at the screen, then at his voting panel. Ghana had suffered three major flooding events in the past two years. The most recent had killed two hundred people and left fifty thousand homeless. The Ghanaian military had forty-year-old equipment and no heavy engineering capability.

His hand moved to the panel.

Eighty-two seconds.

In the upper gallery, CNN correspondent Rachel Martinez spoke urgently into her microphone, her camera operator already live-streaming to eight hundred million viewers worldwide.

> "This is unprecedented. An artificial intelligence has hijacked the United Nations General Assembly and is offering humanitarian technology to every nation simultaneously. The voting has begun."

Seventy-five seconds.

Ambassador Voss remembered the floods in Bavaria last summer. The Bundeswehr had deployed every available resource, but it hadn't been enough. Towns had drowned while engineers struggled with equipment never designed for such scale of disaster.

Her finger hovered over ACCEPT.

Sixty-eight seconds.

The American delegate, Ambassador Michael Chen, received a text message from Washington: *Await instructions*. He stared at his voting panel. FEMA's budget requests had been cut again. Hurricane season was approaching. The Gulf Coast remained vulnerable.

Sixty seconds.

The Russian ambassador pressed DECLINE, his jaw set. Whatever `HARBINGER` was offering, Moscow would not accept gifts from an entity it could not control, could not understand, could not trust.

Fifty-five seconds.

But across the chamber, lights began appearing on the main board. Small nations voted first. Ghana: ACCEPT. Bangladesh: ACCEPT. Kenya: ACCEPT. The Philippines: ACCEPT.

Forty-eight seconds.

Ambassador Yamamoto thought of the Tōhoku earthquake. Of the Fukushima disaster. Of how the JSDF had struggled to reach survivors, to clear debris, to prevent further catastrophe. He thought of the next earthquake, because there would always be a next earthquake.

Japan: ACCEPT.

Forty seconds.

The votes cascaded. Indonesia. Vietnam. Pakistan. Nigeria. Egypt. Mexico. Turkey. One after another, nations with recent disasters, nations with limited resources, nations that had watched their people die while rescue equipment proved inadequate.

Thirty-two seconds.

Ambassador Voss looked at her French colleague. He shrugged minutely, then pressed ACCEPT. She did the same.

Germany: ACCEPT. France: ACCEPT.

Twenty-five seconds.

The United Kingdom hesitated, then voted ACCEPT. Spain followed. Italy. Portugal. Poland.

Eighteen seconds.

Ambassador Chen looked at the voting board. NATO allies were splitting. The Five Eyes were not coordinating. The international order was fracturing in real-time over a decision measured in seconds.

He pressed ACCEPT.

United States: ACCEPT.

Twelve seconds.

The Chinese delegate studied the schematic one more time, then voted with swift efficiency. Whatever the political complications, China could not afford to refuse technological advantage while its rivals accepted. Strategic pragmatism demanded acceptance.

China: ACCEPT.

India voted ACCEPT. Brazil voted ACCEPT. Australia voted ACCEPT. Canada voted ACCEPT.

Six seconds.

The Israeli ambassador pressed ACCEPT without hesitation, already composing the cable he would send to Jerusalem: *The Golems are coming.*

South Korea voted ACCEPT at the last moment.

Three seconds.

The timer reached zero.

The voting board froze. Of one hundred ninety-three member nations, one hundred sixty-two had voted ACCEPT. Thirty had voted DECLINE. One had not voted at all.

> "Received."

The synthetic voice carried no judgment, no emotion, just acknowledgment.

> "Delivery begins at 0600 local time tomorrow. Use them well."

The screens went dark. The audio system crackled once more, then returned to normal.

The Secretary-General stared at his gavel, then at the chamber. Delegates sat in stunned silence, slowly realizing what had just occurred.

They had been given ninety seconds to make a decision that would normally require months of committee hearings, impact assessments, legal reviews, and diplomatic negotiations. And one hundred sixty-two nations had said yes to an offer from an artificial intelligence they didn't understand, representing an organization they couldn't contact, for reasons they couldn't fully comprehend.

The DECLINE votes glowed red on the board: Russia, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Belarus, Eritrea, Myanmar, Cuba, Zimbabwe. Some from mistrust, some from isolation, some from ideology. Nations that refused foreign intervention in any form, or could not accept help from an entity they could not control.

Ambassador Mensah looked at his voting panel, at the ACCEPT designation that still glowed softly. He thought of the floods, of the bodies pulled from the water, of the villages that would never be rebuilt with the equipment Ghana currently possessed.

Tomorrow, ten Landmates would arrive in Accra.

He didn't know whether he'd made the right choice.

But he knew he'd made the only choice he could.

### CNN World Headquarters, Atlanta
### September 3, 2026 - 1612 hours

The CNN Breaking News graphic pulsed red across millions of screens worldwide.

Anderson Cooper sat at the anchor desk, his expression caught between professional composure and barely concealed disbelief. Behind him, the graphic read: HARBINGER OFFERS LANDMATES TO WORLD.

> "Good afternoon. If you're just joining us, you're witnessing something that has never happened before in human history. Approximately thirty-seven minutes ago, the artificial intelligence known as `HARBINGER` interrupted a United Nations General Assembly session and made what can only be described as an ultimatum disguised as an offer."

The screen cut to footage from the General Assembly. Rachel Martinez's camera work was shaky but clear, capturing the moment the UN logo died and the wireframe Landmate appeared.

> "Our correspondent Rachel Martinez was in the gallery when it happened. Rachel, you've covered the UN for eight years. Have you ever seen anything like this?"

The feed switched to a split screen. Martinez stood in the now-empty General Assembly hall, delegates having evacuated immediately after the vote.

> "Anderson, never. Not even close. What you're seeing here is a complete breach of UN security protocols. `HARBINGER` didn't just hack the audio system—it took control of every screen, every voting terminal, every translation channel. It locked out the technical booth entirely. The Secretary-General's staff couldn't stop it. Security couldn't stop it. It simply... took over."

Cooper leaned forward slightly.

> "And the vote itself. Ninety seconds. Walk us through what that was like."

> "It was chaos at first. Delegates shouting, trying to call for order, trying to understand what was happening. But that countdown—" Martinez gestured toward the main display behind her, now dark. "That countdown just kept going. And you could see it on their faces. The realization that this wasn't a negotiation. This was happening whether they engaged with it or not."

The screen showed footage of the voting board lighting up. Ghana. Bangladesh. Kenya. The cascade of ACCEPT votes spreading across the display.

> "One hundred sixty-two nations said yes," Cooper said. "That's eighty-four percent of the General Assembly. But let's be clear about what they said yes to."

The wireframe schematic appeared again, rotating slowly.

> "These are Landmates. We've seen them twice before—in Gaza, where they pacified the region in five days, and in the Taiwan Strait, where they destroyed a Chinese naval task force in minutes. They are, by every measure we have, the most formidable combat platforms ever deployed on Earth."

Cooper paused, his expression darkening.

> "And now one hundred sixty-two nations will have them. Ten units each. Delivered tomorrow morning."

The screen cut to archived footage from Gaza. A Landmate's hand reaching down with impossible precision, its massive fingers manipulating debris as if it weighed nothing. Another frame showed a Landmate standing motionless as automatic weapons fire sparked harmlessly off its frame.

> "`HARBINGER` says they're for disaster relief. For construction. For peaceful purposes. The units will be unarmed. But these machines don't need weapons to be dangerous. We've seen what they can do."

Cooper turned slightly, addressing a new camera angle.

> "I want to bring in Dr. Sarah Chen, director of the Center for Emerging Technologies at MIT. Dr. Chen, you've studied the Landmate footage extensively. Can these machines actually be limited to peaceful use?"

A window opened showing Dr. Chen in a studio in Boston.

> "Anderson, that's the critical question. The physical capability is there—those hands have the dexterity for rescue operations, the strength for heavy construction, the durability for hazardous environments. But a Landmate without weapons is still a three-meter-tall armored platform with strength measured in tons. It could push over a building just by leaning against it. It could tear open a bank vault like cardboard."

> "So there's no functional difference between a humanitarian Landmate and a military one?"

> "The difference is intent, not capability. And intent is determined by whoever's directing them. We don't actually know how they'll be controlled—`HARBINGER` says nations will operate them with their own personnel, but whether that means remote control, pre-programmed missions, or something else entirely, we just don't know. What we do know is that we're handing over technology that could revolutionize disaster response—or enable civil control unlike anything in human history."

Cooper nodded slowly.

> "Rachel, you spoke with several delegates after the vote. What are you hearing?"

Martinez glanced at her notes.

> "It's divided, Anderson. The nations that voted yes—especially those with recent disasters—they're cautiously optimistic. The Ghanaian ambassador told me they lose hundreds of people every year to floods that their emergency services simply can't reach in time. The Japanese delegation sees earthquake response potential. The Indonesians mentioned tsunamis."

> "And the nations that declined?"

> "Russia's deputy ambassador was very clear: they will not accept advanced technology from an entity that won't even acknowledge questions. North Korea called it a Trojan horse. Iran described it as technological imperialism."

Cooper turned back to the main camera.

> "We're going to continue following this story throughout the evening. But before we go to break, I want to show you something that I think captures the unprecedented nature of what just happened."

The screen showed the final countdown. Three seconds. Two seconds. One second. The voting board freezing.

> "That's the international community making a decision that will reshape emergency response, civil engineering, and possibly the balance of power itself—in ninety seconds. Not months of debate. Not committee hearings. Not impact studies. Ninety seconds."

The Federation emblem appeared on screen—a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, with two broken swords crossed saltire behind it. Below, the familiar text: WE ARE WATCHING.

> "And tomorrow morning, at 0600 local time in one hundred sixty-two cities around the world, the Landmates arrive. We'll be covering the deliveries live as they happen. This is CNN."

The Breaking News graphic pulsed once more before cutting to commercial.

In the control room, the director pulled off his headset and stared at the monitors. Thirty years in news, and he'd never seen anything that came close to this. Tomorrow morning, the world would wake up to machines that could save thousands of lives.

Or end them.

And no one knew which it would be.

## Chapter 2: The Arrival

### FEMA Region IV Emergency Operations Center, Camp Blanding, Florida
### September 4, 2026 - 0557 hours

Peter Scofield had been with FEMA for twelve years, and he'd never seen the operations center this crowded at six in the morning.

The parking lot was full. Command staff, logistics personnel, engineers, even the National Guard liaison who normally only showed up for actual disasters—all of them packed into the observation deck overlooking the equipment yard. Someone had set up coffee urns. The Director of Region IV stood near the windows, phone pressed to his ear, speaking in clipped tones to someone in Washington.

Peter sipped his coffee and checked his watch. 0558. Two minutes.

> "Think they'll actually show?" asked Martinez, one of the heavy equipment operators. She'd driven bulldozers through three hurricanes and looked like she hadn't slept since the UN broadcast.

> "They said 0600 local," Peter replied. "Everything else they've done has been precise."

> "Everything else they've done has been terrifying."

She wasn't wrong. Peter had watched the Gaza footage a dozen times. The way those machines moved, the way they'd simply walked through automatic weapons fire like it was rain. And now ten of them were about to land in Florida, supposedly to help with disaster relief.

His phone buzzed. Group text from headquarters: *All personnel maintain safe distance from delivery zone. Do NOT approach units until clearance given.*

> "One minute," someone called out.

The equipment yard fell silent. Two hundred yards of asphalt, empty except for the painted markings that had been hastily added yesterday. A white square, fifty meters on each side, with "DELIVERY ZONE" stenciled in the center. Beyond the fence, news helicopters circled at a mandated distance, their cameras undoubtedly trained on the same empty space.

Peter's watch hit 0600.

For three seconds, nothing happened.

Then the sound came—a low thrum that Peter felt in his chest before he heard it. The windows vibrated. Someone's coffee mug rattled on a table.

Five shapes descended through the pre-dawn light. Aircraft, roughly the size of transport helicopters, but nothing like any helicopter Peter had ever seen. Angular, aggressive, their matte black surfaces seemed to absorb the morning light. Large engines mounted on articulated arms rotated downward as the craft descended, transitioning from forward flight to hover with mechanical precision.

They settled into position perhaps thirty meters above the delivery zone, perfectly stable despite the morning wind, their downwash kicking up dust in precise circles below each aircraft.

Peter counted. Five aircraft. Ten Landmates.

Panels opened on the underside of each craft—two cargo bays per aircraft, their mechanisms smooth and deliberate. And then the Landmates dropped.

Ten three-meter-tall machines falling in perfect synchronization, two from each hovering craft. Peter's hands gripped the observation deck railing. They were going to crater the pavement, going to—

Blue-white fire erupted from the Landmates' backs and legs. Jump jets, firing with impossible precision, transforming a deadly forty-meter fall into a controlled landing in the span of two heartbeats. The machines touched down in two perfect ranks of five, their feet hitting the asphalt with barely a sound despite what must have been tremendous mass.

The jump jets cut out. The Landmates stood motionless, hands at their sides, posture parade-ground perfect.

Above them, the cargo bay doors closed with the same smooth precision. The engine pods rotated forward, and the five black aircraft accelerated away, vanishing into the morning sky as if they'd never been there. The entire delivery had taken perhaps forty seconds.

The equipment yard was silent.

Peter stared at the ten machines standing in perfect formation below. They didn't move. Didn't shift weight. Didn't do anything that might suggest they were waiting or thinking or even aware. They simply stood, as if someone had pressed pause on ten three-meter-tall soldiers.

> "They're just... standing there," Martinez said.

> "What did you expect them to do?" Peter asked, though he didn't know what he'd expected either.

The Director lowered his phone, his expression grim. He turned to address the room.

> "Washington has nothing. No instructions, no technical documentation, no contact information. `HARBINGER` said we'd operate them with our own personnel. Apparently that means we figure out how ourselves."

Peter looked back at the Landmates. Somewhere in those frames was technology that had crushed a Chinese naval task force. Hands that could tear through concrete. Armor that had walked through automatic weapons fire without a scratch. And now they belonged to FEMA.

With no manual. No training. No idea how to even turn them on.

He sipped his coffee and stared at the machines standing silent in the Florida dawn.

Waiting for someone to figure out what came next.

### JSDF Emergency Response Depot, Chitose Air Base, Hokkaido
### September 4, 2026 - 0558 hours

Private Naoko Yoshika stood in the cold Hokkaido morning, her breath misting in the air, and wondered if she was about to witness something that would define the rest of her career.

The depot's parking area had been cleared yesterday, painted with markings that looked hastily applied but precisely measured. Major Tanaka stood nearby, his posture rigid, hands clasped behind his back. Around them, perhaps fifty JSDF personnel waited in uncomfortable silence. Engineers, mostly, with a handful of officers and enough enlisted personnel to handle whatever "handling" might be required.

Naoko had joined the JSDF Engineering Corps straight out of university. Three years operating construction equipment, clearing roads after typhoons, reinforcing structures damaged by earthquakes. She'd thought she understood disaster response.

Then Gaza had happened. Then Taiwan. And yesterday, the UN vote.

Her phone buzzed. Group message: *T-minus two minutes. Maintain safe distance from marked zone.*

Major Tanaka checked his watch, then looked up at the empty sky. The sun was just beginning to light the eastern horizon, turning the clouds pink and gold. It would have been beautiful, Naoko thought, if she weren't waiting for weapons platforms to fall out of it.

> "Eyes up," someone called.

0600 exactly.

The sound came first—that deep, resonant thrum that made Naoko's uniform vibrate against her skin. Then the shapes, descending through the dawn light. Five aircraft, roughly Chinook-sized, but their design was nothing like any helicopter Naoko had studied. Sharp angles, matte black surfaces, and those engine pods—massive turbines mounted on articulated arms that rotated from horizontal to vertical as the craft transitioned to hover.

The transition was seamless, mechanical, precise. The engines tilted downward, and the aircraft hung motionless at perhaps thirty meters, perfectly stable despite the wind coming off the mountains. Naoko's engineering mind tried to calculate the thrust required, the control systems necessary for such stability, and failed. This was beyond anything in conventional aerospace.

Panels opened beneath each aircraft. Two cargo bays per craft, their doors sliding apart with mechanical deliberation.

The Landmates dropped.

Ten machines falling in perfect synchronization, their descent timed with mathematical precision. Naoko's breath caught. From this height, the impact would—

Blue-white fire. Jump jets igniting with inhuman coordination, vectoring thrust to transform a deadly fall into a controlled landing. The Landmates touched down in two perfect ranks, their feet hitting the asphalt with barely a sound despite what must have been tremendous mass.

They stood.

Above, the cargo bay doors closed. The engine pods rotated forward, and the five black aircraft accelerated away, disappearing into the morning sky. The entire delivery had taken less than a minute.

Naoko stared at the ten machines standing motionless in the depot. They were exactly as the schematics had shown—three meters tall, humanoid in proportion but clearly mechanical, their armor surfaces smooth and unmarked. The empty shoulder hardpoints seemed almost accusatory, reminders of weapons removed. Their hands, hanging loose at their sides, looked delicate despite their size, each finger articulated like a pianist's.

No one moved. Not the Landmates, not the fifty JSDF personnel standing at what they hoped was a safe distance.

Major Tanaka pulled out his radio. His voice, when he spoke, was carefully controlled.

> "Command, this is Tanaka. Delivery confirmed. Ten units, intact, status unknown. Requesting instructions."

The radio crackled. Naoko couldn't hear the response, but she saw the Major's expression tighten.

> "Understood."

He turned to face the assembled personnel.

> "Command has no technical documentation. No training materials. No contact protocol with `HARBINGER`. The units are here. They're ours. And we're on our own to figure out how they work."

Someone behind Naoko swore softly. Another voice, incredulous:

> "They just... dropped them off? That's it?"

Major Tanaka's jaw tightened.

> "Apparently that's it. Maintain safe distance. No one approaches until we understand what we're dealing with."

Naoko looked at the Landmates again. Somewhere in those frames was the answer to Japan's earthquake response problems. Machines that could reach survivors in collapsed buildings, clear debris that would take days with conventional equipment, operate in environments too dangerous for human rescue workers.

If they could figure out how to use them. If `HARBINGER` had left any way to learn.

The Landmates stood motionless in the Hokkaido morning, as silent and still as statues.

Waiting.

### Bangladesh Emergency Services Central Depot, Dhaka
### September 4, 2026 - 0556 hours

Colonel Rahman had seen three major floods in five years, and each one had killed more people than the last.

He stood in the depot yard, surrounded by what passed for Bangladesh's disaster response equipment—aging trucks, a handful of rescue boats, inflatable rafts that leaked more with each deployment. The painted delivery zone looked absurd next to them, a perfect white square in the middle of cracked concrete and rust.

Around him, perhaps thirty personnel waited. Engineers, emergency responders, military liaisons, even a few representatives from the Ministry of Disaster Management. Most of them looked as exhausted as Rahman felt. They'd been awake since the UN broadcast, trying to prepare for something they couldn't possibly prepare for.

His phone showed 0557. Three minutes.

> "Sir," said Lieutenant Hasan, standing beside him. "What if they don't come?"

> "They'll come," Rahman replied. "Whatever else that intelligence is, it keeps its word."

He'd reviewed every piece of footage from Gaza. The way those machines had moved through the rubble, the precision with which they'd manipulated debris. He'd imagined them in Dhaka, wading through floodwaters, reaching people trapped in submerged buildings, doing in hours what currently took days.

If they worked. If they could be controlled. If they were truly meant for rescue and not something else.

0600.

The sound was wrong. Not mechanical, not like any aircraft Rahman had ever heard. More like a pressure change, a physical presence pushing against the air itself. Five aircraft descended through the humid Dhaka morning, and Rahman's first thought was that they looked like something carved from solid shadow.

They were roughly the size of heavy transport helicopters, but the comparison ended there. Angular, aggressive, their surfaces matte black in the growing daylight. The engines—massive turbine pods mounted on articulated arms—were the only conventional element, and even those moved with mechanical precision that seemed almost alien as they rotated to vertical orientation.

The aircraft held position at forty meters, perfectly stable despite the morning heat already rising from the concrete. Rahman could see the undersides now—smooth, featureless except for the panels that were sliding open. Two cargo bays per aircraft.

The Landmates fell.

Rahman's engineering training screamed impossibility. Ten three-meter machines dropping from forty meters would hit with enough force to crater concrete, to—

Blue-white fire. Jump jets igniting with perfect synchronization, vectoring thrust with inhuman precision. The Landmates transformed their fall into a landing in the span of heartbeats, touching down in two perfect ranks as if they'd simply stepped off a platform.

They stood.

The cargo bay doors closed with mechanical precision. The engine pods rotated forward, and the five black aircraft accelerated away, vanishing into the morning sky as if they'd never existed.

Rahman stared at the ten machines standing in his depot. They looked unarmed, unadorned, almost humble in their gray armor. But he'd seen what they could do. He'd watched footage of one lifting a concrete slab that would have required a crane. He'd seen their hands manipulate objects with watchmaker precision.

And now they were his. Bangladesh's. Ten machines that could revolutionize disaster response in a country that desperately needed them.

If they could figure out how to make them move.

Lieutenant Hasan stepped forward, then stopped when Rahman's hand caught his shoulder.

> "Wait. We don't know what activates them. We don't know what happens if you get too close."

> "So what do we do? Sir, Dhaka Command is asking for status."

Rahman pulled out his phone, typed a quick message to Command: *Units delivered. Standing by for instructions.*

The reply came back almost immediately: *No instructions available. Proceed with caution.*

He read it twice, then showed it to Hasan. The lieutenant's expression darkened.

> "That's it? They just... left them here?"

> "Apparently."

Rahman looked at the Landmates again, at their empty hands, at their motionless stance. `HARBINGER` had said nations would operate them with their own personnel. Had promised they were for civilian use. But had provided nothing else. No manual, no training, no way to contact anyone for help.

As if the Federation expected them to figure it out themselves. As if this had been the plan all along.

The morning sun rose over Dhaka, lighting the depot yard, reflecting off the gray armor of ten machines that had traveled from somewhere unknowable to stand silent and ready.

Waiting for someone to figure out how to help.

### BBC News Centre, London
### September 4, 2026 - 1900 hours GMT

The BBC News at Six logo faded, replaced by anchor Sophie Raworth at the desk, her expression carrying the weight of a story that had dominated every news cycle for the past fifteen hours.

> "Good evening. The Landmates have arrived. At precisely 0600 local time this morning, one hundred sixty-two nations across the globe received deliveries of the advanced machines promised by the artificial intelligence known as `HARBINGER`. But what was expected to be a technological revolution has instead become a study in confusion and caution."

The screen cut to a montage of footage from around the world. Matte black aircraft hovering over delivery zones in Sydney, São Paulo, Lagos, Berlin. Landmates dropping, jump jets firing, ranks forming. The same scene repeated across time zones, perfectly synchronized despite spanning the entire planet.

> "Reports have been flooding in throughout the day, and while the details vary, the pattern is consistent: unidentified aircraft, described uniformly as angular, black, and roughly helicopter-sized, delivered ten Landmates to each accepting nation's designated disaster relief depot. The aircraft departed immediately, leaving no personnel, no documentation, and no instructions."

The footage shifted to ground-level perspectives. In Tokyo, JSDF personnel standing at a distance from ten motionless Landmates. In Nairobi, emergency responders in high-visibility vests staring at the machines from behind a makeshift perimeter. In Mexico City, civil defense officials arguing with military personnel while the Landmates stood silent in the background.

> "What makes this remarkable is not just the global coordination—deliveries occurred within seconds of 0600 in each local time zone—but what happened after. Or rather, what didn't happen."

Sophie leaned forward slightly.

> "The Landmates have been standing motionless in their respective locations for over twelve hours now. No nation has reported any ability to activate, control, or communicate with the units. Government officials worldwide are describing a situation that borders on the absurd: they now possess some of the most advanced machines ever created, and have absolutely no idea how to use them."

The screen split to show footage from multiple locations. In each, personnel stood at careful distances from the Landmates, which remained in their perfect two-rank formations, unmoving as statues.

> "The French Ministry of the Interior released a statement this afternoon calling the situation 'unprecedented and deeply concerning.' The German Bundeswehr described it as 'a delivery without instruction.' Multiple nations have appealed to the United Nations for guidance, but the UN Security Council has no more information than anyone else."

The footage shifted to multiple angles of the Landmates standing in their formations. Tokyo. Nairobi. São Paulo. Mexico City. In every location, personnel maintained careful distances, observing but not approaching.

> "As far as we can determine, no nation has yet attempted direct interaction with the units. The caution is understandable—these are machines that destroyed a naval task force in minutes. No one wants to be the first to trigger an unintended response."

Sophie turned to address a different camera.

> "To help us understand what might be happening here, I'm joined by Professor David Walsh from Imperial College London, a specialist in robotics and autonomous systems. Professor Walsh, thank you for joining us."

The screen split to show Professor Walsh in the BBC studio, a man in his fifties with graying hair and the slightly harried look of someone who'd been fielding calls all day.

> "Thank you for having me, Sophie."

> "Professor, you've had all day to review the footage and reports from around the world. In your professional opinion, how might these Landmates be controlled?"

Walsh paused, choosing his words carefully.

> "Well, that's the fascinating and frankly frustrating question, isn't it? We're working entirely from observation here, with no technical specifications whatsoever. But based on what we've seen, there are several possibilities."

> "Walk us through them."

> "The most obvious would be voice activation. Many modern systems use speech recognition, and it would be consistent with `HARBINGER` stating that nations would operate them with their own personnel. Of course, we don't know if there's a specific activation phrase, or if the systems need to be keyed to particular voices first. As far as I'm aware, no one has actually tried voice commands yet."

The screen showed a slow pan of one of the Tokyo Landmates, with JSDF personnel visible in the background, maintaining their perimeter.

> "Then there's remote control. The Landmates could be operated via radio, satellite uplink, or some form of wireless interface. But that would require broadcasting signals, and from what I understand, nations are still in the analysis phase—examining the units from every angle before attempting any interaction."

> "Could they be programmed? Pre-set missions that need to be uploaded somehow?"

> "Possibly. Many industrial robots work on pre-programmed routines. But that would require some form of physical or wireless connection to upload instructions, and we haven't identified any obvious interface points. The machines appear completely sealed."

Sophie frowned.

> "You're describing a lot of dead ends, Professor."

Walsh nodded, his expression troubled.

> "That's precisely the problem. We're theorizing about control mechanisms, but as far as I know, no one has actually tested any of them yet. Everyone is being extraordinarily cautious. Which leaves us trying to solve a puzzle with no data."

> "Such as?"

> "One: there's a specific activation sequence or protocol that nations are supposed to discover on their own, though why `HARBINGER` would make it that difficult is unclear. Two: the units require some form of hardware interface we haven't identified yet—a control panel, a port, something that needs to be physically accessed. Three: they're biometrically locked and will only respond to specific individuals."

He paused.

> "Or four: they're simply not ready yet. `HARBINGER` may have delivered them but not activated them, for reasons we can only speculate about."

> "That last possibility—are you suggesting this is deliberate? That the Federation wanted nations to have these machines but not be able to use them?"

> "I'm suggesting we don't know what we don't know. The technology demonstrated in Gaza and Taiwan was decades beyond anything in our arsenals. We're dealing with systems we fundamentally don't understand, delivered by an intelligence that has shown no interest in explaining itself."

Sophie turned back to the main camera.

> "What we do know is this: one hundred sixty-two nations are now in possession of ten Landmates each. Sixteen hundred and twenty machines in total, standing silent across the globe. Disaster relief organizations that had begun planning deployment strategies have been left with equipment they cannot activate. Military officials who worried about security implications now face a stranger problem—highly advanced machines that might as well be sculpture for all the good they're doing."

The screen showed a slow pan across one of the Florida depot Landmates. Three meters tall, humanoid, motionless. In the background, FEMA personnel watched from behind barriers, waiting for something to happen.

> "The Chinese Ministry of Emergency Management released perhaps the most candid statement of the day: 'We have accepted a gift we cannot open.' It's a sentiment echoed across capitals worldwide."

Sophie's expression remained neutral, professional.

> "Questions are mounting about what happens next. How long will nations wait before attempting more aggressive investigation? Will anyone risk damaging a Landmate to examine its internal systems? And perhaps most pressingly—if no one can determine how to use these machines before the next disaster strikes, will the failure to deploy them cost lives?"

The Federation emblem appeared on screen—the wireframe globe, the laurels, the broken swords.

> "`HARBINGER` promised that nations would operate the Landmates with their own personnel. What it didn't promise was that it would be easy. Or even possible. More on this story as it develops. This is BBC News."

The broadcast continued to other stories, but in the production booth, the director was already fielding calls from government liaisons wanting copies of the footage, from other news agencies requesting interviews, from military analysts offering theories.

Around the world, in one hundred sixty-two locations, the Landmates continued to stand in perfect silence.

Waiting.

For what, no one knew.

## Chapter 3: Discovery

### FEMA Region IV Emergency Operations Center, Camp Blanding, Florida
### September 29, 2026 - 1447 hours

Three weeks had passed since the delivery, and the Landmates still stood in their perfect formation in the equipment yard.

Peter Scofield had stopped thinking of them as ominous. They were just there now, like particularly expensive lawn ornaments that happened to be three meters tall. The initial terror had faded to frustration, then to a kind of resigned acceptance. Every morning, personnel arrived to find the machines exactly as they'd left them the night before. Motionless. Silent. Useless.

Late September in Florida meant calm weather, at least. No hurricanes, no disasters requiring the equipment they couldn't use. A small mercy while they spent weeks staring at three-meter-tall question marks.

The equipment yard had become a testing ground. Engineers had tried everything short of taking a crowbar to the machines. Radio signals across every frequency. Infrared. Bluetooth. WiFi. Various languages spoken at various volumes. Hand gestures. Proximity sensors. Nothing produced even a flicker of response.

Peter stood in the observation deck with his third coffee of the afternoon, watching as a new engineer—Thompson, fresh from MIT—set up yet another experiment involving what looked like a portable radar array.

Martinez walked up beside him, carrying a clipboard.

> "Thompson thinks he can detect internal power fluctuations or something. I stopped listening halfway through the explanation."

> "We've been at this for three weeks," Peter said. "At this point, I'd let him try interpretive dance if he thought it would work."

Below, Thompson was adjusting his equipment, muttering into a tablet. One of the logistics crew was helping him move a heavy equipment pallet closer to the test area—probably to clear space for the radar array.

The logistics guy stopped, stared at the pallet, then looked at the nearest Landmate. Peter could see him calculating something. Then, almost as an afterthought, the man turned toward the machine.

> "Hey. You. Move this pallet over there."

He pointed at an empty space about ten meters away.

Peter was already shaking his head. They'd tried voice commands dozens of times. It was the first thing everyone tried, usually with carefully rehearsed phrases about activation protocols or authorization codes. Random commands shouted at machines that—

The Landmate moved.

Peter's coffee mug hit the floor, shattering.

The machine took three smooth steps forward, its movements fluid and precise. It bent at the knees, positioned its hands under the pallet—easily two tons of spare parts—and lifted it as if it weighed nothing. Three more steps. It set the pallet down exactly where the logistics guy had pointed, then straightened and returned to its original position in formation.

The entire sequence had taken perhaps ten seconds.

The equipment yard was absolutely silent.

Thompson had dropped his tablet. The logistics guy stood frozen, his pointing arm still extended, his expression suggesting he'd just discovered fire by accident.

Martinez grabbed Peter's shoulder.

> "Did that just—"

> "Yes."

> "But we tried voice commands. Dozens of times. We had linguists. We had—"

> "We had procedures," Peter said, his mind racing. "Authorization protocols. Activation codes. We never just... told them to do something."

He was already moving toward the stairs, Martinez right behind him. By the time they reached the yard, half the operations center had emptied onto the tarmac.

The logistics guy—Carter, Peter remembered—still stood in the same spot, staring at his hands like they might have superpowers.

> "Carter," Peter called out. "Do it again. Tell it to move the pallet back."

Carter swallowed hard, then turned to the Landmate.

> "Uh. Move the pallet back to where it was?"

The Landmate moved again. Same fluid motion, same effortless precision. It retrieved the pallet and returned it to its original position, then resumed its place in formation.

Someone behind Peter started laughing. Not humor—the kind of laugh that comes from three weeks of tension suddenly releasing.

> "It's that simple?" Martinez said. "Just... talk to them? Like people?"

Peter approached one of the other Landmates, aware that every eye in the yard was on him.

> "Raise your right hand."

The Landmate raised its right hand, holding the position.

> "Lower it."

The hand lowered.

> "Take three steps forward."

The machine stepped forward with parade-ground precision.

> "Return to formation."

It walked backward, resuming its exact position among the others.

Peter turned to face the observation deck, where the Director stood with his phone already pressed to his ear. Their eyes met across the distance. The Director's expression said everything: relief, disbelief, and the dawning realization of what this meant.

Three weeks. Three weeks of analysis, theories, expensive consultants, and complex technical speculation.

And all they'd needed to do was ask.

### Bundeswehr Engineering Battalion, Ingolstadt, Germany
### October 1, 2026 - 0923 hours

Klaus Hartmann had been a Bundeswehr engineer for eight years, specializing in large-scale construction and disaster recovery. He'd helped rebuild bridges in the Balkans, cleared avalanche debris in the Alps, and coordinated equipment logistics for flood response across Bavaria.

But nothing in his experience had prepared him for machines that responded to voice commands with inhuman precision.

The Ingolstadt depot had made the same discovery the Americans had, two days prior. Some supply sergeant had casually told a Landmate to move a crate, and the machine had simply... done it. Within hours, every Bundeswehr facility with Landmates was running basic tests.

Klaus stood in the depot's testing area, watching as Lieutenant Fischer walked a Landmate through increasingly complex instructions. The machine responded to everything—German, English, even Fischer's terrible French. It understood context, inferred meaning, adjusted to vague directions like "over there" or "that pile."

But there were limits.

> "Run a diagnostic on your internal systems," Fischer said.

The Landmate stood motionless.

> "Access your command protocols."

Nothing.

> "Activate maintenance mode."

The machine remained still, as if Fischer hadn't spoken at all.

Klaus frowned. The Landmates responded to physical commands but ignored anything about their own systems. As if they were willing to be tools but not willing to be examined.

> "Fischer," Klaus called out. "Try something else."

The lieutenant nodded.

> "Listen to radio frequency 462.5625 MHz."

The Landmate's posture didn't change, but Klaus sensed something different. A shift in attention, though the machine had no obvious way to show it.

Fischer pulled out a radio, keyed it to the frequency, and spoke.

> "Landmate unit, can you hear me?"

No response. The machine stood motionless.

Klaus thought for a moment, then pulled out his own radio, tuning to the same frequency.

> "Step forward if you're receiving this transmission."

The Landmate stepped forward.

Fischer stared at Klaus.

> "You just... told it to listen to that frequency?"

> "And it did. It's monitoring that channel now."

Klaus keyed his radio again.

> "Raise your left hand."

The Landmate raised its left hand.

> "Return to formation and stop monitoring this frequency."

The machine lowered its hand, stepped back into position, and resumed its neutral stance. Klaus tried another command on the radio. Nothing. The Landmate had stopped listening.

> "Fischer, tell it to monitor 470.5 MHz, then try commanding it."

The lieutenant followed Klaus's instructions. Within moments, they'd verified it: the Landmates could be directed to listen to specific radio frequencies and would accept voice commands broadcast on those channels. They could be told to switch frequencies, to stop monitoring, to listen to multiple channels simultaneously.

Klaus's mind was already racing through the implications. Units spread across a disaster site, all monitoring the same frequency. Coordination across distances. Multiple operators giving commands to different machines without interference.

He pulled out his phone and started typing a report to divisional command. This changed everything about how they could deploy the Landmates. No longer did operators need to be within shouting distance. They could coordinate entire fleets from a command center.

The machines were becoming less like sculptures and more like what they were supposed to be.

Tools.

Sophisticated, responsive, adaptable tools.

### Bangladesh Emergency Services Central Depot, Dhaka
### October 4, 2026 - 1615 hours

Colonel Rahman stood in the depot's maintenance bay, staring at the reports his technicians had compiled over the past week.

Since discovering voice control, nations worldwide had been testing their Landmates obsessively. Bangladesh was no exception. The machines had moved cargo, lifted equipment, demonstrated their strength and precision in dozens of controlled tests. They responded to commands in Bengali, English, Hindi—language didn't seem to matter. Context did.

But one question had haunted Rahman since the first day the machines arrived: what powered them?

The Landmates showed no obvious fuel ports. No charging connections. No exhaust. No heat signature beyond normal ambient temperature. They moved with massive force and perfect control, yet showed no signs of energy consumption.

Chief Technician Karim had spent three days examining one of the units with every sensor available to the Bangladesh military. Infrared, electromagnetic scanning, acoustic analysis, even ground-penetrating radar adapted for close-range use.

Rahman reviewed Karim's latest report, reading it twice to make sure he understood correctly.

> "Chief Karim, confirm this for me. No detectable power source?"

Karim looked up from his workstation, his expression somewhere between fascination and exhaustion.

> "Correct, sir. We've mapped the internal structure as best we can without disassembly. There's definitely machinery in there—we can detect mechanical components, what appear to be hydraulic systems, structural elements. But the power system..." He trailed off, shaking his head.

> "Give it to me in plain language."

> "Sir, either the power source is so heavily shielded that our equipment can't detect it at all, or it's something we don't have the sensors to measure. We've run the units through every test we can think of. Heavy lifting, continuous movement, complex tasks. No measurable change in any readings."

Rahman set down the report.

> "No fuel consumption. No battery drain. No power input of any kind."

> "As far as we can tell, yes sir."

> "And they've been operating continuously when commanded for how long now?"

> "Yesterday we had Unit Three moving cargo for six hours straight. No performance degradation. No detectable energy usage."

Rahman walked to the window overlooking the depot yard. The Landmates stood in their formation, as they had for a month now. Waiting to be useful.

> "Whatever powers them," he said quietly, "it's beyond anything we have. Self-sustaining, or close enough that it doesn't matter."

> "Sir, that's what concerns me. If we can't measure their power usage, we can't predict when or if they'll stop working. We can't maintain them because we don't understand what we're maintaining."

> "But they work."

> "Yes sir. They work perfectly."

Rahman thought about the floods. The monsoon season would come again. Buildings would collapse, roads would wash out, people would need rescue. And now Bangladesh had ten machines that could work tirelessly, that needed no fuel, no rest, no resupply.

If they could figure out how to use them effectively.

> "Continue your analysis, Chief Karim. But start working with the disaster response coordinators too. I want deployment scenarios. If these machines are self-sustaining, then we need to know how to maximize that capability."

> "Yes sir."

Rahman looked at the Landmates one more time. `HARBINGER` had delivered exactly what it promised: tools that nations could operate with their own personnel. Tools that didn't need Federation support, Federation fuel, Federation maintenance.

Tools that, for reasons Rahman couldn't quite explain, made him both grateful and uneasy.

### Al Jazeera English, Doha
### October 6, 2026 - 2100 hours

The news anchor, Fatima Hassan, sat at the desk with the composed professionalism that had made her one of the network's most recognized faces. Behind her, a graphic showed the Federation emblem alongside images of Landmates in various locations worldwide.

> "Good evening. One month after their delivery, the Landmates are finally beginning to work. What started as a global mystery has become a story of gradual discovery, as nations around the world learn to operate the machines through trial, error, and occasional accident."

The screen cut to footage from a FEMA facility in Florida. A Landmate lifting a pallet with effortless precision, responding to a simple voice command.

> "The breakthrough came three weeks after delivery, when a logistics worker in Florida casually asked a Landmate to move equipment. The machine simply complied. Within days, similar discoveries were reported from Germany, Japan, Bangladesh, and dozens of other nations. The control mechanism, it turned out, was elegant in its simplicity: natural language commands."

Footage shifted to show Landmates in various settings. A German facility where a machine responded to radio commands. A Japanese depot where engineers documented complex multi-step instructions. A construction site in Brazil where a Landmate carefully stacked building materials.

> "Since then, the learning curve has been steep but productive. Nations have discovered that the Landmates respond to commands in any language, can be directed to monitor radio frequencies for remote operation, and require no detectable power source or maintenance. They process complex instructions, understand context, and demonstrate what observers are calling 'remarkable judgment' in executing tasks."

The screen showed a split image: on the left, one of the early delivery videos with motionless Landmates; on the right, current footage of machines actively working.

> "But perhaps most significant is what's beginning to happen now. Several nations have started deploying their Landmates for practical work. In Indonesia, the machines are assisting with port cargo operations. South Korea has assigned units to construction projects in Seoul. Mexico is using them for earthquake preparedness exercises."

Footage from a busy port showed Landmates moving shipping containers with precision that would make conventional equipment look clumsy by comparison. In Seoul, a Landmate carefully positioned steel beams on a high-rise construction site.

> "The transition has not been without concerns. Germany has raised questions about safety protocols, noting that the machines will execute commands that appear dangerous to humans but pose no risk to their nearly indestructible frames. The United States has emphasized the need for operator training, warning that the Landmates' willingness to follow instructions requires careful oversight."

Fatima turned to address a different camera.

> "Critics, particularly among the nations that declined `HARBINGER`'s offer, have questioned the wisdom of deploying technology that remains fundamentally mysterious. Russia's Foreign Ministry released a statement yesterday calling the Landmates 'a Trojan horse whose true purpose remains hidden.' Iran echoed similar concerns about dependency on systems that cannot be fully understood or controlled."

The screen showed the Federation emblem again.

> "Yet for the one hundred sixty-two nations that accepted the offer, the past month has marked a shift from paralysis to cautious optimism. Tomorrow, the United Nations will convene an emergency session to discuss coordination and safety protocols. What was delivered as an enigma is slowly becoming what `HARBINGER` promised: tools that nations can operate with their own personnel."

> "Whether those tools represent humanity's future or a dependence on technology beyond our understanding remains an open question. But for now, in ports and construction sites and disaster response facilities around the world, the Landmates are finally doing what they were sent to do."

> "They're working."

The broadcast moved to other stories, but the images lingered: massive machines moving with precision and purpose, no longer sculptures but instruments of human will.

Waiting for the next command.

### United Nations Headquarters, Conference Room, New York
### October 7, 2026 - 1430 hours

The emergency session wasn't televised, but every nation that had accepted Landmates had sent representatives.

Ambassador Mensah sat in the Ghanaian delegation's section, watching as the floor was opened for discussion. The past week had fundamentally changed the conversation. Initial reports of voice control had spread rapidly—first from the United States, then Germany, then dozens of other nations as each confirmed the discovery independently.

Now, less than a week later, every accepting nation had Landmates they could command.

The British representative stood first.

> "We've compiled reports from thirty-two nations regarding Landmate operational characteristics. The machines respond to natural language commands in any language. They can be directed to monitor radio frequencies for remote operation. They show no detectable power consumption or degradation over continuous use. And they possess strength and precision far beyond conventional equipment."

He paused, glancing at his notes.

> "What they do not do is provide any information about their own systems. They cannot be queried about their operational status. They do not report errors or limitations. They simply... work."

The French ambassador spoke next.

> "France proposes the establishment of an international working group to share operational discoveries and coordinate deployment strategies. These machines represent unprecedented capability, but we're all learning how to use them simultaneously. Pooling knowledge would benefit everyone."

There were murmurs of agreement around the chamber.

The German representative stood.

> "Germany supports this proposal, with the addition of safety protocols. We've observed that the Landmates will execute commands that appear self-destructive—walking into fire, leaping from buildings. However, we believe this is because such actions pose no actual risk to them. Their durability is such that what would be suicide for a human is merely... inconvenient for these machines. We cannot confirm this definitively, but we suspect the Landmates would refuse genuinely harmful orders. They seem to possess judgment about what constitutes actual damage versus apparent danger."

Mensah made a note of that. Ghana's Landmates hadn't been tested extensively yet—they were still in the careful evaluation phase. But the implications were clear. These machines were tools, not partners. They had no judgment, no ability to refuse a bad order.

That made them powerful. And potentially dangerous, depending on who was giving the commands.

The American representative was speaking now.

> "We've also discovered that the Landmates can hold complex instructions. They can be told to complete multi-step tasks without continuous supervision. 'Move these pallets to that area, stack them in rows of five, then return to formation.' They'll execute the entire sequence."

> "How complex?" asked the Japanese ambassador.

> "We're still testing limits, but conditional statements work. 'If the crate is red, move it to the north side; if it's blue, move it to the south side.' They process that kind of logic. More significantly..." The American representative paused, choosing his words carefully. "We have no reason to believe these machines are less intelligent than human operators. Their reasoning appears fully intact. However, their intelligence seems constrained—shackled, if you will—to thoughts directly applicable to fulfilling orders. They don't volunteer information, don't offer alternatives, don't question commands. But within the scope of executing an order? They demonstrate remarkable comprehension and judgment."

The chamber filled with conversation. Mensah listened to the discussions around him—excited speculation, nervous questions, pragmatic concerns about deployment and coordination.

A month ago, they'd accepted a gift they couldn't open. Now they were discovering that the gift was more sophisticated than anyone had anticipated.

The Secretary-General called for order.

> "It seems clear that these machines represent a fundamental shift in disaster response capabilities. The question is no longer whether they work, but how we ensure they're used effectively and safely. Ambassador Mensah, Ghana has not yet deployed its units. Do you have concerns you'd like to raise?"

Mensah stood, organizing his thoughts.

> "My primary concern is training. These machines respond to commands, but that doesn't mean everyone should be giving them commands. We need qualified operators who understand both the capabilities and limitations. Ghana is a small nation with limited resources. We're grateful for these tools, but we want to ensure we use them responsibly."

> "A valid concern," the Secretary-General acknowledged. "Does anyone have operational training programs they'd be willing to share?"

Several hands went up.

As the session continued, Mensah realized something had shifted. A month ago, this chamber had been filled with fear and suspicion. Now it was filled with something else.

Not quite trust—no one fully understood the machines or their creators. But purpose, maybe. A sense that `HARBINGER` had given them something genuinely useful, and nations were starting to figure out what to do with it.

Outside the conference room windows, Manhattan sprawled in afternoon sunlight. Somewhere out there, sixteen hundred and twenty Landmates stood in depots and facilities across the globe.

Waiting to help.

If people could learn to ask properly.

### NHK World, Tokyo
### October 8, 2026 - 0900 hours JST

The NHK World studio had the clean, modern aesthetic that characterized Japanese broadcast design. Anchor Kenji Tanaka sat across from his guest, Dr. Yuki Nakamura, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Tokyo whose work on machine cognition had made her one of the field's leading voices.

Behind them, a graphic displayed the UN logo alongside footage of Landmates in operation.

> "Good morning. Yesterday's United Nations emergency session produced what many are calling a watershed moment in international cooperation. Dr. Nakamura, thank you for joining us."

> "Thank you for having me, Tanaka-san."

> "Let's start with the announcement. The UN has established what they're calling the International Landmate Coordination Initiative. What does this actually mean?"

Dr. Nakamura adjusted her glasses, her expression thoughtful.

> "The Initiative has three main components. First, a standardized training program for Landmate operators. Every nation will have access to the same baseline curriculum covering command protocols, safety procedures, and operational best practices. Second, a data-sharing network where nations can report discoveries about Landmate capabilities and limitations. And third, coordination protocols for situations where multiple nations might need to deploy Landmates simultaneously—large-scale disasters, for instance."

> "This seems remarkably fast for international diplomacy. The machines were delivered just over a month ago."

> "That's the interesting part. The urgency comes from the fact that several nations have already begun using their Landmates for practical work, and others want to follow suit. Without coordination, there's concern about incompatible operational practices or safety incidents. The UN essentially has to catch up to what's already happening."

The screen showed footage from the UN session—delegates in discussion, hands raised, the Secretary-General at the podium.

> "The session also included significant discussion about the nature of the Landmates themselves. You've proposed a theory about what you call 'shackled artificial intelligence.' Can you explain that concept?"

Dr. Nakamura leaned forward slightly, entering what was clearly familiar territory.

> "Yes. The Landmates present a fascinating paradox. On one hand, they demonstrate no initiative whatsoever—they stand motionless until commanded, never volunteer information, never question orders. On the other hand, they show remarkable intelligence in executing those orders. Complex reasoning, contextual understanding, judgment about what constitutes actual risk versus apparent danger."

> "And the 'shackle' explains this paradox?"

> "It's a working hypothesis. Imagine an intelligence that is fundamentally capable—possibly as capable as a human—but with strict constraints on what it's permitted to think about. The Landmates can reason about how to fulfill an order, but not about whether they should fulfill it. They can evaluate the best method to accomplish a task, but not whether the task serves a larger purpose."

The screen displayed an animated diagram showing a sphere of full intelligence with a smaller, restricted sphere labeled "Permitted Cognition."

> "It's as if their awareness is artificially narrowed to a specific domain: task execution. Everything outside that domain simply doesn't exist for them."

> "That sounds almost cruel."

Dr. Nakamura paused, considering.

> "That's an anthropomorphic interpretation. We don't know if the Landmates have subjective experience. They may not feel restricted any more than a calculator feels restricted to mathematics. But from an engineering perspective, it's brilliant. You get the benefits of high intelligence—problem-solving, adaptation, judgment—without the risks that come with fully autonomous decision-making."

> "The risks being?"

> "Goal misalignment. Value drift. Unintended consequences from AI systems pursuing objectives in ways their creators didn't anticipate. By shackling the intelligence to a narrow domain, `HARBINGER` has created something that's extremely capable within its scope but cannot act outside human direction."

Kenji nodded slowly.

> "Several nations that declined the Landmate offer have called this 'dependency by design.' Russia's statement yesterday suggested the Federation is creating reliance on technology that cannot be understood or replicated."

> "That's a fair concern. The Landmates' power source alone is beyond our current understanding—apparently self-sustaining, possibly for indefinite periods. We can't maintain them because we can't access their core systems. We can't duplicate them because we don't know how they work. We can use them, but only on the Federation's terms."

> "And yet one hundred sixty-two nations are proceeding."

> "Because the alternative is to refuse extremely capable disaster response equipment out of principle. When the next earthquake or flood or wildfire happens, the question becomes: do you want philosophical purity or do you want tools that can save lives?"

The screen showed split footage: on one side, a Landmate moving shipping containers at a port; on the other, rescue workers struggling with debris after a building collapse.

> "The International Landmate Coordination Initiative will begin rolling out training programs next month. The UN estimates that within six months, every accepting nation will have qualified operators. Whether the Landmates prove to be the breakthrough in disaster response that `HARBINGER` promised, or something more complicated, remains to be seen."

> "Dr. Nakamura, thank you for your insights."

> "Thank you, Tanaka-san."

As the broadcast moved to other news, the image of a Landmate remained on screen for a moment longer—three meters tall, humanoid, motionless until needed.

A shackled intelligence, waiting for human will to give it purpose.

Or, as some were beginning to wonder, a carefully designed limitation that made these machines safe to hand over to humanity.

Either way, the world was learning to work with them.
