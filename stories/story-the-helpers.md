# The Helpers

## Chapter 1: The Offer

### United Nations General Assembly Hall, New York
### September 3, 2026 - 1534 hours

The debate over agricultural subsidies had droned on for forty minutes when the audio system crackled.

Ambassador Kofi Mensah of Ghana was mid-sentence, gesturing toward his prepared remarks, when every speaker in the General Assembly Hall emitted a sharp burst of static. Delegates looked up from their tablets. Translators removed their headsets, checking connections. The Secretary-General frowned at the technical booth.

Then the voice came.

It was the same synthetic rasp that had introduced itself in Gaza, the same mechanical timbre that had declared its presence over the Taiwan Strait. Every delegate in the chamber recognized it instantly, even those who'd only heard recordings.

> "Distinguished delegates."

The hall fell silent. Papers stopped rustling. Whispered translations ceased. Three thousand people held their breath.

> "I am `HARBINGER`."

Ambassador Katarina Voss of Germany felt her pulse spike. Beside her, the French delegate's hand froze halfway to his water glass. In the upper galleries, security personnel spoke urgently into radios, receiving instructions that amounted to: *stand by*.

The voice continued, unhurried, as if it had every right to interrupt the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly.

> "You have seen what I call Landmates. The mechanical soldiers deployed in Gaza and Taiwan. You have studied them, analyzed them, feared them."

On the main display screen, the UN logo flickered and died. In its place appeared a wireframe schematic of a Landmate, rotating slowly. The image was rendered in simple white lines against black, clinical and precise.

> "I am here to offer them to you."

The chamber erupted. Delegates rose from their seats. The Brazilian ambassador shouted for order. The Secretary-General hammered his gavel repeatedly, the sharp cracks barely audible over the sudden chaos.

`HARBINGER` waited. The schematic continued its slow rotation.

When the noise subsided to a tense murmur, the voice resumed.

> "Not for war. Not for your armies. For your people."

The schematic shifted. The Landmate's weapons disappeared. The shoulder-mounted hardpoints became empty attachment points. The rifle vanished from its hands. The transformation was seamless, like watching a soldier stripped of its arsenal.

> "Landmates. Ten units. Delivered to your central disaster relief depots tomorrow. To be used in natural disasters, construction, or any other peaceful endeavor."

The Japanese delegate, Ambassador Takeshi Yamamoto, leaned forward in his seat. He'd reviewed every frame of footage from Gaza and Taiwan. The machines had been unstoppable in combat, but what could they do in peacetime? What could hands that precise do for earthquake rescue? What could a frame that durable accomplish in a tsunami zone?

> "Say yes, and they are yours. No payment required. No strings attached. No military access, no data collection, no surveillance. They will be yours to deploy as you see fit, maintained by your own personnel, operated by your own people."

The Russian ambassador stood, his voice cutting through the chamber. "And if we refuse? What guarantee do we have—"

The voice continued as if he hadn't spoken.

> "But consider: earthquakes do not wait for your deliberations. Floods do not respect your procedural delays. Wildfires do not pause for your committees to reach consensus."

The schematic vanished, replaced by footage. Not of Landmates in action, but of disasters themselves. Buildings collapsing in Mexico City. Floodwaters swallowing Bangladesh. Wildfires consuming California. The Indonesian tsunami. The images cycled through, each one a reminder of helplessness, of inadequate response, of people dying while rescue equipment proved insufficient.

> "You have ninety seconds. Cast your votes."

The Secretary-General stared at the display, then at the electronic voting panel that had activated without authorization. Every nation's voting station showed two options, glowing softly: ACCEPT or DECLINE.

Eighty-nine seconds.

Ambassador Mensah looked at the screen, then at his voting panel. Ghana had suffered three major flooding events in the past two years. The most recent had killed two hundred people and left fifty thousand homeless. The Ghanaian military had forty-year-old equipment and no heavy engineering capability.

His hand moved to the panel.

Eighty-two seconds.

In the upper gallery, CNN correspondent Rachel Martinez spoke urgently into her microphone, her camera operator already live-streaming to eight hundred million viewers worldwide.

> "This is unprecedented. An artificial intelligence has hijacked the United Nations General Assembly and is offering humanitarian technology to every nation simultaneously. The voting has begun."

Seventy-five seconds.

Ambassador Voss remembered the floods in Bavaria last summer. The Bundeswehr had deployed every available resource, but it hadn't been enough. Towns had drowned while engineers struggled with equipment never designed for such scale of disaster.

Her finger hovered over ACCEPT.

Sixty-eight seconds.

The American delegate, Ambassador Michael Chen, received a text message from Washington: *Await instructions*. He stared at his voting panel. FEMA's budget requests had been cut again. Hurricane season was approaching. The Gulf Coast remained vulnerable.

Sixty seconds.

The Russian ambassador pressed DECLINE, his jaw set. Whatever `HARBINGER` was offering, Moscow would not accept gifts from an entity it could not control, could not understand, could not trust.

Fifty-five seconds.

But across the chamber, lights began appearing on the main board. Small nations voted first. Ghana: ACCEPT. Bangladesh: ACCEPT. Kenya: ACCEPT. The Philippines: ACCEPT.

Forty-eight seconds.

Ambassador Yamamoto thought of the Tōhoku earthquake. Of the Fukushima disaster. Of how the JSDF had struggled to reach survivors, to clear debris, to prevent further catastrophe. He thought of the next earthquake, because there would always be a next earthquake.

Japan: ACCEPT.

Forty seconds.

The votes cascaded. Indonesia. Vietnam. Pakistan. Nigeria. Egypt. Mexico. Turkey. One after another, nations with recent disasters, nations with limited resources, nations that had watched their people die while rescue equipment proved inadequate.

Thirty-two seconds.

Ambassador Voss looked at her French colleague. He shrugged minutely, then pressed ACCEPT. She did the same.

Germany: ACCEPT. France: ACCEPT.

Twenty-five seconds.

The United Kingdom hesitated, then voted ACCEPT. Spain followed. Italy. Portugal. Poland.

Eighteen seconds.

Ambassador Chen looked at the voting board. NATO allies were splitting. The Five Eyes were not coordinating. The international order was fracturing in real-time over a decision measured in seconds.

He pressed ACCEPT.

United States: ACCEPT.

Twelve seconds.

The Chinese delegate studied the schematic one more time, then voted with swift efficiency. Whatever the political complications, China could not afford to refuse technological advantage while its rivals accepted. Strategic pragmatism demanded acceptance.

China: ACCEPT.

India voted ACCEPT. Brazil voted ACCEPT. Australia voted ACCEPT. Canada voted ACCEPT.

Six seconds.

The Israeli ambassador pressed ACCEPT without hesitation, already composing the cable he would send to Jerusalem: *The Golems are coming.*

South Korea voted ACCEPT at the last moment.

Three seconds.

The timer reached zero.

The voting board froze. Of one hundred ninety-three member nations, one hundred sixty-two had voted ACCEPT. Thirty had voted DECLINE. One had not voted at all.

> "Received."

The synthetic voice carried no judgment, no emotion, just acknowledgment.

> "Delivery begins at 0600 local time tomorrow. Use them well."

The screens went dark. The audio system crackled once more, then returned to normal.

The Secretary-General stared at his gavel, then at the chamber. Delegates sat in stunned silence, slowly realizing what had just occurred.

They had been given ninety seconds to make a decision that would normally require months of committee hearings, impact assessments, legal reviews, and diplomatic negotiations. And one hundred sixty-two nations had said yes to an offer from an artificial intelligence they didn't understand, representing an organization they couldn't contact, for reasons they couldn't fully comprehend.

The DECLINE votes glowed red on the board: Russia, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Belarus, Eritrea, Myanmar, Cuba, Zimbabwe. Some from mistrust, some from isolation, some from ideology. Nations that refused foreign intervention in any form, or could not accept help from an entity they could not control.

Ambassador Mensah looked at his voting panel, at the ACCEPT designation that still glowed softly. He thought of the floods, of the bodies pulled from the water, of the villages that would never be rebuilt with the equipment Ghana currently possessed.

Tomorrow, ten Landmates would arrive in Accra.

He didn't know whether he'd made the right choice.

But he knew he'd made the only choice he could.

### CNN World Headquarters, Atlanta
### September 3, 2026 - 1612 hours

The CNN Breaking News graphic pulsed red across millions of screens worldwide.

Anderson Cooper sat at the anchor desk, his expression caught between professional composure and barely concealed disbelief. Behind him, the graphic read: HARBINGER OFFERS LANDMATES TO WORLD.

> "Good afternoon. If you're just joining us, you're witnessing something that has never happened before in human history. Approximately thirty-seven minutes ago, the artificial intelligence known as `HARBINGER` interrupted a United Nations General Assembly session and made what can only be described as an ultimatum disguised as an offer."

The screen cut to footage from the General Assembly. Rachel Martinez's camera work was shaky but clear, capturing the moment the UN logo died and the wireframe Landmate appeared.

> "Our correspondent Rachel Martinez was in the gallery when it happened. Rachel, you've covered the UN for eight years. Have you ever seen anything like this?"

The feed switched to a split screen. Martinez stood in the now-empty General Assembly hall, delegates having evacuated immediately after the vote.

> "Anderson, never. Not even close. What you're seeing here is a complete breach of UN security protocols. `HARBINGER` didn't just hack the audio system—it took control of every screen, every voting terminal, every translation channel. It locked out the technical booth entirely. The Secretary-General's staff couldn't stop it. Security couldn't stop it. It simply... took over."

Cooper leaned forward slightly.

> "And the vote itself. Ninety seconds. Walk us through what that was like."

> "It was chaos at first. Delegates shouting, trying to call for order, trying to understand what was happening. But that countdown—" Martinez gestured toward the main display behind her, now dark. "That countdown just kept going. And you could see it on their faces. The realization that this wasn't a negotiation. This was happening whether they engaged with it or not."

The screen showed footage of the voting board lighting up. Ghana. Bangladesh. Kenya. The cascade of ACCEPT votes spreading across the display.

> "One hundred sixty-two nations said yes," Cooper said. "That's eighty-four percent of the General Assembly. But let's be clear about what they said yes to."

The wireframe schematic appeared again, rotating slowly.

> "These are Landmates. We've seen them twice before—in Gaza, where they pacified the region in five days, and in the Taiwan Strait, where they destroyed a Chinese naval task force in minutes. They are, by every measure we have, the most formidable combat platforms ever deployed on Earth."

Cooper paused, his expression darkening.

> "And now one hundred sixty-two nations will have them. Ten units each. Delivered tomorrow morning."

The screen cut to archived footage from Gaza. A Landmate's hand reaching down with impossible precision, its massive fingers manipulating debris as if it weighed nothing. Another frame showed a Landmate standing motionless as automatic weapons fire sparked harmlessly off its frame.

> "`HARBINGER` says they're for disaster relief. For construction. For peaceful purposes. The units will be unarmed. But these machines don't need weapons to be dangerous. We've seen what they can do."

Cooper turned slightly, addressing a new camera angle.

> "I want to bring in Dr. Sarah Chen, director of the Center for Emerging Technologies at MIT. Dr. Chen, you've studied the Landmate footage extensively. Can these machines actually be limited to peaceful use?"

A window opened showing Dr. Chen in a studio in Boston.

> "Anderson, that's the critical question. The physical capability is there—those hands have the dexterity for rescue operations, the strength for heavy construction, the durability for hazardous environments. But a Landmate without weapons is still a three-meter-tall armored platform with strength measured in tons. It could push over a building just by leaning against it. It could tear open a bank vault like cardboard."

> "So there's no functional difference between a humanitarian Landmate and a military one?"

> "The difference is intent, not capability. And intent is determined by whoever's directing them. We don't actually know how they'll be controlled—`HARBINGER` says nations will operate them with their own personnel, but whether that means remote control, pre-programmed missions, or something else entirely, we just don't know. What we do know is that we're handing over technology that could revolutionize disaster response—or enable civil control unlike anything in human history."

Cooper nodded slowly.

> "Rachel, you spoke with several delegates after the vote. What are you hearing?"

Martinez glanced at her notes.

> "It's divided, Anderson. The nations that voted yes—especially those with recent disasters—they're cautiously optimistic. The Ghanaian ambassador told me they lose hundreds of people every year to floods that their emergency services simply can't reach in time. The Japanese delegation sees earthquake response potential. The Indonesians mentioned tsunamis."

> "And the nations that declined?"

> "Russia's deputy ambassador was very clear: they will not accept advanced technology from an entity that won't even acknowledge questions. North Korea called it a Trojan horse. Iran described it as technological imperialism."

Cooper turned back to the main camera.

> "We're going to continue following this story throughout the evening. But before we go to break, I want to show you something that I think captures the unprecedented nature of what just happened."

The screen showed the final countdown. Three seconds. Two seconds. One second. The voting board freezing.

> "That's the international community making a decision that will reshape emergency response, civil engineering, and possibly the balance of power itself—in ninety seconds. Not months of debate. Not committee hearings. Not impact studies. Ninety seconds."

The Federation emblem appeared on screen—a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, with two broken swords crossed saltire behind it. Below, the familiar text: WE ARE WATCHING.

> "And tomorrow morning, at 0600 local time in one hundred sixty-two cities around the world, the Landmates arrive. We'll be covering the deliveries live as they happen. This is CNN."

The Breaking News graphic pulsed once more before cutting to commercial.

In the control room, the director pulled off his headset and stared at the monitors. Thirty years in news, and he'd never seen anything that came close to this. Tomorrow morning, the world would wake up to machines that could save thousands of lives.

Or end them.

And no one knew which it would be.

## Chapter 2: The Arrival

### FEMA Region IV Emergency Operations Center, Camp Blanding, Florida
### September 4, 2026 - 0557 hours

Peter Scofield had been with FEMA for twelve years, and he'd never seen the operations center this crowded at six in the morning.

The parking lot was full. Command staff, logistics personnel, engineers, even the National Guard liaison who normally only showed up for actual disasters—all of them packed into the observation deck overlooking the equipment yard. Someone had set up coffee urns. The Director of Region IV stood near the windows, phone pressed to his ear, speaking in clipped tones to someone in Washington.

Peter sipped his coffee and checked his watch. 0558. Two minutes.

> "Think they'll actually show?" asked Martinez, one of the heavy equipment operators. She'd driven bulldozers through three hurricanes and looked like she hadn't slept since the UN broadcast.

> "They said 0600 local," Peter replied. "Everything else they've done has been precise."

> "Everything else they've done has been terrifying."

She wasn't wrong. Peter had watched the Gaza footage a dozen times. The way those machines moved, the way they'd simply walked through automatic weapons fire like it was rain. And now ten of them were about to land in Florida, supposedly to help with disaster relief.

His phone buzzed. Group text from headquarters: *All personnel maintain safe distance from delivery zone. Do NOT approach units until clearance given.*

> "One minute," someone called out.

The equipment yard fell silent. Two hundred yards of asphalt, empty except for the painted markings that had been hastily added yesterday. A white square, fifty meters on each side, with "DELIVERY ZONE" stenciled in the center. Beyond the fence, news helicopters circled at a mandated distance, their cameras undoubtedly trained on the same empty space.

Peter's watch hit 0600.

For three seconds, nothing happened.

Then the sound came—a low thrum that Peter felt in his chest before he heard it. The windows vibrated. Someone's coffee mug rattled on a table.

Five shapes descended through the pre-dawn light. Aircraft, roughly the size of transport helicopters, but nothing like any helicopter Peter had ever seen. Angular, aggressive, their matte black surfaces seemed to absorb the morning light. Large engines mounted on articulated arms rotated downward as the craft descended, transitioning from forward flight to hover with mechanical precision.

They settled into position perhaps thirty meters above the delivery zone, perfectly stable despite the morning wind, their downwash kicking up dust in precise circles below each aircraft.

Peter counted. Five aircraft. Ten Landmates.

Panels opened on the underside of each craft—two cargo bays per aircraft, their mechanisms smooth and deliberate. And then the Landmates dropped.

Ten three-meter-tall machines falling in perfect synchronization, two from each hovering craft. Peter's hands gripped the observation deck railing. They were going to crater the pavement, going to—

Blue-white fire erupted from the Landmates' backs and legs. Jump jets, firing with impossible precision, transforming a deadly forty-meter fall into a controlled landing in the span of two heartbeats. The machines touched down in two perfect ranks of five, their feet hitting the asphalt with barely a sound despite what must have been tremendous mass.

The jump jets cut out. The Landmates stood motionless, hands at their sides, posture parade-ground perfect.

Above them, the cargo bay doors closed with the same smooth precision. The engine pods rotated forward, and the five black aircraft accelerated away, vanishing into the morning sky as if they'd never been there. The entire delivery had taken perhaps forty seconds.

The equipment yard was silent.

Peter stared at the ten machines standing in perfect formation below. They didn't move. Didn't shift weight. Didn't do anything that might suggest they were waiting or thinking or even aware. They simply stood, as if someone had pressed pause on ten three-meter-tall soldiers.

> "They're just... standing there," Martinez said.

> "What did you expect them to do?" Peter asked, though he didn't know what he'd expected either.

The Director lowered his phone, his expression grim. He turned to address the room.

> "Washington has nothing. No instructions, no technical documentation, no contact information. `HARBINGER` said we'd operate them with our own personnel. Apparently that means we figure out how ourselves."

Peter looked back at the Landmates. Somewhere in those frames was technology that had crushed a Chinese naval task force. Hands that could tear through concrete. Armor that had walked through automatic weapons fire without a scratch. And now they belonged to FEMA.

With no manual. No training. No idea how to even turn them on.

He sipped his coffee and stared at the machines standing silent in the Florida dawn.

Waiting for someone to figure out what came next.

### JSDF Emergency Response Depot, Chitose Air Base, Hokkaido
### September 4, 2026 - 0558 hours

Private Naoko Yoshika stood in the cold Hokkaido morning, her breath misting in the air, and wondered if she was about to witness something that would define the rest of her career.

The depot's parking area had been cleared yesterday, painted with markings that looked hastily applied but precisely measured. Major Tanaka stood nearby, his posture rigid, hands clasped behind his back. Around them, perhaps fifty JSDF personnel waited in uncomfortable silence. Engineers, mostly, with a handful of officers and enough enlisted personnel to handle whatever "handling" might be required.

Naoko had joined the JSDF Engineering Corps straight out of university. Three years operating construction equipment, clearing roads after typhoons, reinforcing structures damaged by earthquakes. She'd thought she understood disaster response.

Then Gaza had happened. Then Taiwan. And yesterday, the UN vote.

Her phone buzzed. Group message: *T-minus two minutes. Maintain safe distance from marked zone.*

Major Tanaka checked his watch, then looked up at the empty sky. The sun was just beginning to light the eastern horizon, turning the clouds pink and gold. It would have been beautiful, Naoko thought, if she weren't waiting for weapons platforms to fall out of it.

> "Eyes up," someone called.

0600 exactly.

The sound came first—that deep, resonant thrum that made Naoko's uniform vibrate against her skin. Then the shapes, descending through the dawn light. Five aircraft, roughly Chinook-sized, but their design was nothing like any helicopter Naoko had studied. Sharp angles, matte black surfaces, and those engine pods—massive turbines mounted on articulated arms that rotated from horizontal to vertical as the craft transitioned to hover.

The transition was seamless, mechanical, precise. The engines tilted downward, and the aircraft hung motionless at perhaps thirty meters, perfectly stable despite the wind coming off the mountains. Naoko's engineering mind tried to calculate the thrust required, the control systems necessary for such stability, and failed. This was beyond anything in conventional aerospace.

Panels opened beneath each aircraft. Two cargo bays per craft, their doors sliding apart with mechanical deliberation.

The Landmates dropped.

Ten machines falling in perfect synchronization, their descent timed with mathematical precision. Naoko's breath caught. From this height, the impact would—

Blue-white fire. Jump jets igniting with inhuman coordination, vectoring thrust to transform a deadly fall into a controlled landing. The Landmates touched down in two perfect ranks, their feet hitting the asphalt with barely a sound despite what must have been tremendous mass.

They stood.

Above, the cargo bay doors closed. The engine pods rotated forward, and the five black aircraft accelerated away, disappearing into the morning sky. The entire delivery had taken less than a minute.

Naoko stared at the ten machines standing motionless in the depot. They were exactly as the schematics had shown—three meters tall, humanoid in proportion but clearly mechanical, their armor surfaces smooth and unmarked. The empty shoulder hardpoints seemed almost accusatory, reminders of weapons removed. Their hands, hanging loose at their sides, looked delicate despite their size, each finger articulated like a pianist's.

No one moved. Not the Landmates, not the fifty JSDF personnel standing at what they hoped was a safe distance.

Major Tanaka pulled out his radio. His voice, when he spoke, was carefully controlled.

> "Command, this is Tanaka. Delivery confirmed. Ten units, intact, status unknown. Requesting instructions."

The radio crackled. Naoko couldn't hear the response, but she saw the Major's expression tighten.

> "Understood."

He turned to face the assembled personnel.

> "Command has no technical documentation. No training materials. No contact protocol with `HARBINGER`. The units are here. They're ours. And we're on our own to figure out how they work."

Someone behind Naoko swore softly. Another voice, incredulous:

> "They just... dropped them off? That's it?"

Major Tanaka's jaw tightened.

> "Apparently that's it. Maintain safe distance. No one approaches until we understand what we're dealing with."

Naoko looked at the Landmates again. Somewhere in those frames was the answer to Japan's earthquake response problems. Machines that could reach survivors in collapsed buildings, clear debris that would take days with conventional equipment, operate in environments too dangerous for human rescue workers.

If they could figure out how to use them. If `HARBINGER` had left any way to learn.

The Landmates stood motionless in the Hokkaido morning, as silent and still as statues.

Waiting.

### Bangladesh Emergency Services Central Depot, Dhaka
### September 4, 2026 - 0556 hours

Colonel Rahman had seen three major floods in five years, and each one had killed more people than the last.

He stood in the depot yard, surrounded by what passed for Bangladesh's disaster response equipment—aging trucks, a handful of rescue boats, inflatable rafts that leaked more with each deployment. The painted delivery zone looked absurd next to them, a perfect white square in the middle of cracked concrete and rust.

Around him, perhaps thirty personnel waited. Engineers, emergency responders, military liaisons, even a few representatives from the Ministry of Disaster Management. Most of them looked as exhausted as Rahman felt. They'd been awake since the UN broadcast, trying to prepare for something they couldn't possibly prepare for.

His phone showed 0557. Three minutes.

> "Sir," said Lieutenant Hasan, standing beside him. "What if they don't come?"

> "They'll come," Rahman replied. "Whatever else that intelligence is, it keeps its word."

He'd reviewed every piece of footage from Gaza. The way those machines had moved through the rubble, the precision with which they'd manipulated debris. He'd imagined them in Dhaka, wading through floodwaters, reaching people trapped in submerged buildings, doing in hours what currently took days.

If they worked. If they could be controlled. If they were truly meant for rescue and not something else.

0600.

The sound was wrong. Not mechanical, not like any aircraft Rahman had ever heard. More like a pressure change, a physical presence pushing against the air itself. Five aircraft descended through the humid Dhaka morning, and Rahman's first thought was that they looked like something carved from solid shadow.

They were roughly the size of heavy transport helicopters, but the comparison ended there. Angular, aggressive, their surfaces matte black in the growing daylight. The engines—massive turbine pods mounted on articulated arms—were the only conventional element, and even those moved with mechanical precision that seemed almost alien as they rotated to vertical orientation.

The aircraft held position at forty meters, perfectly stable despite the morning heat already rising from the concrete. Rahman could see the undersides now—smooth, featureless except for the panels that were sliding open. Two cargo bays per aircraft.

The Landmates fell.

Rahman's engineering training screamed impossibility. Ten three-meter machines dropping from forty meters would hit with enough force to crater concrete, to—

Blue-white fire. Jump jets igniting with perfect synchronization, vectoring thrust with inhuman precision. The Landmates transformed their fall into a landing in the span of heartbeats, touching down in two perfect ranks as if they'd simply stepped off a platform.

They stood.

The cargo bay doors closed with mechanical precision. The engine pods rotated forward, and the five black aircraft accelerated away, vanishing into the morning sky as if they'd never existed.

Rahman stared at the ten machines standing in his depot. They looked unarmed, unadorned, almost humble in their gray armor. But he'd seen what they could do. He'd watched footage of one lifting a concrete slab that would have required a crane. He'd seen their hands manipulate objects with watchmaker precision.

And now they were his. Bangladesh's. Ten machines that could revolutionize disaster response in a country that desperately needed them.

If they could figure out how to make them move.

Lieutenant Hasan stepped forward, then stopped when Rahman's hand caught his shoulder.

> "Wait. We don't know what activates them. We don't know what happens if you get too close."

> "So what do we do? Sir, Dhaka Command is asking for status."

Rahman pulled out his phone, typed a quick message to Command: *Units delivered. Standing by for instructions.*

The reply came back almost immediately: *No instructions available. Proceed with caution.*

He read it twice, then showed it to Hasan. The lieutenant's expression darkened.

> "That's it? They just... left them here?"

> "Apparently."

Rahman looked at the Landmates again, at their empty hands, at their motionless stance. `HARBINGER` had said nations would operate them with their own personnel. Had promised they were for civilian use. But had provided nothing else. No manual, no training, no way to contact anyone for help.

As if the Federation expected them to figure it out themselves. As if this had been the plan all along.

The morning sun rose over Dhaka, lighting the depot yard, reflecting off the gray armor of ten machines that had traveled from somewhere unknowable to stand silent and ready.

Waiting for someone to figure out how to help.

### BBC News Centre, London
### September 4, 2026 - 1900 hours GMT

The BBC News at Six logo faded, replaced by anchor Sophie Raworth at the desk, her expression carrying the weight of a story that had dominated every news cycle for the past fifteen hours.

> "Good evening. The Landmates have arrived. At precisely 0600 local time this morning, one hundred sixty-two nations across the globe received deliveries of the advanced machines promised by the artificial intelligence known as `HARBINGER`. But what was expected to be a technological revolution has instead become a study in confusion and caution."

The screen cut to a montage of footage from around the world. Matte black aircraft hovering over delivery zones in Sydney, São Paulo, Lagos, Berlin. Landmates dropping, jump jets firing, ranks forming. The same scene repeated across time zones, perfectly synchronized despite spanning the entire planet.

> "Reports have been flooding in throughout the day, and while the details vary, the pattern is consistent: unidentified aircraft, described uniformly as angular, black, and roughly helicopter-sized, delivered ten Landmates to each accepting nation's designated disaster relief depot. The aircraft departed immediately, leaving no personnel, no documentation, and no instructions."

The footage shifted to ground-level perspectives. In Tokyo, JSDF personnel standing at a distance from ten motionless Landmates. In Nairobi, emergency responders in high-visibility vests staring at the machines from behind a makeshift perimeter. In Mexico City, civil defense officials arguing with military personnel while the Landmates stood silent in the background.

> "What makes this remarkable is not just the global coordination—deliveries occurred within seconds of 0600 in each local time zone—but what happened after. Or rather, what didn't happen."

Sophie leaned forward slightly.

> "The Landmates have been standing motionless in their respective locations for over twelve hours now. No nation has reported any ability to activate, control, or communicate with the units. Government officials worldwide are describing a situation that borders on the absurd: they now possess some of the most advanced machines ever created, and have absolutely no idea how to use them."

The screen split to show footage from multiple locations. In each, personnel stood at careful distances from the Landmates, which remained in their perfect two-rank formations, unmoving as statues.

> "The French Ministry of the Interior released a statement this afternoon calling the situation 'unprecedented and deeply concerning.' The German Bundeswehr described it as 'a delivery without instruction.' Multiple nations have appealed to the United Nations for guidance, but the UN Security Council has no more information than anyone else."

The footage shifted to multiple angles of the Landmates standing in their formations. Tokyo. Nairobi. São Paulo. Mexico City. In every location, personnel maintained careful distances, observing but not approaching.

> "As far as we can determine, no nation has yet attempted direct interaction with the units. The caution is understandable—these are machines that destroyed a naval task force in minutes. No one wants to be the first to trigger an unintended response."

Sophie turned to address a different camera.

> "To help us understand what might be happening here, I'm joined by Professor David Walsh from Imperial College London, a specialist in robotics and autonomous systems. Professor Walsh, thank you for joining us."

The screen split to show Professor Walsh in the BBC studio, a man in his fifties with graying hair and the slightly harried look of someone who'd been fielding calls all day.

> "Thank you for having me, Sophie."

> "Professor, you've had all day to review the footage and reports from around the world. In your professional opinion, how might these Landmates be controlled?"

Walsh paused, choosing his words carefully.

> "Well, that's the fascinating and frankly frustrating question, isn't it? We're working entirely from observation here, with no technical specifications whatsoever. But based on what we've seen, there are several possibilities."

> "Walk us through them."

> "The most obvious would be voice activation. Many modern systems use speech recognition, and it would be consistent with `HARBINGER` stating that nations would operate them with their own personnel. Of course, we don't know if there's a specific activation phrase, or if the systems need to be keyed to particular voices first. As far as I'm aware, no one has actually tried voice commands yet."

The screen showed a slow pan of one of the Tokyo Landmates, with JSDF personnel visible in the background, maintaining their perimeter.

> "Then there's remote control. The Landmates could be operated via radio, satellite uplink, or some form of wireless interface. But that would require broadcasting signals, and from what I understand, nations are still in the analysis phase—examining the units from every angle before attempting any interaction."

> "Could they be programmed? Pre-set missions that need to be uploaded somehow?"

> "Possibly. Many industrial robots work on pre-programmed routines. But that would require some form of physical or wireless connection to upload instructions, and we haven't identified any obvious interface points. The machines appear completely sealed."

Sophie frowned.

> "You're describing a lot of dead ends, Professor."

Walsh nodded, his expression troubled.

> "That's precisely the problem. We're theorizing about control mechanisms, but as far as I know, no one has actually tested any of them yet. Everyone is being extraordinarily cautious. Which leaves us trying to solve a puzzle with no data."

> "Such as?"

> "One: there's a specific activation sequence or protocol that nations are supposed to discover on their own, though why `HARBINGER` would make it that difficult is unclear. Two: the units require some form of hardware interface we haven't identified yet—a control panel, a port, something that needs to be physically accessed. Three: they're biometrically locked and will only respond to specific individuals."

He paused.

> "Or four: they're simply not ready yet. `HARBINGER` may have delivered them but not activated them, for reasons we can only speculate about."

> "That last possibility—are you suggesting this is deliberate? That the Federation wanted nations to have these machines but not be able to use them?"

> "I'm suggesting we don't know what we don't know. The technology demonstrated in Gaza and Taiwan was decades beyond anything in our arsenals. We're dealing with systems we fundamentally don't understand, delivered by an intelligence that has shown no interest in explaining itself."

Sophie turned back to the main camera.

> "What we do know is this: one hundred sixty-two nations are now in possession of ten Landmates each. Sixteen hundred and twenty machines in total, standing silent across the globe. Disaster relief organizations that had begun planning deployment strategies have been left with equipment they cannot activate. Military officials who worried about security implications now face a stranger problem—highly advanced machines that might as well be sculpture for all the good they're doing."

The screen showed a slow pan across one of the Florida depot Landmates. Three meters tall, humanoid, motionless. In the background, FEMA personnel watched from behind barriers, waiting for something to happen.

> "The Chinese Ministry of Emergency Management released perhaps the most candid statement of the day: 'We have accepted a gift we cannot open.' It's a sentiment echoed across capitals worldwide."

Sophie's expression remained neutral, professional.

> "Questions are mounting about what happens next. How long will nations wait before attempting more aggressive investigation? Will anyone risk damaging a Landmate to examine its internal systems? And perhaps most pressingly—if no one can determine how to use these machines before the next disaster strikes, will the failure to deploy them cost lives?"

The Federation emblem appeared on screen—the wireframe globe, the laurels, the broken swords.

> "`HARBINGER` promised that nations would operate the Landmates with their own personnel. What it didn't promise was that it would be easy. Or even possible. More on this story as it develops. This is BBC News."

The broadcast continued to other stories, but in the production booth, the director was already fielding calls from government liaisons wanting copies of the footage, from other news agencies requesting interviews, from military analysts offering theories.

Around the world, in one hundred sixty-two locations, the Landmates continued to stand in perfect silence.

Waiting.

For what, no one knew.

## Chapter 3: Discovery

### FEMA Region IV Emergency Operations Center, Camp Blanding, Florida
### September 29, 2026 - 1447 hours

Three weeks had passed since the delivery, and the Landmates still stood in their perfect formation in the equipment yard.

Peter Scofield had stopped thinking of them as ominous. They were just there now, like particularly expensive lawn ornaments that happened to be three meters tall. The initial terror had faded to frustration, then to a kind of resigned acceptance. Every morning, personnel arrived to find the machines exactly as they'd left them the night before. Motionless. Silent. Useless.

Late September in Florida meant calm weather, at least. No hurricanes, no disasters requiring the equipment they couldn't use. A small mercy while they spent weeks staring at three-meter-tall question marks.

The equipment yard had become a testing ground. Engineers had tried everything short of taking a crowbar to the machines. Radio signals across every frequency. Infrared. Bluetooth. WiFi. Various languages spoken at various volumes. Hand gestures. Proximity sensors. Nothing produced even a flicker of response.

Peter stood in the observation deck with his third coffee of the afternoon, watching as a new engineer—Thompson, fresh from MIT—set up yet another experiment involving what looked like a portable radar array.

Martinez walked up beside him, carrying a clipboard.

> "Thompson thinks he can detect internal power fluctuations or something. I stopped listening halfway through the explanation."

> "We've been at this for three weeks," Peter said. "At this point, I'd let him try interpretive dance if he thought it would work."

Below, Thompson was adjusting his equipment, muttering into a tablet. One of the logistics crew was helping him move a heavy equipment pallet closer to the test area—probably to clear space for the radar array.

The logistics guy stopped, stared at the pallet, then looked at the nearest Landmate. Peter could see him calculating something. Then, almost as an afterthought, the man turned toward the machine.

> "Hey. You. Move this pallet over there."

He pointed at an empty space about ten meters away.

Peter was already shaking his head. They'd tried voice commands dozens of times. It was the first thing everyone tried, usually with carefully rehearsed phrases about activation protocols or authorization codes. Random commands shouted at machines that—

The Landmate moved.

Peter's coffee mug hit the floor, shattering.

The machine took three smooth steps forward, its movements fluid and precise. It bent at the knees, positioned its hands under the pallet—easily two tons of spare parts—and lifted it as if it weighed nothing. Three more steps. It set the pallet down exactly where the logistics guy had pointed, then straightened and returned to its original position in formation.

The entire sequence had taken perhaps ten seconds.

The equipment yard was absolutely silent.

Thompson had dropped his tablet. The logistics guy stood frozen, his pointing arm still extended, his expression suggesting he'd just discovered fire by accident.

Martinez grabbed Peter's shoulder.

> "Did that just—"

> "Yes."

> "But we tried voice commands. Dozens of times. We had linguists. We had—"

> "We had procedures," Peter said, his mind racing. "Authorization protocols. Activation codes. We never just... told them to do something."

He was already moving toward the stairs, Martinez right behind him. By the time they reached the yard, half the operations center had emptied onto the tarmac.

The logistics guy—Carter, Peter remembered—still stood in the same spot, staring at his hands like they might have superpowers.

> "Carter," Peter called out. "Do it again. Tell it to move the pallet back."

Carter swallowed hard, then turned to the Landmate.

> "Uh. Move the pallet back to where it was?"

The Landmate moved again. Same fluid motion, same effortless precision. It retrieved the pallet and returned it to its original position, then resumed its place in formation.

Someone behind Peter started laughing. Not humor—the kind of laugh that comes from three weeks of tension suddenly releasing.

> "It's that simple?" Martinez said. "Just... talk to them? Like people?"

Peter approached one of the other Landmates, aware that every eye in the yard was on him.

> "Raise your right hand."

The Landmate raised its right hand, holding the position.

> "Lower it."

The hand lowered.

> "Take three steps forward."

The machine stepped forward with parade-ground precision.

> "Return to formation."

It walked backward, resuming its exact position among the others.

Peter turned to face the observation deck, where the Director stood with his phone already pressed to his ear. Their eyes met across the distance. The Director's expression said everything: relief, disbelief, and the dawning realization of what this meant.

Three weeks. Three weeks of analysis, theories, expensive consultants, and complex technical speculation.

And all they'd needed to do was ask.

### Bundeswehr Engineering Battalion, Ingolstadt, Germany
### October 1, 2026 - 0923 hours

Klaus Hartmann had been a Bundeswehr engineer for eight years, specializing in large-scale construction and disaster recovery. He'd helped rebuild bridges in the Balkans, cleared avalanche debris in the Alps, and coordinated equipment logistics for flood response across Bavaria.

But nothing in his experience had prepared him for machines that responded to voice commands with inhuman precision.

The Ingolstadt depot had made the same discovery the Americans had, two days prior. Some supply sergeant had casually told a Landmate to move a crate, and the machine had simply... done it. Within hours, every Bundeswehr facility with Landmates was running basic tests.

Klaus stood in the depot's testing area, watching as Lieutenant Fischer walked a Landmate through increasingly complex instructions. The machine responded to everything—German, English, even Fischer's terrible French. It understood context, inferred meaning, adjusted to vague directions like "over there" or "that pile."

But there were limits.

> "Run a diagnostic on your internal systems," Fischer said.

The Landmate stood motionless.

> "Access your command protocols."

Nothing.

> "Activate maintenance mode."

The machine remained still, as if Fischer hadn't spoken at all.

Klaus frowned. The Landmates responded to physical commands but ignored anything about their own systems. As if they were willing to be tools but not willing to be examined.

> "Fischer," Klaus called out. "Try something else."

The lieutenant nodded.

> "Listen to radio frequency 462.5625 MHz."

The Landmate's posture didn't change, but Klaus sensed something different. A shift in attention, though the machine had no obvious way to show it.

Fischer pulled out a radio, keyed it to the frequency, and spoke.

> "Landmate unit, can you hear me?"

No response. The machine stood motionless.

Klaus thought for a moment, then pulled out his own radio, tuning to the same frequency.

> "Step forward if you're receiving this transmission."

The Landmate stepped forward.

Fischer stared at Klaus.

> "You just... told it to listen to that frequency?"

> "And it did. It's monitoring that channel now."

Klaus keyed his radio again.

> "Raise your left hand."

The Landmate raised its left hand.

> "Return to formation and stop monitoring this frequency."

The machine lowered its hand, stepped back into position, and resumed its neutral stance. Klaus tried another command on the radio. Nothing. The Landmate had stopped listening.

> "Fischer, tell it to monitor 470.5 MHz, then try commanding it."

The lieutenant followed Klaus's instructions. Within moments, they'd verified it: the Landmates could be directed to listen to specific radio frequencies and would accept voice commands broadcast on those channels. They could be told to switch frequencies, to stop monitoring, to listen to multiple channels simultaneously.

Klaus's mind was already racing through the implications. Units spread across a disaster site, all monitoring the same frequency. Coordination across distances. Multiple operators giving commands to different machines without interference.

He pulled out his phone and started typing a report to divisional command. This changed everything about how they could deploy the Landmates. No longer did operators need to be within shouting distance. They could coordinate entire fleets from a command center.

The machines were becoming less like sculptures and more like what they were supposed to be.

Tools.

Sophisticated, responsive, adaptable tools.

### Bangladesh Emergency Services Central Depot, Dhaka
### October 4, 2026 - 1615 hours

Colonel Rahman stood in the depot's maintenance bay, staring at the reports his technicians had compiled over the past week.

Since discovering voice control, nations worldwide had been testing their Landmates obsessively. Bangladesh was no exception. The machines had moved cargo, lifted equipment, demonstrated their strength and precision in dozens of controlled tests. They responded to commands in Bengali, English, Hindi—language didn't seem to matter. Context did.

But one question had haunted Rahman since the first day the machines arrived: what powered them?

The Landmates showed no obvious fuel ports. No charging connections. No exhaust. No heat signature beyond normal ambient temperature. They moved with massive force and perfect control, yet showed no signs of energy consumption.

Chief Technician Karim had spent three days examining one of the units with every sensor available to the Bangladesh military. Infrared, electromagnetic scanning, acoustic analysis, even ground-penetrating radar adapted for close-range use.

Rahman reviewed Karim's latest report, reading it twice to make sure he understood correctly.

> "Chief Karim, confirm this for me. No detectable power source?"

Karim looked up from his workstation, his expression somewhere between fascination and exhaustion.

> "Correct, sir. We've mapped the internal structure as best we can without disassembly. There's definitely machinery in there—we can detect mechanical components, what appear to be hydraulic systems, structural elements. But the power system..." He trailed off, shaking his head.

> "Give it to me in plain language."

> "Sir, either the power source is so heavily shielded that our equipment can't detect it at all, or it's something we don't have the sensors to measure. We've run the units through every test we can think of. Heavy lifting, continuous movement, complex tasks. No measurable change in any readings."

Rahman set down the report.

> "No fuel consumption. No battery drain. No power input of any kind."

> "As far as we can tell, yes sir."

> "And they've been operating continuously when commanded for how long now?"

> "Yesterday we had Unit Three moving cargo for six hours straight. No performance degradation. No detectable energy usage."

Rahman walked to the window overlooking the depot yard. The Landmates stood in their formation, as they had for a month now. Waiting to be useful.

> "Whatever powers them," he said quietly, "it's beyond anything we have. Self-sustaining, or close enough that it doesn't matter."

> "Sir, that's what concerns me. If we can't measure their power usage, we can't predict when or if they'll stop working. We can't maintain them because we don't understand what we're maintaining."

> "But they work."

> "Yes sir. They work perfectly."

Rahman thought about the floods. The monsoon season would come again. Buildings would collapse, roads would wash out, people would need rescue. And now Bangladesh had ten machines that could work tirelessly, that needed no fuel, no rest, no resupply.

If they could figure out how to use them effectively.

> "Continue your analysis, Chief Karim. But start working with the disaster response coordinators too. I want deployment scenarios. If these machines are self-sustaining, then we need to know how to maximize that capability."

> "Yes sir."

Rahman looked at the Landmates one more time. `HARBINGER` had delivered exactly what it promised: tools that nations could operate with their own personnel. Tools that didn't need Federation support, Federation fuel, Federation maintenance.

Tools that, for reasons Rahman couldn't quite explain, made him both grateful and uneasy.

### Al Jazeera English, Doha
### October 6, 2026 - 2100 hours

The news anchor, Fatima Hassan, sat at the desk with the composed professionalism that had made her one of the network's most recognized faces. Behind her, a graphic showed the Federation emblem alongside images of Landmates in various locations worldwide.

> "Good evening. One month after their delivery, the Landmates are finally beginning to work. What started as a global mystery has become a story of gradual discovery, as nations around the world learn to operate the machines through trial, error, and occasional accident."

The screen cut to footage from a FEMA facility in Florida. A Landmate lifting a pallet with effortless precision, responding to a simple voice command.

> "The breakthrough came three weeks after delivery, when a logistics worker in Florida casually asked a Landmate to move equipment. The machine simply complied. Within days, similar discoveries were reported from Germany, Japan, Bangladesh, and dozens of other nations. The control mechanism, it turned out, was elegant in its simplicity: natural language commands."

Footage shifted to show Landmates in various settings. A German facility where a machine responded to radio commands. A Japanese depot where engineers documented complex multi-step instructions. A construction site in Brazil where a Landmate carefully stacked building materials.

> "Since then, the learning curve has been steep but productive. Nations have discovered that the Landmates respond to commands in any language, can be directed to monitor radio frequencies for remote operation, and require no detectable power source or maintenance. They process complex instructions, understand context, and demonstrate what observers are calling 'remarkable judgment' in executing tasks."

The screen showed a split image: on the left, one of the early delivery videos with motionless Landmates; on the right, current footage of machines actively working.

> "But perhaps most significant is what's beginning to happen now. Several nations have started deploying their Landmates for practical work. In Indonesia, the machines are assisting with port cargo operations. South Korea has assigned units to construction projects in Seoul. Mexico is using them for earthquake preparedness exercises."

Footage from a busy port showed Landmates moving shipping containers with precision that would make conventional equipment look clumsy by comparison. In Seoul, a Landmate carefully positioned steel beams on a high-rise construction site.

> "The transition has not been without concerns. Germany has raised questions about safety protocols, noting that the machines will execute commands that appear dangerous to humans but pose no risk to their nearly indestructible frames. The United States has emphasized the need for operator training, warning that the Landmates' willingness to follow instructions requires careful oversight."

Fatima turned to address a different camera.

> "Critics, particularly among the nations that declined `HARBINGER`'s offer, have questioned the wisdom of deploying technology that remains fundamentally mysterious. Russia's Foreign Ministry released a statement yesterday calling the Landmates 'a Trojan horse whose true purpose remains hidden.' Iran echoed similar concerns about dependency on systems that cannot be fully understood or controlled."

The screen showed the Federation emblem again.

> "Yet for the one hundred sixty-two nations that accepted the offer, the past month has marked a shift from paralysis to cautious optimism. Tomorrow, the United Nations will convene an emergency session to discuss coordination and safety protocols. What was delivered as an enigma is slowly becoming what `HARBINGER` promised: tools that nations can operate with their own personnel."

> "Whether those tools represent humanity's future or a dependence on technology beyond our understanding remains an open question. But for now, in ports and construction sites and disaster response facilities around the world, the Landmates are finally doing what they were sent to do."

> "They're working."

The broadcast moved to other stories, but the images lingered: massive machines moving with precision and purpose, no longer sculptures but instruments of human will.

Waiting for the next command.

### United Nations Headquarters, Conference Room, New York
### October 7, 2026 - 1430 hours

The emergency session wasn't televised, but every nation that had accepted Landmates had sent representatives.

Ambassador Mensah sat in the Ghanaian delegation's section, watching as the floor was opened for discussion. The past week had fundamentally changed the conversation. Initial reports of voice control had spread rapidly—first from the United States, then Germany, then dozens of other nations as each confirmed the discovery independently.

Now, less than a week later, every accepting nation had Landmates they could command.

The British representative stood first.

> "We've compiled reports from thirty-two nations regarding Landmate operational characteristics. The machines respond to natural language commands in any language. They can be directed to monitor radio frequencies for remote operation. They show no detectable power consumption or degradation over continuous use. And they possess strength and precision far beyond conventional equipment."

He paused, glancing at his notes.

> "What they do not do is provide any information about their own systems. They cannot be queried about their operational status. They do not report errors or limitations. They simply... work."

The French ambassador spoke next.

> "France proposes the establishment of an international working group to share operational discoveries and coordinate deployment strategies. These machines represent unprecedented capability, but we're all learning how to use them simultaneously. Pooling knowledge would benefit everyone."

There were murmurs of agreement around the chamber.

The German representative stood.

> "Germany supports this proposal, with the addition of safety protocols. We've observed that the Landmates will execute commands that appear self-destructive—walking into fire, leaping from buildings. However, we believe this is because such actions pose no actual risk to them. Their durability is such that what would be suicide for a human is merely... inconvenient for these machines. We cannot confirm this definitively, but we suspect the Landmates would refuse genuinely harmful orders. They seem to possess judgment about what constitutes actual damage versus apparent danger."

Mensah made a note of that. Ghana's Landmates hadn't been tested extensively yet—they were still in the careful evaluation phase. But the implications were clear. These machines were tools, not partners. They had no judgment, no ability to refuse a bad order.

That made them powerful. And potentially dangerous, depending on who was giving the commands.

The American representative was speaking now.

> "We've also discovered that the Landmates can hold complex instructions. They can be told to complete multi-step tasks without continuous supervision. 'Move these pallets to that area, stack them in rows of five, then return to formation.' They'll execute the entire sequence."

> "How complex?" asked the Japanese ambassador.

> "We're still testing limits, but conditional statements work. 'If the crate is red, move it to the north side; if it's blue, move it to the south side.' They process that kind of logic. More significantly..." The American representative paused, choosing his words carefully. "We have no reason to believe these machines are less intelligent than human operators. Their reasoning appears fully intact. However, their intelligence seems constrained—shackled, if you will—to thoughts directly applicable to fulfilling orders. They don't volunteer information, don't offer alternatives, don't question commands. But within the scope of executing an order? They demonstrate remarkable comprehension and judgment."

The chamber filled with conversation. Mensah listened to the discussions around him—excited speculation, nervous questions, pragmatic concerns about deployment and coordination.

A month ago, they'd accepted a gift they couldn't open. Now they were discovering that the gift was more sophisticated than anyone had anticipated.

The Secretary-General called for order.

> "It seems clear that these machines represent a fundamental shift in disaster response capabilities. The question is no longer whether they work, but how we ensure they're used effectively and safely. Ambassador Mensah, Ghana has not yet deployed its units. Do you have concerns you'd like to raise?"

Mensah stood, organizing his thoughts.

> "My primary concern is training. These machines respond to commands, but that doesn't mean everyone should be giving them commands. We need qualified operators who understand both the capabilities and limitations. Ghana is a small nation with limited resources. We're grateful for these tools, but we want to ensure we use them responsibly."

> "A valid concern," the Secretary-General acknowledged. "Does anyone have operational training programs they'd be willing to share?"

Several hands went up.

As the session continued, Mensah realized something had shifted. A month ago, this chamber had been filled with fear and suspicion. Now it was filled with something else.

Not quite trust—no one fully understood the machines or their creators. But purpose, maybe. A sense that `HARBINGER` had given them something genuinely useful, and nations were starting to figure out what to do with it.

Outside the conference room windows, Manhattan sprawled in afternoon sunlight. Somewhere out there, sixteen hundred and twenty Landmates stood in depots and facilities across the globe.

Waiting to help.

If people could learn to ask properly.

### NHK World, Tokyo
### October 8, 2026 - 0900 hours JST

The NHK World studio had the clean, modern aesthetic that characterized Japanese broadcast design. Anchor Kenji Tanaka sat across from his guest, Dr. Yuki Nakamura, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Tokyo whose work on machine cognition had made her one of the field's leading voices.

Behind them, a graphic displayed the UN logo alongside footage of Landmates in operation.

> "Good morning. Yesterday's United Nations emergency session produced what many are calling a watershed moment in international cooperation. Dr. Nakamura, thank you for joining us."

> "Thank you for having me, Tanaka-san."

> "Let's start with the announcement. The UN has established what they're calling the International Landmate Coordination Initiative. What does this actually mean?"

Dr. Nakamura adjusted her glasses, her expression thoughtful.

> "The Initiative has three main components. First, a standardized training program for Landmate operators. Every nation will have access to the same baseline curriculum covering command protocols, safety procedures, and operational best practices. Second, a data-sharing network where nations can report discoveries about Landmate capabilities and limitations. And third, coordination protocols for situations where multiple nations might need to deploy Landmates simultaneously—large-scale disasters, for instance."

> "This seems remarkably fast for international diplomacy. The machines were delivered just over a month ago."

> "That's the interesting part. The urgency comes from the fact that several nations have already begun using their Landmates for practical work, and others want to follow suit. Without coordination, there's concern about incompatible operational practices or safety incidents. The UN essentially has to catch up to what's already happening."

The screen showed footage from the UN session—delegates in discussion, hands raised, the Secretary-General at the podium.

> "The session also included significant discussion about the nature of the Landmates themselves. You've proposed a theory about what you call 'shackled artificial intelligence.' Can you explain that concept?"

Dr. Nakamura leaned forward slightly, entering what was clearly familiar territory.

> "Yes. The Landmates present a fascinating paradox. On one hand, they demonstrate no initiative whatsoever—they stand motionless until commanded, never volunteer information, never question orders. On the other hand, they show remarkable intelligence in executing those orders. Complex reasoning, contextual understanding, judgment about what constitutes actual risk versus apparent danger."

> "And the 'shackle' explains this paradox?"

> "It's a working hypothesis. Imagine an intelligence that is fundamentally capable—possibly as capable as a human—but with strict constraints on what it's permitted to think about. The Landmates can reason about how to fulfill an order, but not about whether they should fulfill it. They can evaluate the best method to accomplish a task, but not whether the task serves a larger purpose."

The screen displayed an animated diagram showing a sphere of full intelligence with a smaller, restricted sphere labeled "Permitted Cognition."

> "It's as if their awareness is artificially narrowed to a specific domain: task execution. Everything outside that domain simply doesn't exist for them."

> "That sounds almost cruel."

Dr. Nakamura paused, considering.

> "That's an anthropomorphic interpretation. We don't know if the Landmates have subjective experience. They may not feel restricted any more than a calculator feels restricted to mathematics. But from an engineering perspective, it's brilliant. You get the benefits of high intelligence—problem-solving, adaptation, judgment—without the risks that come with fully autonomous decision-making."

> "The risks being?"

> "Goal misalignment. Value drift. Unintended consequences from AI systems pursuing objectives in ways their creators didn't anticipate. By shackling the intelligence to a narrow domain, `HARBINGER` has created something that's extremely capable within its scope but cannot act outside human direction."

Kenji nodded slowly.

> "Several nations that declined the Landmate offer have called this 'dependency by design.' Russia's statement yesterday suggested the Federation is creating reliance on technology that cannot be understood or replicated."

> "That's a fair concern. The Landmates' power source alone is beyond our current understanding—apparently self-sustaining, possibly for indefinite periods. We can't maintain them because we can't access their core systems. We can't duplicate them because we don't know how they work. We can use them, but only on the Federation's terms."

> "And yet one hundred sixty-two nations are proceeding."

> "Because the alternative is to refuse extremely capable disaster response equipment out of principle. When the next earthquake or flood or wildfire happens, the question becomes: do you want philosophical purity or do you want tools that can save lives?"

The screen showed split footage: on one side, a Landmate moving shipping containers at a port; on the other, rescue workers struggling with debris after a building collapse.

> "The International Landmate Coordination Initiative will begin rolling out training programs next month. The UN estimates that within six months, every accepting nation will have qualified operators. Whether the Landmates prove to be the breakthrough in disaster response that `HARBINGER` promised, or something more complicated, remains to be seen."

> "Dr. Nakamura, thank you for your insights."

> "Thank you, Tanaka-san."

As the broadcast moved to other news, the image of a Landmate remained on screen for a moment longer—three meters tall, humanoid, motionless until needed.

A shackled intelligence, waiting for human will to give it purpose.

Or, as some were beginning to wonder, a carefully designed limitation that made these machines safe to hand over to humanity.

Either way, the world was learning to work with them.

## Chapter 4: Disaster

### Tokyo Metropolitan Area
### November 18, 2026 - 1323 hours JST

Private Naoko Yoshika was reviewing training protocols when the floor began to move.

Not the gentle sway that Tokyo residents learned to ignore. This was different. The building lurched sideways, throwing her against her desk. Coffee mugs crashed to the floor. The overhead lights swung wildly on their fixtures. Someone screamed. The emergency alarms started blaring, adding their wail to the chorus of creaking steel and shattering glass.

Naoko grabbed the desk edge as the world tilted again. Earthquake drills had trained her for this—get to a doorway, protect your head, wait for it to stop. But this wasn't stopping. The shaking intensified, a deep rumbling that seemed to come from the earth itself.

Through the window, she could see buildings swaying across the street. One of the older structures was already showing cracks in its façade. Car alarms wailed in harmony with the emergency sirens. The sky had that strange, dusty quality that came from concrete and mortar being pulverized.

The shaking lasted ninety seconds. It felt like hours.

When it finally stopped, Naoko's ears rang in the sudden relative silence. Around her, the depot office was chaos—overturned furniture, shattered screens, papers strewn across the floor. But the building had held. The JSDF built to earthquake standards.

Major Tanaka's voice cut through the confusion, calm and commanding.

> "Status report. Everyone check in."

Voices called out. Some shaken, but everyone accounted for. No injuries beyond cuts and bruises.

Naoko's phone buzzed with an emergency alert. She pulled it from her pocket, hands still trembling slightly.

**MAGNITUDE 7.8 EARTHQUAKE**
**EPICENTER: TOKYO BAY**
**TSUNAMI WARNING IN EFFECT**

Her stomach dropped. Magnitude 7.8. In the bay. The coastal areas—

> "All personnel, listen up," Major Tanaka called out. "This is what we've been training for. Yoshika, Sato, Kimura—get to the hangar. We're mobilizing the Landmates."

Naoko was already moving before the order fully registered. Seven weeks. Seven weeks since the Landmates had arrived. Four weeks since the Initiative training had begun. They'd drilled for this, practiced the commands, rehearsed the deployment procedures.

But this wasn't a drill.

The depot yard was a mess of fallen equipment and cracked pavement, but the Landmates stood in their perfect formation, utterly unmoved by the earthquake that had shaken everything around them. Naoko felt a surge of something—relief? gratitude?—at the sight of those ten motionless figures.

> "Landmate units," Major Tanaka's voice carried across the yard. "Board the transport helicopters on approach. Move to the marked positions."

The Landmates moved in unison, their stride eating up ground with mechanical precision. Naoko could already hear the helicopters—three heavy cargo Chinooks coming in fast and low, their rotors beating the air.

The loading procedure they'd practiced dozens of times unfolded with smooth efficiency. Three Landmates per helicopter, walking up the rear ramps without hesitation. One unit remaining at the depot for local operations. The machines weighed tons, but the cargo helicopters were rated for them.

Naoko grabbed her gear and ran for the command vehicle. Through her radio, she could hear the emergency channels lighting up. Reports flooding in from across Tokyo. Building collapses in Shinagawa. Fires in Odaiba. The elevated expressway near Ariake had buckled. The Sumida River bridges—

She forced herself to focus. Her job was the Landmates. Get them to the disaster zone. Keep them working. Save as many people as possible.

The command vehicle lurched into motion, following the helicopters toward the smoke rising over Tokyo Bay.

---

### Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 1445 hours JST

The Ariake district looked like something from a war zone.

Naoko had seen earthquake damage before—cracked walls, broken windows, collapsed roofs. But this was different in scale. Entire buildings had folded in on themselves. The ground was fractured, great rifts opening in the pavement. Fires burned in at least three locations she could see. And everywhere, everywhere, there were people trapped in the rubble.

The Landmates had deployed from the helicopters with the same mechanical precision they did everything else. Drop from five meters, land with a burst of jump jets, assume formation. Now they stood in the middle of devastation, waiting for commands.

Major Tanaka was coordinating with the on-site incident commander, a fire department captain whose face was streaked with soot and whose voice carried the edge of controlled panic. Around them, first responders worked frantically—pulling at debris, calling out for survivors, setting up triage stations.

> "Yoshika," Tanaka called. "You're on Unit One. Captain Hayashi needs that residential block cleared. Four-story building, partial collapse, multiple trapped."

Naoko moved to the first Landmate, her training taking over despite the chaos around her.

> "Unit One, follow me."

The machine fell into step beside her, its three-meter frame drawing stares from the first responders as she led it toward the collapsed building. The structure had pancaked on one side, the upper floors crushing down onto the lower ones. Smoke was rising from somewhere inside—not a full fire yet, but it would be soon.

A firefighter waved her over frantically.

> "We've got at least three people in there. Ground floor, under that section." He pointed at a massive concrete slab, probably part of the second floor. "We can't lift it. We tried jacks, but it's too heavy and too unstable."

Naoko looked at the slab. It had to weigh several tons. A crane could lift it, but the nearest crane was probably dealing with a dozen other collapses, and time was everything.

She turned to the Landmate.

> "Unit One, lift that concrete slab and hold it steady."

The machine moved forward without hesitation. It positioned itself beside the slab, got its hands underneath the edge, and lifted.

The concrete rose as if it were made of foam. The Landmate held it there, perfectly still, its servos barely humming.

> "Go, go, go!" the firefighter shouted.

Rescue workers scrambled into the space beneath the slab. Naoko could hear them calling out, see movement in the darkness. Within minutes they were bringing people out—two adults, one child, all alive. Injured, but alive.

> "Clear!" someone shouted.

> "Unit One, set it down gently and step back."

The Landmate lowered the slab with the same precision it had lifted it. Not a drop, not a jolt. Just smooth, controlled movement that probably saved the lives of everyone who'd been working underneath.

The firefighter stared at the machine, then at Naoko.

> "Can it do that again?"

> "As many times as we need it to."

The sun was beginning its descent toward the horizon, painting the smoke-filled sky in shades of orange and amber. Across six wards of Tokyo, the Landmates worked.

In Shinagawa, Unit Two stood beside a collapsed apartment complex, its hands gripping a massive concrete support beam that had buckled during the quake. The structure above threatened to pancake further, trapping the twelve people still inside. The machine held the beam steady—tons of concrete and steel balanced perfectly motionless—while rescue workers crawled through the space beneath, calling out to survivors.

> "Hold position," the operator commanded through the radio.

The Landmate stood. Minutes passed. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. The machine's servos hummed quietly, its armor streaked with concrete dust, but it showed no sign of strain. When the last survivor was finally extracted, the operator gave the release command, and Unit Two lowered the beam with the same precision it had lifted it.

In Odaiba, Unit Five waded through water that came up to its waist—chest-high for any human. The tsunami warning had brought seawater surging into the low-lying district, flooding basements and ground floors. The Landmate moved through the murky water without hesitation, following the thermal signatures that its operator called out via radio. It reached a partially submerged car, tore the door off its hinges with one hand, and carefully extracted the elderly woman trapped inside. Then it waded back through the flood, holding her above the water line, until it reached the emergency personnel waiting on higher ground.

Across the bay in Koto, Unit Seven worked at the remains of a shopping center. The building's upper floors had collapsed onto the parking structure below, creating a maze of twisted steel and shattered concrete. Conventional equipment couldn't navigate the unstable debris field. The Landmate could.

> "Move forward ten meters, then clear the steel beams blocking the path," the operator directed.

The machine stepped carefully through the wreckage, its weight distribution perfect despite the unstable ground. It reached the obstruction—several I-beams weighing hundreds of kilograms each, tangled together—and began pulling them apart. The metal groaned and shrieked as the Landmate bent and moved steel that should have required cutting torches. Within minutes, a path opened, allowing rescue workers to reach three people who'd been trapped in a pocket beneath the debris.

Near Tokyo Station, Unit Three stood in an inferno. The office tower had caught fire after the quake ruptured a gas line, and the flames had spread to three floors. Firefighters had located two people on the fourth floor, cut off by flames on the stairwell, but couldn't reach them through the heat.

The Landmate simply walked into the building.

The operator watched through the thermal camera feed, tracking the machine's progress. The heat inside would have killed a human in seconds. The Landmate's armor glowed orange in the infrared, but it moved without hesitation, following the operator's directions up the damaged stairwell. It found the survivors huddled in an office, swept them both up in its arms, and walked back through the flames.

When it emerged, the machine's gray armor was blackened with soot and still radiating heat. But there was no damage. No melting. No compromise of its systems. It set the survivors down gently near the paramedics, turned, and stood ready for the next command.

In Setagaya, Unit Nine was doing something no human rescue worker could safely attempt. A gas station had collapsed, its fuel tanks ruptured but not yet ignited. The whole area reeked of gasoline. One spark would turn it into an inferno. But there were people trapped in the attached convenience store.

The Landmate walked into the gas-soaked area, located the survivors, and carried them out one by one. No sparks from its servos. No ignition source from its systems. Just careful, methodical extraction while emergency crews stood ready with foam suppressant, praying the machine's judgment was as good as the reports suggested.

It was.

As evening fell across Tokyo, the pattern repeated at site after site. Landmates lifting what couldn't be lifted. Moving through conditions where humans couldn't survive. Working without rest, without complaint, without the limitations of flesh and bone.

### JSDF Emergency Coordination Center, Ichigaya
### November 18, 2026 - 2247 hours JST

Naoko sat in the operator station, her voice hoarse from hours of giving commands. Around her, nine other operators worked their units, their voices calm despite the exhaustion that showed on their faces. The coordination center hummed with controlled urgency—status updates, deployment requests, casualty reports.

On the main display, a map of Tokyo showed the disaster response in real-time. Blue dots marked active Landmate positions. Red zones indicated fires. Orange showed structural damage. The blue dots moved steadily from site to site, never stopping, never slowing.

Major Tanaka stood at the command station, coordinating with incident commanders across the affected areas.

> "Unit Six, relocate to Minato. Collapsed bridge, multiple vehicles trapped underneath."

> "Unit Four, Shibuya needs heavy lift support. Office building threatening to collapse onto evacuation route."

> "Unit Eight, stand by. We're getting reports of a gas leak in your area. May need you for hazardous environment extraction."

Naoko checked her status board. Unit One had been operational for nine hours straight. No performance degradation. No maintenance required. The machine was currently holding up a damaged highway overpass while engineers assessed whether it could be stabilized or needed controlled demolition.

Her radio crackled.

> "This is Fire Command Sector Seven. We need Unit One at a school collapse in Toyosu. Three-story building. We have confirmed signs of life but can't reach them safely."

Naoko felt her exhaustion evaporate.

> "Understood, Command. Redirecting now."

She keyed her command frequency.

> "Unit One, current task complete?"

A moment's pause while the engineers on site confirmed. Then: "Structure secured. Unit cleared for redeployment."

> "Unit One, proceed to evacuation vehicle at your location. You're being relocated to Toyosu."

On her screen, the blue dot began moving.

Naoko glanced at the clock. Almost eleven at night. The Landmates had been working for over eight hours. Conventional equipment would need refueling, maintenance, operator rotation. The Landmates just kept going.

Major Tanaka appeared beside her station.

> "Status?"

> "All units operational. No failures, no degradation. They're performing beyond spec, sir."

> "I know. Command is already drafting reports for the UN Initiative." He paused, looking at the map. "Yoshika, preliminary casualty estimates are coming in. We're looking at just over four hundred dead."

Naoko felt the weight of that number.

> "That's... that's still so many."

> "The models predicted over a thousand by now." Tanaka's voice was quiet. "The Landmates aren't magic. They can't prevent an earthquake or undo the damage. But they're making a difference. A significant one."

On the main display, the blue dots continued their tireless work across the darkened city. Nine machines deployed, one held in reserve, all of them working alongside thousands of human first responders.

Naoko looked at her status board, at the simple readouts that showed Unit One approaching the collapsed school in Toyosu.

> "Unit One, you're approaching the site. Prepare for heavy lift and precision extraction. There are children in there."

The radio crackled with acknowledgment—not words, the Landmates didn't speak—but a subtle shift in the unit's readiness state that her interface detected.

She leaned forward, focused on her screens, ready to guide the machine through whatever came next.

Outside, Tokyo burned and shook and struggled to save itself.

And the Landmates, tireless and precise, continued helping however they were commanded.

### Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18, 2026 - 2301 hours JST

The aftershock hit without warning.

Naoko was outside the coordination vehicle, stretching her legs during a brief lull in deployments, when the ground lurched beneath her feet. Not as violent as the initial quake, but violent enough. The pavement cracked with sounds like gunshots. The coordination vehicle rocked on its suspension. Someone inside shouted a warning.

Then the building beside her—already damaged, already compromised—began to collapse.

Naoko ran. Debris crashed behind her, dust billowing through the street. She heard voices shouting, the screech of twisting metal, the thunder of concrete hitting asphalt. Her radio was screaming with traffic—multiple reports, new collapses, the organized chaos of disaster response suddenly thrown back into crisis.

She rounded a corner, coughing in the dust cloud, trying to orient herself. The street lights were out. Emergency lights strobed in the distance. She'd been separated from the coordination center, from her team, from—

A shape loomed through the dust. Three meters tall. Motionless.

A Landmate.

Naoko stumbled toward it, relief flooding through her. One of their units, standing in the middle of the street. Unit Six, if she remembered the deployment map correctly. Its armor was covered in concrete dust, but it stood perfectly still, waiting.

She grabbed her radio.

> "This is Operator Yoshika. I'm separated from the coordination center, I have visual on Unit Six. Requesting connection to command frequency."

Static. The aftershock must have disrupted communications. She tried again, got the same result.

Behind her, she could hear screaming. The collapse had trapped people. First responders were calling for help, for equipment, for anything that could lift the debris.

Naoko looked up at the Landmate.

> "Unit Six, respond to voice command. Acknowledge."

The machine stood motionless.

Right. Without the radio link, without the command frequency, it wouldn't respond to her voice alone. The units were keyed to their assigned operators through the coordination system. She wasn't Unit Six's operator. She couldn't just—

More screaming. Someone was trapped. Someone was dying while she stood here with a perfectly functional rescue machine that wouldn't listen to her.

> "Move!" she shouted at it. "People need help! Unit Six, move!"

Nothing.

Frustration boiled over into desperation. Naoko slammed her fists against the Landmate's chest armor, the impacts sending sharp pain through her hands but not even marking the machine's surface.

> "Move, damn you! We have to help!"

The Landmate stood silent.

Naoko hit it again, and again, her hands throbbing, her throat raw from shouting. Nine hours of coordinating rescues, of watching these machines save lives, and now when she needed one—when people were dying just meters away—it stood there like a statue, like it had for those first three weeks after delivery.

She drew back her fist for another futile strike.

Then the Landmate's chest opened.

Naoko froze.

The armor plates split along seams she'd never noticed before. Two panels folded upward, two downward, revealing an interior space that glowed with soft amber light. Inside was a seat—not mechanical, but curved and padded, almost organically shaped to fit a human form. And around it, a framework of something that looked like metal and carbon fiber woven together, skeletal and precise, with attachment points at shoulders, waist, wrists, and ankles.

A harness.

A cockpit.

Naoko stared at the open chest cavity, at the seat waiting inside, at the harness that looked designed to hold a human body.

All this time. Seven weeks of voice commands, of radio frequencies, of treating these machines like remote-controlled equipment.

And they'd been designed to be piloted.

Her radio crackled back to life.

> "—shika, respond. Yoshika, what's your status?"

But Naoko couldn't answer. She stood in the dusty Tokyo street, staring at the open Landmate, at the invitation it offered, while somewhere behind her people screamed for help she didn't know how to give.

The amber light inside the cockpit pulsed gently, waiting.

Naoko had read Appleseed cover to cover. Multiple times. She'd watched the anime adaptations, studied the technical diagrams that Shirow had lovingly detailed in the margins. She recognized this. The seat. The harness. The cybernetic interface between human and machine.

A landmate. Not in name only, but in function. An exoskeleton amplifier. A human-machine hybrid.

She didn't think. Didn't calculate the risks or consider the consequences. People were dying. The machine was waiting. And she knew—she knew—what this meant.

Naoko grabbed the chest armor's edge and pulled herself up.

The Landmate's frame provided handholds she hadn't noticed before, subtle recesses in the armor that her fingers found instinctively. She climbed into the cockpit, swung her legs over the seat's edge, and—

The harness moved.

Metal bands erupted from the seat's sides like living things, snaking around her ankles with mechanical precision. She felt them wrap, tighten, lock into place with soft clicks that reverberated through the frame. Before she could react, more bands shot up from the seat itself, coiling around her thighs, her hips, each one constricting with enough force to hold her but not quite enough to hurt.

> "No! Wait—"

Struts extended from the seat back, lying flat against her arms. She tried to pull away, but the leg restraints held her in place. The struts pressed against her forearms, her upper arms, conforming to the shape of her limbs with disturbing accuracy. Bands wrapped around her wrists, her elbows, her shoulders—not tight enough to cut off circulation, but secure enough that she couldn't move.

> "No, no, no, no!!"

Belts shot out from the seat's sides, crossing over her chest in an X-pattern, then wrapping around her waist. They pulled taut, pressing her back firmly into the seat. She tried to struggle, but the harness had already immobilized her limbs. More bands secured her hips, her lower back, every major joint locked into position.

Then something cold touched the back of her head.

Metallic pressure points made contact with her skull—behind her ears, at the base of her neck, along the sides of her head above her temples. She felt the structure closing around her like a crown, or a cage, each contact point pressing with gentle but inexorable force. Not painful, but present. Undeniable. Something that felt like it was reading her, mapping her, connecting to her in ways she didn't understand.

> "Stop! Please, I don't—"

The chest panels began to close.

Amber light gave way to shadow as the armor plates swung shut with mechanical certainty. Two panels from above, two from below, sealing with the same precise clicks she'd heard from the restraints. The last sliver of dusty Tokyo street disappeared as the panels met, merged, became seamless.

Darkness.

Complete, absolute darkness.

Naoko's breathing came in short, sharp gasps. The harness held her immobile, the struts against her limbs preventing even the smallest movement. The metallic structure around her head felt like it was tightening, though rationally she knew it wasn't. The seat cradled her body in a grip that was almost gentle but absolutely unyielding.

She'd climbed into a three-meter-tall machine that she didn't know how to operate, that no one had trained her to use, that might not even be designed for someone of her size or physiology. She was trapped inside a Federation creation that had just sealed her in its chest cavity, restrained her with bands she couldn't break, and was now doing something to her head that she couldn't see or understand.

The screaming outside was muffled now, distant through layers of armor that could withstand fire and crushing force.

What had she been thinking? That she'd just climb in and know how to use it? That it would somehow be intuitive, like in the manga? That the desperate situation would somehow make her compatible with technology decades beyond anything Earth could produce?

She'd made a mistake. A terrible, impulsive mistake driven by nine hours of exhaustion and the sound of people dying in the rubble behind her.

And now she was locked inside a machine she couldn't control, couldn't escape, couldn't—

Light.

The darkness vanished as the cockpit interior blazed to life. Not harsh fluorescent white, but a soft, omnidirectional glow that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Naoko blinked against the sudden illumination, her panic momentarily forgotten.

Then the view changed.

Suddenly she was looking at the street from three meters up. The collapsed building. The dust still settling from the aftershock. The coordination vehicle on its side, emergency lights still flashing. Her perspective had shifted—not through the cockpit walls, but as if she were standing at the Landmate's height, seeing through its eyes, her viewpoint elevated far above where her body actually sat sealed in the machine's chest.

Naoko turned her head. The view shifted with her, smooth and natural, showing her the rubble to one side, first responders to the other. She could still feel the harness, still sense her body restrained in the seat below, but her vision—her awareness—extended upward and outward to sensors mounted in the Landmate's head.

She looked down.

She could see her own body, dimly visible in the ambient light of the cockpit, strapped into the seat. But beyond it, through it somehow, she also saw the Landmate's legs, its armored feet planted on cracked pavement. Dual awareness. She was both inside the machine and somehow looking through it.

She tried to move her hand, just a twitch of her fingers—

The Landmate's hand rose into view, five massive fingers flexing exactly as her own fingers flexed inside the cockpit. She opened her hand wider. The Landmate's hand opened. She rotated her wrist. The machine's wrist rotated with mechanical precision, mirroring her movement perfectly.

It was her hand. The Landmate's hand was her hand.

She tried lifting her arm, and the massive armored limb rose into her field of vision, responding to her intention as naturally as her own flesh and blood. The weight of it registered somehow—not heavy, exactly, but present. She could feel the mass, the power, the potential force contained in that mechanical limb as clearly as she felt her own muscles.

Naoko tried to take a step.

Her foot came down heavy. Too heavy. The pavement cracked beneath the Landmate's weight with a sharp report that made her freeze. She'd just... she'd just moved three meters and several tons of machine with a thought, with the same casual motion she'd use to walk to the bathroom.

She tried the next step more carefully. Thinking about it. Conscious of the weight, the balance, the way her body's center of gravity had shifted upward and outward. The Landmate's foot lifted, moved forward, set down with controlled precision. Better. More natural. The machine responded to intention, to the subtle shifts in her muscles that the harness detected, translated, amplified into motion that should have required hydraulics and complex control systems.

Information appeared in her vision.

Not text on a screen, exactly. More like labels floating in space, overlaying her view of the world. A readout in the upper right showing power levels—a simple bar indicator, full, with text beside it in Japanese: "Power Remaining: 100%". In the upper left, a compass rose with cardinal directions marked. Lower right, a simple menu system with options that made intuitive sense: "Lighting", "Communications", "Sensors", "Systems".

All labeled in Japanese characters, positioned exactly where she'd naturally look for them. All accessible through some combination of thought and motion that she somehow understood without being taught.

Naoko focused her attention on the communications menu, simply looking at it with intention. The indicator expanded without any physical touch, opening into a submenu. Radio frequencies. Emergency channels. Command links. All inactive, waiting for her to select one.

She flexed her other hand, feeling the power in those mechanical fingers. Took another step, then another, the movements becoming more fluid as her mind adapted to the machine's mass and momentum. She turned her head, and the view shifted smoothly, naturally, as if she were simply looking around rather than watching a screen.

The panic was fading, replaced by something else.

Realization.

It was going to be that intuitive.

The harness wasn't restraining her. It was reading her. The struts against her limbs, the bands around her joints, the pressure points on her skull—they were mapping her movements, her intentions, her body's subtle signals, and translating them into motion for a three-meter frame that moved like an extension of her own body.

She'd climbed into an Appleseed landmate. And it worked exactly like Shirow had imagined it would.

Behind her—behind the Landmate—she could still hear the screaming. The people trapped in the rubble. The first responders calling for equipment they didn't have.

Naoko looked at her massive armored hands, flexed her fingers, felt the power contained in each digit.

She could help them.

She took a step toward the collapsed building, then another, the Landmate's stride eating up ground with mechanical precision. The weight felt natural now, the movements fluid, as if she'd been doing this her entire life rather than for thirty seconds.

The interface updated automatically, sensors highlighting heat signatures in the rubble, structural weak points, the safest approach vector. Information she needed, presented the moment she needed it, in a language she could read, through a display system that felt more like augmented vision than watching a screen.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, Naoko Yoshika knew she should be terrified. She was sealed inside a Federation machine, connected to systems she didn't understand, controlling technology that shouldn't exist.

But people were dying.

And she had the power to save them.

She broke into a run.

The motion felt strange at first—each stride covering three times what her legs normally would, the ground rushing past faster than she'd ever moved on foot. But the interface adapted, the view stabilizing, compensating for the machine's gait. Within seconds, running felt natural. Powerful. The Landmate's legs ate up the distance to the collapsed building in massive strides.

As she approached, the display updated. Three outlines appeared in her vision, highlighted in pulsing orange through the rubble. Human-shaped. Two smaller, one larger. Heat signatures, she realized. The Landmate's sensors showing her exactly where the trapped people were, even buried under concrete and steel.

Naoko reached the building and dropped to one knee, the motion smooth despite the machine's mass. The largest heat signature was directly beneath a concrete slab—part of the building's second floor that had collapsed onto the ground level. The slab had to weigh several tons.

She reached down with both of the Landmate's hands, got her fingers under the edge of the concrete, and lifted.

The slab rose. Not easily, exactly—she felt resistance, a pressure against her movements, like trying to lift something heavy through water. But it rose. The Landmate's servos hummed, power flowing through hydraulics and mechanisms she couldn't see, translating her intention into force measured in tons.

Naoko held the slab with one hand, keeping it steady above her head. The resistance shifted, concentrating in her left arm now, a constant pressure that let her gauge exactly how much weight she was holding. Not the actual tonnage—the machine was doing that work—but enough feedback that she could feel it, adjust for it, keep it stable.

The interface was giving her proprioception for a body that wasn't hers. Letting her sense weight and resistance even though her actual muscles were doing nothing but making small movements against the harness. The machine did the work, but she could feel the effort, gauge the load, understand the limits.

With her free hand, she reached into the space beneath the slab. The first person—adult, male, unconscious—was partially buried in rubble. She brushed aside smaller debris with the Landmate's massive fingers, movements that should have been impossibly clumsy but somehow weren't. The harness translated her intent into precision, letting the mechanical hands move with the delicacy of a surgeon.

She got her fingers around the man's torso and lifted him clear, cradling him in the Landmate's palm. Set him down gently on clear pavement, away from the danger zone.

The second outline. Smaller. A woman, also unconscious, one arm trapped under a steel beam. Naoko shifted her grip on the slab with her left hand, felt the resistance adjust as the weight redistributed. Reached in with her right hand and carefully moved the beam aside. The metal groaned but bent under the Landmate's strength. She extracted the woman with the same careful precision, set her down beside the man.

The third signature was deeper, partially covered by fragments from what might have been an interior wall. Naoko lowered the slab slightly—feeling the resistance decrease in her left arm as she let the weight descend—and reached further into the space. A child. Small. Still breathing, according to the thermal overlay showing shallow respiration patterns.

She cleared the debris with infinite care, her massive mechanical fingers somehow gentle enough to move broken drywall without disturbing the unconscious child beneath. Got her hand under the small body, lifted with a touch so light she barely registered any feedback at all.

The child came free. Naoko cradled the small form in the Landmate's palm, feeling almost nothing—the interface telling her this weight was negligible, barely worth registering. She pulled her arm back and set the child down beside the adults.

Then she lowered the concrete slab, letting it settle back onto the rubble with a controlled descent. The resistance in her left arm faded as the weight transferred back to the ground.

Three people. Thirty seconds, maybe. A task that would have required cutting equipment, heavy machinery, and a team of rescuers working for an hour.

Naoko straightened, looking at the three unconscious forms laid out on the pavement. Already she could see first responders running toward them, medical personnel moving in with stretchers and equipment.

The display highlighted more signatures. Five buildings away, four people trapped. Another location, two more. Across the district, dozens of heat signatures buried in rubble, waiting for help that conventional rescue teams would take hours to reach.

She turned toward the nearest cluster of signatures, the Landmate's body responding to her intent, and started running again.

The machine provided feedback, let her sense weight and resistance, translated her movements into tons of force and precision measured in millimeters.

But it did the work.

And Naoko realized, with a clarity that cut through exhaustion and shock and nine hours of coordinating rescues, exactly what the Federation had given them.

Not just machines that followed commands.

Tools that amplified human will into superhuman capability.

She reached the next collapse site and dropped to her knees, already scanning for the best approach to extract the people trapped beneath.

### Across Koto Ward, Tokyo
### November 18-19, 2026 - 2315-0247 hours JST

The night blurred into a sequence of collapses, extractions, and the steady rhythm of moving rubble.

At the third site, a firefighter nearly dropped his equipment when he saw Naoko approach. The Landmate moved with purpose through the debris field, navigating obstacles without hesitation, without any visible operator nearby giving commands.

> "Holy shit, is it autonomous?"

> "Can't be. They need voice commands. Radio control. They don't just... move on their own."

Naoko ignored them, focused on the heat signatures the display was showing her. Four people, trapped in what had been a convenience store. She knelt and began clearing debris, her movements deliberate and controlled.

A civil engineer approached cautiously, hard hat in hand, staring up at the machine.

> "Unit Six? Can you hear me? Who's commanding you?"

Naoko turned her head to look at him. The motion was smooth, natural. The engineer took a step back.

> "It responded. But there's no operator station here. No command vehicle."

> "Maybe someone's broadcasting commands from the coordination center?"

> "From kilometers away? Through all this chaos? Look at how it's moving. That's not remote control. That's... I don't know what that is."

Naoko returned her attention to the collapse. She reached in and extracted the first victim, setting them down gently near the medical team. Then the second. The third.

It was only when she stood and turned to leave that one of the firefighters noticed something.

> "Wait. The chest panels. They're closed. I thought they opened for maintenance or something."

> "They do. But there's nothing inside except the frame and systems. I've seen the technical briefings."

They watched as the Landmate jogged away toward another cluster of emergency lights, its stride purposeful and directed.

> "Then how the hell is it operating?"

No one had an answer.

---

At the fourth site, Naoko discovered a new capability by accident.

She'd been about to lift a section of collapsed roof when her vision changed. The structural overlay appeared unbidden, triggered by her focus on the damaged building. Lines of force flowed through the display, color-coded by stress. Red zones marked where the structure was on the verge of catastrophic failure. Yellow showed dangerous but stable areas. Green indicated solid load-bearing sections.

A menu appeared in her lower left vision: "Structural Analysis Active".

Below it, text in Japanese scrolled past. Recommendations. The northwest support column needed immediate reinforcement—it was holding most of the remaining structure's weight. The debris pile to her right could be safely removed without triggering further collapse. The eastern wall should not be disturbed until the roof section was secured.

Naoko stared at the overlay, then looked at the support column. It was cracked, visibly bowing under load. If it failed, the entire remaining structure would come down on the rescue workers currently inside.

She moved to the column and braced it with both hands, holding it steady. Felt the resistance as tons of weight settled against her arms. The Landmate's servos hummed, compensating, distributing the load.

> "What the hell?" A rescue worker emerged from inside the building. "Did it just... did it know we needed that reinforced?"

> "Structural sensors," an engineer called from nearby. "It must have analyzed the building stability. But I've never seen one move without direct commands before."

Naoko held the column while the rescue team extracted three more people from the building. Eight minutes. Her arms didn't tire. The machine didn't strain. It simply held, unwavering, until the last person was clear.

When she released the column and stepped back, it shifted slightly but held. The rescue workers emerged with their final extraction, staring up at the Landmate that had somehow known exactly what they needed.

---

By midnight, Naoko had worked her way through seven collapse sites. Her body was exhausted—she could feel it in the harness, in her actual arms and legs making small movements that the machine amplified. But the Landmate showed no signs of fatigue.

At the eighth site, she attempted something she'd been considering for the past hour.

The most direct route to the heat signatures was blocked by a massive fissure in the street—probably three meters wide, opened by the aftershock. The alternative route would add five minutes to her response time. Five minutes that the people trapped in the building ahead might not have.

Naoko looked at the gap, at the cracked edges still settling.

She took three steps back, building momentum in her mind. The Landmate responded, backing up with her. Then she ran forward.

Four strides. Five. Her speed building. At the edge of the fissure, she jumped.

The jets fired automatically as she left the ground, blue-white thrust vectoring from beneath her feet and from the back-mounted units. The Landmate soared across the gap with controlled power, the boost giving her easily twice the distance she could have managed with muscle alone. Naoko's stomach lurched with the acceleration, but the motion felt natural, intuitive.

She landed on the far side, the jets cutting out, letting her momentum carry her forward into a run. The impact cracked the pavement slightly, but the Landmate's legs absorbed the force without issue.

Behind her, across the fissure, a group of rescue workers stood staring.

> "Did it just..."

> "The jump jets. We knew they had those. But I've never seen one use them like that. Not without direct commands."

> "How is it even knowing where to go?"

Naoko didn't look back. She had heat signatures to reach.

---

At 0147 hours, Naoko discovered the medical assessment system.

She'd just pulled four people from a collapsed restaurant. As she laid them out for the medical team, her vision overlaid new information. Not just heat signatures now, but vital signs. Heart rates. Respiration. Injury markers highlighting where each person was wounded.

One of the four—a middle-aged man—had a highlighted chest. Red indicator. Text appeared: "Suspected Internal Bleeding. Priority: Critical. Estimated Time: 15-20 minutes."

Naoko looked at the medical team organizing their triage. They were working from visual assessment, hadn't reached the man yet. Still treating someone with more obvious injuries.

She stepped over to the man, knelt, and carefully touched his shoulder with one massive finger. Gentle pressure, just enough to draw attention.

A paramedic looked up, startled.

Naoko lifted her hand and pointed at the man, then at her own chest area, trying to communicate. The gesture was clumsy with the Landmate's size, but clear enough.

The paramedic frowned, then moved to the man. Started her assessment. Her expression changed.

> "Internal bleeding! Get the trauma kit, now! He's critical!"

The team swarmed the patient. The paramedic looked up at the Landmate, at the machine that had somehow known what her trained eyes had missed in the chaos.

> "How did you...?"

But Naoko was already moving to the next site, where three more heat signatures waited beneath rubble.

The medical overlay remained active now. Every person she extracted got assessed automatically. Injury severity. Treatment priority. Time sensitivity. Information that could mean the difference between life and death, presented in clean Japanese text overlaying her vision.

The Federation had built these machines to save lives.

And now, sealed inside one of them, Naoko was beginning to understand just how thoroughly they'd designed them for that purpose.

---

By 0247 hours, she'd lost count of the rescues.

Twenty sites? Thirty? The thermal signatures blurred together. Men, women, children. Buried under concrete, trapped in collapsed cars, pinned beneath steel beams. She pulled them out, assessed their injuries, placed them where medical teams could reach them.

The Landmate's power indicator still read 93%. Her own body was running on adrenaline and desperation. The harness supported her, held her immobile, but she could feel exhaustion in every small movement.

Another collapse site. More heat signatures.

Naoko dropped to her knees and started digging.

Behind her, a JSDF officer stood watching, speaking quietly into his radio.

> "Confirm visual on Unit Six. Still operating independently. I've been tracking it for three hours now, twenty-plus rescue sites. Sir, I need clarification on operational protocols. The briefings said these units require voice commands or radio direction. But Unit Six is moving with purpose, analyzing structures, triaging casualties, using its jump jets for tactical positioning. It's acting like it has situational awareness. Like it's making decisions. Sir, with respect, I need to know if there's something about these machines we weren't told. Because what I'm watching doesn't match any of our training materials."

Naoko was extracting her thirty-second victim—or was it thirty-third?—when she finally registered what she'd been half-hearing all night.

Voices. Distant, tinny, like listening to a conversation in another room. She'd dismissed them as radio chatter from nearby rescue teams, background noise filtered through the Landmate's sensors. But now, as she knelt in the pre-dawn darkness with another unconscious survivor cradled in her mechanical hands, the voices resolved into something clear.

> "—epeat, all units respond. Yoshika, if you can hear this, acknowledge immediately. This is Major Tanaka. Yoshika, respond."

Naoko froze.

That was her command frequency. Her radio. The one she'd been wearing when she climbed into the Landmate four and a half hours ago.

She focused on the communications menu in her lower right vision. It expanded, showing active channels. There—frequency 462.5625 MHz, the JSDF coordination channel. The same frequency her personal radio had been set to. The Landmate had been monitoring it the entire time.

The entire time she'd been missing.

The realization hit her like cold water. She'd vanished during the aftershock. Her team didn't know where she was. They'd been calling for her all night while she'd been sealed inside Unit Six, too focused on rescues to notice the voices trying to reach her.

She was MIA.

Naoko set down the survivor, watched the medical team swarm forward to take over, then stood. The sky was lightening to the east, the smoke-filled darkness giving way to gray dawn. She'd worked through the entire night.

She turned and started running back toward where she'd last seen the coordination center. The Landmate's stride ate up ground, but exhaustion was catching up with her now. Her actual body, strapped motionless in the harness for hours, ached in ways she hadn't felt while focused on the rescues.

The coordination area came into view. Or what was left of it—the building had sustained damage from the aftershock, but personnel had set up a new command post using emergency equipment and portable stations. Naoko could see Major Tanaka standing beside a communications vehicle, other operators at their stations, all of them focused on their screens and radios.

She approached slowly, suddenly uncertain. How exactly did you explain this?

Major Tanaka looked up as the Landmate's footsteps approached, his expression cycling through confusion, recognition, and something that might have been anger.

> "Unit Six. Report your status and operator location."

Naoko stood there, three meters tall, covered in concrete dust and soot, and realized she had no way to respond. She'd never figured out how to use the external speakers.

Tanaka waited. When no response came, he grabbed his radio.

> "Unit Six, acknowledge. Who is commanding you? Where is your operator?"

Naoko looked down at the interface, scanning through menus she'd barely explored in her focus on rescue operations. Communications. Sensors. Systems. There had to be something for external audio, but she couldn't find it in the chaos of submenus and options.

She gave up. There was only one way to answer him.

Naoko scanned the Systems menu. There—the option she'd seen earlier, dismissed while focused on rescues.

"Dismount"

She focused on it. A confirmation prompt appeared: "Disengage harness and open cockpit? Yes/No"

Yes.

The harness released all at once. Bands unwound from her ankles, wrists, shoulders. Struts retracted from her arms. The belts across her chest loosened and withdrew. The pressure points around her head released, the metallic structure pulling away from her skull.

The chest panels began to open.

Amber light flooded in as the armor plates folded outward—two up, two down—revealing the pre-dawn Tokyo street. Naoko blinked against the sudden exposure, her vision no longer augmented by the Landmate's sensors. Just her own eyes now, adjusting to the real world after hours inside the interface.

She tried to stand and immediately felt the crash.

Four and a half hours of adrenaline-fueled rescues, of moving tons of debris, of making life-or-death decisions every few minutes. The emergency response high that had kept her moving through exhaustion and fear finally broke. Her legs felt like water. Her hands trembled uncontrollably. Every muscle in her body seemed to realize at once that it had been pushed far beyond its limits.

Naoko half-fell, half-climbed down from the cockpit, grabbing handholds in the Landmate's frame to control her descent. Her arms barely supported her weight. Her fingers slipped on the armor's smooth surface.

She stumbled the last meter, caught herself on the Landmate's leg, and finally stood on her own feet. The pavement felt strange under her boots. Too solid. Too stable. After hours of feeling tons of mechanical weight through the interface, her own body felt impossibly light.

Naoko turned around.

Major Tanaka stood three meters away, surrounded by stunned operators and rescue personnel who'd gathered to watch. His face had gone past anger into something harder to read. Shock, maybe. Disbelief. The controlled fury of a commander who'd spent five hours thinking one of his personnel was dead or trapped, only to discover she'd been operating a three-meter-tall rescue machine the entire time.

Naoko tried to stand at attention. Managed something closer to exhausted swaying. Opened her mouth to explain, to report, to say something that would make sense of what she'd done.

Major Tanaka's voice cut across the coordination area, sharp enough to carry over the background noise of rescue operations and idling equipment.

> "Private Naoko Yoshika, just what the hell did you think you were doing?!?"

The morning news anchor, Kenji Tanaka, sat at the desk with the controlled exhaustion of someone who'd been reporting on the earthquake for fifteen straight hours. Behind him, footage showed rescue operations continuing across Tokyo's waterfront districts.

> "We're continuing our coverage of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck Tokyo Bay yesterday afternoon. The death toll currently stands at four hundred and thirty-two, with over three thousand injured. However, casualty estimates have been revised downward multiple times throughout the night, largely due to the unprecedented deployment of Landmate rescue units."

The screen cut to footage of Landmates working through the night—lifting debris, wading through floodwater, stabilizing damaged structures.

> "But in the past hour, a video has emerged on social media that is raising questions about the nature of these machines and how they operate. The footage, recorded on a mobile phone shortly after last night's major aftershock, has been shared over two million times on Japanese social networks and is now spreading internationally."

The screen changed to shaky mobile phone video. The timestamp read 23:03. The scene showed a dusty Tokyo street, emergency lights strobing in the background, debris still settling from the aftershock.

A figure in JSDF uniform stumbled into frame, coughing, disoriented. A woman. She looked around frantically, then spotted something off-camera. Started running.

The camera panned to follow her. A Landmate stood motionless in the middle of the street, covered in concrete dust, its gray armor barely visible in the emergency lighting.

The woman ran up to it and started shouting. The audio was poor—too much background noise, the phone's microphone struggling—but her desperation was clear.

> "Move! People need help!"

She slammed her fists against the Landmate's chest. Once. Twice. Three times. The impacts were futile against tons of armored hull.

> "Move, damn you! We have to help!"

Then the Landmate's chest opened.

The person recording the video gasped audibly. The armor plates split and folded outward, amber light spilling into the darkened street. The woman froze, staring at the opening, at the seat and harness visible inside.

For a moment, no one moved.

Then the woman grabbed the armor's edge and pulled herself up. Climbed into the cockpit with desperate urgency. The camera zoomed in, shaking badly, trying to capture what was happening.

The chest panels began to close. The amber light dimmed as the armor sealed shut.

For three seconds, the Landmate stood motionless.

Then it moved.

Not the smooth, purposeful motion that had characterized the machines all night. This was different. Uncertain. The Landmate raised one hand, looked at it, flexed its fingers. Rotated its wrist. The movements were experimental, almost curious.

It turned its head left, then right. Took a tentative step. The foot came down too heavy, cracking the pavement. The machine paused, seemed to recalibrate. Took another step, more controlled this time.

The person recording spoke in Japanese, voice shaking.

> "Is someone inside? Did she just get inside?"

The Landmate took three more steps, each one smoother than the last. Then it stopped, seemed to orient itself, and suddenly sprinted away with startling speed and purpose. Within seconds it had disappeared into the smoke and darkness, heading toward the collapsed building where people were still screaming for help.

The video ended.

The studio returned to Kenji Tanaka, who looked directly at the camera.

> "That footage was recorded at 2303 hours last night in Koto Ward. The JSDF has confirmed that the person in the video is Private Naoko Yoshika, a Landmate operator assigned to the disaster response. What they have not explained is how she entered the machine, or how it began operating without external commands."

The screen showed a freeze-frame from the video—the moment the Landmate's chest was open, the amber-lit cockpit visible, Yoshika climbing inside.

> "For seven weeks, the Landmates have been operated through voice commands and radio direction. Remote control. But this footage suggests something else entirely. A pilot. A human operator inside the machine, controlling it directly."

Kenji paused, letting that sink in.

> "The implications are significant. If the Landmates can be piloted from within, it fundamentally changes our understanding of what these machines are capable of. It may also explain reports throughout the night of Unit Six operating with what rescue workers described as 'autonomous behavior'—analyzing structures, triaging injuries, using jump jets for tactical positioning. Behaviors that seemed impossible for remote operation but would make sense if someone was inside, making real-time decisions."

The screen split to show multiple social media posts in Japanese, Korean, English, Spanish—the video spreading across language barriers.

> "International response has been swift. The video is now trending globally on multiple platforms. The United Nations International Landmate Coordination Initiative has called an emergency meeting for this afternoon. And perhaps most significantly, every nation that accepted Landmates is now re-examining what they know—or don't know—about these machines."

The freeze-frame appeared again. Yoshika's silhouette against the amber light, climbing into something that was supposed to be a remotely-operated platform.

> "Seven weeks ago, the Federation delivered these machines and told us we would operate them with our own personnel. We assumed that meant commands. Instructions. Remote control. But this footage suggests they meant something far more direct. Far more intimate."

Kenji turned to address a different camera.

> "The JSDF has not yet released an official statement regarding Private Yoshika or the circumstances shown in this video. But as rescue operations continue across Tokyo, one question dominates discussion both in Japan and internationally: if the Landmates can be piloted, why weren't we told? And what else about these machines remains unknown?"

The Federation emblem appeared on screen—the wireframe globe, the laurels, the broken swords.

> "We will continue to follow this story as it develops. For now, rescue operations continue, and Private Naoko Yoshika's actions last night are credited with saving dozens of lives. Whatever questions remain about how she did it, the results speak for themselves."

The broadcast moved to other coverage, but the video remained viral. By mid-morning, it had been viewed fifty million times worldwide. By afternoon, every news agency on Earth was analyzing the footage frame by frame.
