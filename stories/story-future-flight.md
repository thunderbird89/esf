## Blue Sky Killbox

The coast shimmered under morning haze as Vandenberg Air Force Base came alive with jetwash and radio chatter. Concrete vibrated with the weight of purpose. NATO brass, consultants, and a smattering of civilian observers lined the open-air viewing gantries, craning necks against the Californian sun.

On the tarmac, four aircraft sat at idle. Three familiar silhouettes—F-22, Typhoon, Gripen—stood in stark contrast to the alien geometry of the *Talon*. Angular and predatory, its airframe shimmered subtly even at rest, as though deflecting more than radar. *Federation Aerospace Tactical Frame - Talon.* 

Sergeant Nathaniel Voss sat in its cockpit, visor dark, suit perfectly still. The others couldn't see the expression under his helmet—nor the way his breathing slowed before missions. Years off-world did that. You learned to conserve effort. And respect the unknown.

Above them, the Control Tower barked life into the frequency.

> “All right, airmen. The rules are simple: the three of you will team up against the Talon. You may use any tactic or weapon at your disposal to defeat the target. If you manage to land a successful hit, Control will update you on the status of the target—once you hit 10%, you will have won the engagement.”

> “Sir, what about the Talon's victory conditions?” came Colonel Kraus’s voice, clipped and efficient.

> “If the Talon can maintain a boresight lock on you for five consecutive seconds, we consider that a hit, and you're out. You are to disengage to 2500 meters, then return to the engagement, as a new combatant.”

> “So we use live ordnance and they can't?” Adams, the Raptor pilot, scoffed. “Doesn’t sound fair...”

> “You’ll be surprised, sergeant. Now get ready for takeoff!”

The skies above were cleared to 80,000 feet. No satellites, no stray aircraft. Only radar ghosts and godlike ambition.

### 10,000 Meters AGL - Training Airspace Zulu-9

The Talon broke formation first, gliding like a phantom across the upper jetstream. No contrail. Just absence. The Sword Flight tightened formation.

> "This is Sword One," Adams radioed. "We'll draw him down. Typhoon, keep altitude. Gripen, shadow me low. Let’s see what this freakshow does with layered threat vectors.”

> “Copy that,” said Lindholm, voice calm, clipped.

> “Achtung. Do not let it bracket us,” Kraus warned. “We are not hunting... it is.”

Missile locks triggered the first wave.

Two AMRAAMs surged toward the Talon from 40 klicks, their contrails slicing clean through the stratosphere.

Voss barely moved.

The Talon *drifted*—not evaded, not dodged, just reoriented—angles realigning mid-air like puzzle plates sliding into place. The warheads struck dead-on.

A bloom of light flared against the Talon’s shield envelope. The shimmer pulsed, then faded. Control spoke into the silence:

> “Talon shield integrity at 98%.”

Adams whistled into the comms. “You’ve *got* to be kidding me.”

> “Keep on him!” barked Kraus. The Typhoon peeled into a wide flanking arc, gun ports hot.

Another burst of cannon fire raked across the sky—Vulcan slugs from Adams, 27mm from the Typhoon, and the Gripen’s BK-27, all converging.

The Talon didn’t flinch.

The rounds disappeared into the translucent barrier just ahead of the fuselage, absorbed with a silent flicker. The shield pulsed again—barely.

> “Talon integrity holding at 96%.”

Voss pushed the Talon forward. Not with thrust, but intent. The HUD lit as his eyes narrowed. Boresight acquisition: Gripen.

Lindholm pulled a hard break and dove, G-forces grinding against his harness.

Too late.

> “Boresight lock, three seconds.”

> “Four seconds.”

> “Five. Gripen disengaged.”

Lindholm cursed in Swedish and spiraled out to 2500 meters.

> “Resetting. That thing’s cheating physics...”

> “Maintain spread!” Adams called. “We’ll try a cross-pattern slam. Typhoon high, I’ll go head-on.”

The Talon rose to meet them. Not aggressive. Not evasive. Just *inevitable*.

> “This is Voss,” his voice crackled for the first time. “You’re not fast enough. You’re not *weird* enough.”

The Raptor locked a Sidewinder and let it fly. At the same time, the Typhoon unloaded its IRIS-Ts from above.

Six missiles, two directions.

The Talon flicked sideways in a maneuver no aerodynamicist could explain, shield catching two on the left wing, one on the undercarriage. Another barely clipped the upper fuselage. The final two spiraled away, confused.

> “Talon shield at 91%.”

> “*Christ*,” Adams muttered.

Then Voss turned.

Raptor in his sights. Boresight engaged.

Timer ticking.

Adams dove hard. Countermeasures flared.

> “One second.”

> “Two.”

> “Three...”

The Talon *stayed* with him.

No engine whine. No afterburner flare. Just tracking perfection.

> “Four...”

> “Five. Raptor disengaged.”

Only the Typhoon remained.

> “It’s just you now, Colonel,” Voss said calmly.

> “Then let us dance,” came the reply.

The next pass would be closer. And the Talon was no longer drifting. It was *hunting*.

---

The Typhoon swept in from high altitude, vapor trails cutting through fractured cirrus. Colonel Kraus had waited—patient, silent—as his wingmen fell away. Now, alone, he executed a descending spiral, vectoring for a snap-deflection shot before the *thing* below could reacquire.

The Talon rotated mid-arc, pivoting along its yaw axis with predatory stillness. The canopy turned toward Kraus like an eye.

> “Let us dance,” Kraus had said.

The Talon obliged.

He opened with a gun burst, followed instantly by an off-boresight IRIS-T. Voss let the first rounds glance across the shield, sparks blossoming harmlessly in the sky. The missile struck near center-mass. Another shimmer, another pulse.

> “Talon shield at 88%,” came Control.

> “Shields are recharging,” added a second voice, clipped and clinical. “Rate is stable.”

Kraus dove beneath the Talon, banking into a climbing half-loop to force a turning fight—anything to keep the alien machine from locking.

It followed effortlessly, matching his vector with no perceivable thrust. No afterburn. Just gravity-defying control authority.

The crosshair on Voss’s HUD bloomed green.

> “Boresight lock initiated.”

> “One second.”

> “Two.”

Kraus juked left, fired a flare, then dumped chaff to throw off any track—reflex, habit. Useless. Voss stayed with him.

> “Three seconds.”

> “Four...”

> “*Gripen returning to airspace,*” Central cut in.

Lindholm burst into the zone from the east, streaking low. His Gripen’s Mauser cannon thundered.

Rounds impacted the Talon’s flank, a spray of kinetic metal against pure physics. The shield caught all of it—flickering, maybe—but still there.

> “Talon shield at 91%. Recharge active.”

Kraus rolled inverted, trying to use the distraction. It didn’t matter.

> “Five. Typhoon disengaged.”

> “You’re kidding me—” Lindholm’s voice hit the net.

Kraus broke away hard, banking wide as per protocol. Voss didn’t follow. He turned—casually—toward the Gripen.

Lindholm pulled back into a high yo-yo, looping to reset position.

> “You can’t just *ignore* fire,” he muttered.

> “I can,” Voss replied coolly. “I did.”

The Talon’s nose tracked again. Lock acquired.

> “One second.”

Lindholm turned into the threat this time, trying to force an overshoot.

Voss dropped lower, below the Gripen’s axis.

> “Two seconds.”

Rounds laced the sky again. The Talon didn’t dodge. It simply *endured*.

> “Three.”

> “Four.”

> “Five. Gripen disengaged.”

Silence.

The Talon climbed steadily above the battlefield, the shield shimmering faintly in its wake.

> “Control to all units,” the voice returned. “All aircraft disengaged. Talon remains undefeated. Engagement terminated.”

Even Kraus, circling beyond visual range, didn’t speak.

---

The comms crackled.

> “All units, RTB. Recovery vector 310. Maintain altitude, standard approach pattern. Good work, everyone.”

One by one, contrails curled as the four fighters banked toward Vandenberg. The Talon slid effortlessly into position on the outside of the formation, adjusting to match the others without a whisper of turbulence.

> “He even *flies* smug,” Adams muttered.

> “I heard that,” Voss replied.

> “You were supposed to. It’s not a compliment.”

> “Still took all three of you to get me to ninety-one,” Voss said, casually. “And that was with me standing still, more or less.”

> “*Standing still* while breaking physics in half,” Lindholm chimed in. “What is that thing even *made* of?”

> “Trade secret.”

> “Shield recharge was unfair,” Kraus cut in, his voice cooler than the others. “Had it not regenerated...”

> “You’d still be out,” Voss finished. “No offense, Colonel.”

> “None taken. I’ll simply request one for the Luftwaffe next quarter.”

> “Good luck getting it past procurement,” Adams said. “They still think thrust vectoring counts as ‘advanced tech.’”

> “So do we,” Lindholm said. “Don’t ruin it.”

They passed through 30,000 feet, the Pacific glinting beneath them.

The Talon, black against blue, held perfect formation. Despite its size, it made no sound across the net, no engine howl or aerodynamic shudder. It was just... *there*.

> “You really from off-world, Voss?” Lindholm asked, more curious now than combative.

> “Several deployments,” he said. “Most recently Kaldrith Prime. You wouldn’t like the weather.”

> “How’d you end up here?” Adams asked. “This demo?”

> “Orders,” Voss said. “Same as you.”

> “We’re here to *test* things, you’re here to *humiliate* them.”

> “It’s not personal,” Voss replied, evenly. “It’s just the future.”

Ahead, Vandenberg’s airfield came into view—runways like silver lines against the coast. Tower comms cleared all four for staggered descent.

> “Final approach in sequence,” said Control. “Touchdown in four.”

Voss flicked a switch, bringing the Talon’s undercarriage into landing configuration. Even that looked alien—no hydraulics, no visible joints, just shapes extruding into place with unnatural precision.

> “You ever *lose*, Voss?” Adams asked, not mockingly.

> “Sure,” Voss said. “That’s how we learn.”

> “And today?”

> “You learned.”

Formation broke. Landing gear locked.

Four jets descended. Three born of nation and budget. One born of something else entirely.

## Data Doesn't Lie

The debrief room was a muted theater of brushed steel and recycled air. Rows of NATO officers, analysts, and observers filled the amphitheater, the kind usually reserved for aerospace incident reviews or weapons trials gone wrong. But today, the mood wasn't grim—it was *measured*.

At the front, a large screen showed a frozen frame: the Talon, mid-roll, shedding cannon fire as though it were rain on glass. In the foreground, the F-22’s gun camera feed had been paused just as its rounds struck dead-center—and vanished.

The four pilots sat side by side, still in partial flight gear, facing the audience.

> “Begin playback,” a voice said.

Footage resumed. Gun cams, thermal overlays, telemetry. Vectors and time stamps crawled across the bottom of each quadrant. One by one, the Talon danced through them, untouched.

From the side door, a woman entered—black jumpsuit, Federation insignia in muted gray on her shoulder. She walked with calm precision, but it was the object in her hand that drew murmurs. A matte-black device the size of a book, no ports or buttons, softly glowing along its edges.

> “Thank you, Colonel Hargreaves,” she said as she reached the podium. “I’m Liaison Officer Mira Halden, Federation Defense Interface. This is *Ember*.”

The device blinked once, then projected a perfectly aligned overlay onto the main screen. Timelines lit up. Shots were color-coded. Shield responses were animated.

> “Ember has annotated the relevant frames,” Halden said, with no hint of boast. “As you’ll note, Sergeant Voss flew without active jamming, smart countermeasures, the ability to fire any weapons, **and** restricted him to visual and manual boresight.”

A murmur moved through the room.

Lindholm leaned forward.

> “*Restricted*,” he repeated. “It just outflew three of the most advanced fighters on Earth. *At the same time*.”

> “Yes,” Halden said simply.

One of the British analysts coughed into his hand.

> “We observed full visual tracking in 100% of engagement passes. No radar lock, no optical suppression, no datalink coordination. And it still maintained angle and energy superiority.”

> “And the shield?” asked Colonel Kraus, arms crossed.

Ember responded instead—her voice was clean, neutral, neither human nor robotic.

> “Talon shield integrity dropped to a minimum of 88%. All impacts were within operational margins. Energy redistribution fully compensated within thirty-four seconds of final hit.”

> “So it... healed,” Adams said flatly.

> “Correct,” said Ember.

Voss, silent until now, looked to the screen, watching a slowed-down overlay of his own flight.

> “It’s not just the shield,” he said. “It’s how it *moves*. The frame reacts like it’s reading ahead. Not guessing—*knowing*. The flight control isn’t analog or digital. It’s anticipatory.”

> “That isn’t in the presentation,” Halden said, a faint smile ghosting her lips. “But it’s noted.”

The Raptor pilot leaned back with a low sigh.

> “If this is the future,” Adams said, “we’re all flying bricks.”

> “The bricks still have roles,” Halden said, unbothered. “But you saw what we wanted you to see: survivability in a hostile, uncertain envelope. With rules of engagement that do not assume superiority.”

> “And if it *had* weapons?” Kraus asked.

> “That,” Halden said, “will be tomorrow’s question.”

Behind her, Ember shifted to a new overlay.

Tomorrow's scenario loaded silently.

---

The screen shifted again—mission icons populating across a simulated airspace map. A clean flight plan traced a loose figure-eight over a coastal terrain projection, rendered in high-altitude wireframe. Four points blinked into position at the route's corners.

Liaison Halden stepped aside, letting Ember zoom the display with a subtle motion of light.

> “You’ve all seen what the Talon can do,” she said. “Now it’s your turn to learn *how*.”

The room stilled.

> “All four of you have been cleared for conditional flight certification on the *Talon* airframe. The next phase is a series of tiered integration scenarios—each building on the last. Familiarization. Weapons. Multi-role combat. Off-axis maneuvering. Interceptor doctrine.”

> “All four?” Adams asked, brow raised. “You’re letting *us* fly that?”

> “Under supervision,” Halden replied. “You’ll operate Talon frames in a distributed training environment, beginning with base-level handling and systems integration. Your first exercise is a simple patrol route. No engagement. No threats. Just airframe fluency.”

> “Like flight school,” Lindholm muttered.

> “Flight school *on Mars*,” Adams shot back.

Ember projected pilot designations over the icons—*Talon-One* through *Talon-Four*—then began a slow pan along the route, highlighting altitude layers, comms relay nodes, and fuel-equivalent ranges.

> “Each of you will pilot a training-configured Talon under AI-assisted logging,” Halden continued. “The patrol will assess not only handling, but synchronization of the interface. If your neural latency doesn’t match the control lattice, you’ll know before the first turn is over.”

> “Sounds reassuring,” Kraus said dryly.

> “It’s not a warning,” Halden said. “It’s a filter. You’re not expected to fly *like* Sergeant Voss. But if you’re going to fly the Talon at all, you’ll need to think *with* it.”

Voss folded his arms, watching the map.

> “You won’t muscle this one through a turn,” he added. “You’ll feel like it’s flying *you* at first. Let it. Don’t fight.”

> “And if we *do* fight?” Adams asked.

> “You’ll lose,” Voss said. No smile.

> “Control simulators are prepped,” Ember announced. “Flight data from today’s engagement has been uploaded to your neural latency profiles. Preliminary sync in progress.”

The screen blinked again. A new line appeared at the bottom: *Training Block One – Talon Handling Familiarization – 0600 Tomorrow*.

Halden closed the interface. The projection vanished.

> “Welcome to Talon Flight,” she said. “Dismissed.”

---

The mess hall at Vandenberg wasn’t much—brushed aluminum tables, buzzing lights, and food that had been designed for calories first, texture second—but the pilots had claimed a corner booth, and someone had found real whiskey. Four glasses clinked over laminated briefing folders and black-bound manuals.

Adams leaned back, swirling amber in his glass.

> “All right,” he said, “I’ve read *a lot* of manuals in my life, but this one’s written like a *religious text*. 'Interpret intent through context and control input and take action to realize said intent.' What the hell does that even *mean*?”

> “I had to reread that section three times,” Lindholm said. “Thought it was a translation error. It wasn't.”

> “It wasn’t,” Voss confirmed, not looking up from his drink.

Kraus tapped the edge of his glass against the manual for emphasis.

> “That implies autonomous behavior. Not just automation. The frame is *deciding*.”

Voss nodded. “That’s the point.”

> “No,” Adams said, leaning forward, “the *point* of a manned aircraft is that the *pilot* decides. Otherwise you’ve just built a drone with an expensive seat.”

> “It’s not flying for you,” Voss said. “It’s flying *with* you. You give it intent, not orders. It takes that and calculates the optimal expression.”

> “Like saying ‘I need altitude’ and it climbs?” Lindholm asked.

> “More like thinking ‘I need to dominate this turn radius’ and it finds a maneuver that exists *outside* your own library,” Voss replied. “You think in terms of what you want to *achieve*. It chooses how.”

Kraus raised an eyebrow.

> “And what if it’s wrong?”

Voss met his gaze.

> “Then you weren’t clear.”

They were quiet for a moment.

Adams took a long sip.

> “So we’re teaching it to read our minds?”

> “No,” Voss said. “You’re teaching yourself to speak *clearly*. It already knows how to listen.”

> “That’s deeply comforting,” Lindholm muttered. “Tomorrow morning, I’ll have to whisper my hopes and dreams into a space jet so it doesn’t kill me by mistake.”

Voss cracked a smile.

> “Not unless your dream is pulling 14 Gs inverted.”

They laughed, the tension finally breaking. Even Kraus allowed himself a quiet chuckle.

Adams raised his glass.

> “To speaking clearly.”

> “To not dying tomorrow,” Lindholm added.

> “To the future,” Kraus said.

Voss tapped his glass to theirs.

> “And to listening.”

## Interface

The morning mist clung low to the airfield, softening the hard edges of hangars and gantries. Beyond the flight line, four new Talons sat in open paddocks, like wolves leashed at the edge of a forest—sleek, angular, inert only in appearance.

Sergeant Voss stood between them, arms folded, visor up. His suit was already sealed, HUD lenses retracted but ready. He watched as the others approached from the locker bays—three silhouettes in fresh flight suits marked with Federation interface tags and the stylized *Talon* icon beneath their national patches.

They slowed when the Talons came into view.

> “Still not used to how... *quiet* they look,” Lindholm murmured.

> “Or how sharp,” Adams added. “Like someone built a fighter out of broken glass and bad decisions.”

Kraus said nothing. His eyes moved across the leading edges, the absence of seams, the subtle iridescent shimmer that pulsed once every few seconds—barely visible unless you were looking.

The new suits carried the same feel—alien but tailored. Micro-actuated pressure seams. Non-invasive neural relay mesh. Breathable even under full seal, but heavy with potential.

> “I see you made it,” Voss said.

> “You sound disappointed,” Adams replied, trying to sound casual.

> “Just measuring expectations,” Voss said, nodding to the airframes. “They’re yours now. Don’t scratch them.”

They each approached their assigned craft. The canopies opened without visible hinges, just a quiet shift and lift, like a whisper parting the sky.

Adams climbed in first. The cockpit molded subtly around him—not claustrophobic, but personal. He hesitated, then placed his hands on the throttle and the stick.

> “Sergeant Christopher Adams, reporting for duty,” he said to nobody in particular.

Suddenly, the cockpit came alive. A soft cascade of lights arced across the canopy rim. Screens lit up with no startup sequence. He felt a low vibration beneath the seat—like a purr—and somewhere behind him, the Talon’s power plant flared to life.

Then came the voice.

> “Sergeant Adams, *welcome on board*.”

It was smooth. Genderless. Direct.

Adams blinked. “Okay. That’s new.”

Lindholm, climbing into his own bird, was watching with narrowed eyes. “Did it *talk* to you?”

> “Yeah,” Adams replied. “And I think it meant it.”

> “Mine hasn’t said anything,” Lindholm muttered, adjusting his harness.

> “Then maybe it’s waiting for you to say something worth responding to,” Voss called over, climbing into his own cockpit.

Kraus entered his frame last. He moved without hesitation, but his eyes kept darting to unfamiliar controls—until the system reconfigured to his posture and habits.

> “Colonel Erik Kraus,” he said, voice flat.

His cockpit pulsed once, then responded.

> “Colonel Kraus. Interface lock initialized.”

All four Talons sat ready now, their cockpits sealed, systems primed, and inertial dampers synced. On the ground, Federation techs and airbase personnel watched from a safe distance.

From Control, Ember’s voice entered their helmets:

> “Talon Flight, this is Command. Systems green across the board. Begin taxi to Runway One-Seven. Confirm formation takeoff. You are cleared for Training Block One: Familiarization Patrol.”

Voss grinned behind his visor.

> “Let’s see who listens best.”

---

The four Talons roared off Vandenberg’s Runway 17, staggered two-by-two, afterburners spooling with eerie restraint—no fireballs, no sonic boom, just a low-frequency thrum that you *felt* more than heard.

Voss led the formation, his bird climbing smoothly into the rising sun, banking west over the ocean. The others followed, less fluid. *Almost* tight. Almost.

Altitude: 24,000 feet. Velocity: Mach 0.8 and climbing.

> “Talon Flight, begin Exercise One,” came Ember’s calm voice. “Basic maneuvering pattern. Proceed with handling inputs at pilot discretion.”

Voss pulled ahead and rolled into a wide S-curve, dragging contrails over the coast like brushstrokes. His Talon moved like thought—clean, deliberate.

Behind him, Adams tried to mimic the arc. His roll started clean, then snapped too hard at the apex.

> “Whoa—whoa—!”

The nose dipped. The horizon twisted. His inertial dampers fought him.

The Talon caught the spin and stabilized before he could react.

> “Flight correction initiated,” the cockpit voice said, just a hair cooler this time.

> “Jesus,” Adams muttered, adjusting his grip. “It moved before I even—”

> “Because you panicked,” Voss cut in. “It saw you panicking and fixed it.”

Lindholm tried a high-G break-turn. Too sharp. His Talon over-rotated, lost vertical control, and dropped thirty meters in a lurch before arresting the descent with an engine-vectored kick.

> “Control intervention complete,” Ember noted.

> “It’s like wrestling a ghost,” Lindholm groaned. “Nothing responds the way I expect.”

> “That’s the problem,” Voss said. “You’re expecting. Guys, you’re still trying to fly it like it’s a regular jet. Don’t try to force those flaps to move through the stick, that’s how you lose control. Just *show it* that you want a corkscrew, and the Talon will do a ten-point screw every time.”

Kraus attempted a sharp snap-roll at altitude. The Talon complied—then immediately corrected his overcorrection and leveled back into formation, gently.

> “You’re over-inputting,” Voss continued. “Think about the maneuver, not the process. The Talon doesn’t *need* micromanagement. It wants your *intent*, not your technique.”

> “It feels like cheating,” Adams said, easing back on the stick. “I tell it ‘climb’, and it’s already five degrees nose up before I blink.”

> “That’s called trust,” Voss replied. “You don’t tell a bow how to curve the arrow. You just point.”

The formation reassembled, loosely. Still ragged on the edges, but no longer fighting the airframes. Each pilot was beginning to sense the rhythm. The machines weren’t reacting—they were *predicting*.

The four Talons banked as one, sunlight glinting off composite alloy.

> “You’re getting there,” Voss said.

> “Still feels like riding a tiger,” Lindholm muttered.

> “Yeah,” Adams added. “But at least the tiger hasn’t killed us. Yet.”

---

The airspace above the Pacific stretched wide and blue, textured only by thin stratus bands and the contrails curling behind four increasingly confident machines.

Their second loop of the figure-eight patrol was smoother. The overcorrections vanished. The Talons, instead of compensating, now flowed—each input more suggestion than command, each vector a quiet agreement between machine and pilot.

Adams leaned into a wide arc, this time not gripping the stick like a lifeline.

> “Okay,” he said, “that was actually *fun*.”

Lindholm followed in echelon, climbing in a slow spiral before flattening into level flight.

> “It’s responding before I move. Like it's listening to my spine, not my hands.”

Kraus remained quiet, but the crispness of his turns spoke for him.

Voss smiled behind his visor.

> “Good. Now stop looking at the airframe. Look *through* it.”

Adams was about to reply when something flickered at the edge of his HUD.

It had been there before. He was *sure* of it. But he hadn’t seen it until now.

In the lower left, a thrust output gauge pulsed in real-time—subtle, clean, dynamically adjusting to his projected intent. Just above it, a speed readout: *Mach 0.94*, annotated in a font that hadn’t been there a moment earlier. No startup, no menu. Just there.

> “Guys,” he said slowly. “Are your displays changing?”

> “Yes,” Lindholm replied, distracted. “Compass just popped in. South is marked with a pulse. Was that always...?”

> “I see it too,” Kraus said. “Fuel reserves, velocity delta, wind vector alignment. All in the periphery.”

Adams turned to check Lindholm’s position. As he looked, something else materialized—soft lines outlining the other Talon, annotations drifting into place: *TALON-3 – SGT LINDHOLM – STATUS: GREEN*. A translucent ring highlighted his distance and relative pitch.

He looked at Kraus. The same: *TALON-2 – COL KRAUS – SYNC: 97%*.

> “They’re labeled,” Adams said, almost whispering. “The *aircraft* are labeled.”

> “It’s not labels,” Voss said. “It’s awareness. You’re syncing. The Talon builds a mental model as your intent patterns stabilize. Once it trusts your bandwidth, it starts to fill in details.”

> “So it’s *teaching us* how to see?” Lindholm asked.

> “No,” Voss said. “It’s reminding you of what was already there.”

The Talons banked again, this time in unison—four silhouettes slicing against the sky in a clean, perfect arc.

The machines weren’t just flying. They were *listening*. *Teaching*. *Becoming familiar*.

And for the first time, the NATO pilots weren’t afraid of them.

They were starting to feel *at home*.

---

The Talons skimmed along the edge of the stratosphere, their patrol arcs clean and rhythmic, wings glinting in high-altitude sun.

> “Okay guys, wild idea: who wants to go to space?” Voss said suddenly.

> “Is that a joke?” Adams asked.

> “Only in the sense that you're the punch line,” Voss replied. “Now you’ll see some of what these things can *really* do. Come on!”

Before anyone could argue, his Talon angled upward sharply, nose slicing into the sky.

The others hesitated—but only for a second.

Adams cursed and pulled back. Lindholm and Kraus followed, their Talons syncing formation behind Voss’s.

The HUDs pulsed.

> *“Wing navigation override: orbital boost initiated.”*

At 62,000 feet, the air thinned. At 65,000, the whisper of atmospheric resistance dulled. At 70,000 feet, the Talons *changed*.

The transition was silent, but unmistakable.

There was no turbine whine. No afterburner roar.

There was only *acceleration*.

A pulse of white light rippled through each fuselage as the plasma drives kicked in. The inertial dampers flexed hard, compressing their suits as their frames surged upward at a rate no terrestrial aircraft could match. It wasn't just vertical—it was *departure*.

> “Oh *hell*—” Adams began, but the breath was crushed out of him by the force.

The blue below stretched thin. The sky turned violet. Then black.

Their vision narrowed. Fingers curled instinctively, even though the stick was no longer relevant. The Talon flew *itself*—with their intent trailing behind it, struggling to keep up.

Every heartbeat felt delayed. The G-suit strained. The canopy shook—not from turbulence, but from the *sheer violence* of exit velocity.

Lindholm grit his teeth.

> “Is—this—normal—?!”

> “It is now,” Voss said, calm, his voice the only steady thing in the storm of motion.

Below them, Earth receded.

The ascent wasn’t a climb. It was a *puncture*.

At 120,000 feet, atmospheric drag was irrelevant. The plasma drives dimmed to a low hum, and the black of near-space enveloped them, studded with cold starlight.

Silence.

The Talons leveled out—no contrails, no horizon, no sound. Just orbit-kissing altitude and four machines that weren’t supposed to be here.

> “Welcome to the real flight envelope,” Voss said.

No one replied.

They were still trying to breathe.

---

## The Adults’ Playground

They drifted in silence, four Talons hovering on the edge of the world.

Below, the curve of the Earth burned with blues and golds, oceans stitched to atmosphere in perfect silence. Above, the black was deeper than night. Stars hung like ancient sentinels, unblinking.

Inside their cockpits, the pilots still hadn’t fully exhaled.

Kraus flexed his gloved hands slowly, verifying sensation. Lindholm sat utterly still, save for his eyes, which darted from orbit lines to shield readouts to the soft glow of the HUD. Adams was the first to speak, voice raspy in his helmet.

> “We’re not in Kansas anymore.”

> “You barely made it out of the driveway,” Voss replied, his tone softer than usual.

He let the silence linger.

> “I brought you up here because I want you to understand what you’re really training for,” he said. “That figure-eight patrol back home? That’s a *kindergarten loop*. This—” he nodded toward the horizon, “—this is where the *adults* play.”

They didn’t speak. They didn’t need to.

Below them, the Pacific glinted like a molten coin under sunlight, and far to the north, faint auroras curled along the pole. Their Talons held perfect station with no effort—like they belonged here.

> “We’ll be back in a few days,” Voss said. “You’ll do this again. For longer. Harder. With objectives.”

> “Combat?” Lindholm asked, finally.

> “Eventually,” Voss said. “But first, movement. Pressure. Coordination. It’s different up here. You don’t have drag, lift, terrain. You only have inertia, thrust, and timing. Get any of those wrong... and no one hears you die.”

Adams exhaled through his teeth.

> “Hell of a view, though.”

> “You get used to it,” Voss said. “And then, eventually, you realize—this can be yours.”

He didn’t mean the Talon. He meant *space*.

> “The training manual doesn’t talk about this,” Kraus said, voice flat, but not unfeeling.

> “It doesn’t need to,” Voss replied. “The view does the talking.”

And for a long moment, no one spoke.

They simply looked.

---

The descent was gentle—eerie in how little it felt like reentry.

The Talons bled altitude without drag, slipping back into atmosphere like shadows returning to a body. The transition to air-breathing mode occurred automatically at 67,000 feet, marked only by a low, tactile hum through the cockpit as the turbines spun back to life. Control systems dampened the shift, feeding velocity into a high-altitude glide until Vandenberg’s coastline appeared beneath them.

They touched down just past sunset, wheels kissing the runway with barely a whisper. Four silhouettes. One formation.

By the time they’d peeled off flight suits and debriefed, the sky outside had turned purple, the last orange streaks dying over the ocean.

The mess hall buzzed like it never had.

They had a corner table again, but this time it wasn’t quiet.

> “I thought my spine was going to *implode*,” Adams said, gesturing wildly with a drink in one hand. “I’ve pulled high-G in the Raptor, I’ve done centrifuge tests at Wright-Patt, I’ve puked in VR. *None* of it even comes close.”

> “It felt like we were being *launched*,” Lindholm added. “Not climbing. Not accelerating. *Launched.* Like a round out of a gun.”

> “There was no engine noise,” Kraus said. “Just... force. I was expecting flame. Rumble. Not that *silent punch*.”

Adams laughed.

> “Yeah, and then it just *kept going.* Like, I was waiting for a stall cue, for buffeting, *something*. Instead it felt like time just... warped.”

> “That was the transition,” Voss said, seated with them but not animated like the others. More like a man watching a campfire burn. “That shift to plasma engines—it’s not just thrust. It’s a shift in how the Talon thinks about the environment. No more atmosphere. No more drag curves. Just vectors. You want up? You get *up*. Instantly.”

> “It wasn’t just up,” Lindholm said. “It was *off.* Like the Earth just let go.”

> “And the dampers still didn’t catch all of it,” Adams added, rubbing the back of his neck. “I was ready to black out.”

> “Same,” said Lindholm. “And I think mine *did* for a second.”

Kraus looked into his glass.

> “We weren’t passengers. We were just... slightly tolerated guests.”

They all laughed—harder than they usually did.

It was the kind of laughter that came not from comfort, but from awe. From brushing against something much larger than themselves and surviving to talk about it.

Voss let them have it.

They’d earned that much.

## Climbing the Ladder

The sky over Groom Lake was scrubbed clear by altitude and design. The test range sprawled out in concentric zones, bristling with remote towers, observation arrays, and reconfigurable target fields.

The four Talons sat on the apron, gleaming under morning light. Each of them now bore a slim weapons signature beneath the canopy—no hardpoints, no pylons, just internal bays that hinted at teeth behind the sleek.

From the observation deck, Ember’s voice chimed into their helmets.

> “Talon Flight, you are cleared for live-fire trials. Primary weapon today: plasma cannon. Targets will consist of mixed drone elements—static, mobile, evasive. Engagement is free-pattern. Scoring is automatic.”

> “Finally,” Adams muttered. “Something to *shoot*.”

> “Try not to hit each other,” Voss said, easing his bird into lift.

The Talons launched in sequence, climbing fast over the test grid. As they leveled off, the target field bloomed beneath them—silver drone silhouettes popping up like inverted shadows across a hundred square kilometers of Nevada nothingness.

> “Weapons hot,” said Kraus. “I’ve got a static target at eleven o’clock, sixty klicks.”

Adams locked his vision on it and felt the crosshair bloom to life.

He didn’t move his hands.

The HUD lock shifted the moment he *thought* about switching targets—glancing toward a mobile drone sweeping low across the field.

> “Whoa.”

> “Yeah?” Lindholm said, tracking one of his own.

> “It jumped,” Adams replied. “I didn’t touch the stick. I just looked.”

> “Intent tracking is real,” Voss said. “It knows what you’re thinking about. It’ll wait for certainty, but if your focus shifts... it’ll follow.”

Lindholm tested it—hard look right, then back left. Sure enough, the lock trailed his attention like a hawk’s gaze.

> “This is insane.”

> “This is *normal*,” Voss said. “You’re just new.”

Kraus fired first. A thin beam of pale blue light lanced out, silent and immediate. The target flared white, disintegrating with surgical neatness.

> “One down.”

Adams grinned, locked a drone, and pulsed the trigger.

His Talon fired in time with his intent—no delay, no confirmation needed. The plasma cannon erupted, not with noise but presence. The target vaporized in mid-arc.

> “Okay,” he breathed. “*Okay*.”

From above, Ember confirmed:

> “Scoring online. Talon-2: one kill. Talon-4: one kill. Talon-3: tracking multiple.”

Lindholm was dancing now, sweeping through the target zone like a duelist—beam after beam slicing out with precision.

> “It’s like the cannon *knows* when to shoot,” he said.

> “Because it does,” Voss replied. “You’re not firing a weapon. You’re giving permission.”

And around them, targets died like sparks.

---

They were mid-run—another sweep through fast-movers, the plasma cannons carving clean arcs through drone silhouettes—when the Talons *blinked*.

Not visually. *Contextually*.

New targets appeared on the far edge of the battlespace, far outside normal engagement range. Two red icons pulsed in the upper periphery of every HUD, tagged as inbound unknowns. A low chime followed, but the voice was calm.

> “Alert: new entities entering range. Configuration: legacy airframe. Profile: F-16. Source: U.S. Air Force Aggressor Program. Status: armed.”

Adams instinctively turned toward the icons—and as he did, the HUD obeyed.

As soon as he looked harder at the new target icon, a wireframe model of an F-16 appeared immediately in the space in front of him that would normally be occupied by his radar screen, showing the plane in detail. Besides the floating model, numbers hovered: *Range – 94.1 km*, *Relative Velocity – 812 knots*, *Angular Velocity – increasing*.

More text populated in sequence: *Armament: M61A1 Vulcan cannon. AIM-120C x2. AIM-9X x2. Combat-ready.*

> “They’re *live*?” Lindholm said, his voice sharp now.

> “Confirmed,” said Ember. “Simulation parameters have been modified.”

> “Modified by *who*?” Adams asked, though he already knew.

> “Just making it interesting,” Voss said casually. “They’re flown remote, but the sticks are held by two veterans from the 64th. Real instincts. Treat them like threats.”

Kraus had already slewed to face the incoming bandits. His HUD populated instantly—range vectors, cone projections, threat radii based on missile envelope.

> “It knows their loadout,” Kraus said flatly.

> “Knows *yours*, too,” Voss replied. “Keep it fair.”

The Talons reconfigured subtly in formation, keeping a high spread—each pilot already maneuvering with more precision than they had hours ago. There was no panic, only *curiosity*, tightly wrapped in adrenaline.

> “Targets still beyond visual range,” Lindholm said. “But I’m already tracking them like they’re here.”

> “They *are* here,” Adams said, watching the F-16 wireframe rotate as if on a pedestal. “I can see angle of attack. Energy state. Even their missile lock status—*wait*, I think one of them is painting me.”

A new ping sounded. A thin, amber circle appeared around his silhouette. Ember spoke again:

> “Talon-4: F-16 Alpha has initiated radar track. Missile lock likely in twelve seconds.”

> “Copy,” Adams said, flipping his weapons toggle. “Time to see what happens when old blood meets the new gods.”

---

> “I have Alpha,” Kraus said, a little too confidently.

He swept low, hugging the lower boundary of the target zone, his Talon angled sharp toward the incoming F-16’s predicted arc. The wireframe in his HUD shimmered in real-time—predictive overlays flashing where it would be in three seconds, five, seven.

> “Going for a forward lock. I’ll peel him off your tail, Adams.”

> “Watch yourself,” Lindholm warned. “They’ve got teeth.”

Kraus pushed it—tight S-turns, hard burn, trying to box the legacy fighter into a corner. But even old hands flew with instinct. The F-16 broke early, juked right, and fired before Kraus could finish lining up a shot.

> *"Missile launch detected."*

The HUD painted the trail. One AMRAAM, cold and fast, closing from below.

> “I see it,” Kraus said, snapping into a vertical roll. “I’ll—”

The missile struck his Talon centerline.

A bloom of kinetic force rippled against the shield—visible for half a second as a gold-pale distortion that shimmered, then collapsed into nothing. His bird didn't even budge.

But *Kraus* flinched.

> “*Scheiße—!*”

He pulled up instinctively, momentarily disoriented. Alarms were silent, but his pulse roared in his ears.

> “Talon-2, shield integrity at 97%,” Ember reported with polite detachment.

> “I’m... fine,” Kraus muttered. “Forgot I wasn’t in my Typhoon.”

> “You only get to forget that once,” Voss said. “Let it hit your *head*, next time. Might reset your confidence.”

> “Copy,” Kraus said through gritted teeth.

Adams had locked the second F-16—call sign Bravo—and was already in a rolling scissors to match its loops. But the drone pilot had years under his belt and used every inch of the sky. The Talon might’ve been faster, but old tactics still counted.

> “This guy’s good,” Adams said. “He’s trying to bait me into overshooting.”

> “Hold back. Let the Talon do the geometry,” Voss said.

Lindholm swung in from high above, trying to bracket Bravo from altitude. But the F-16 read the spacing, dumped countermeasures, and dove low—disappearing into a tight canyon of telemetry dead zones.

> “Damn it,” Lindholm muttered. “I had him.”

> “You *thought* you had him,” Voss corrected. “They’re not drones. They’re predators with leash lengths.”

The Talons chased, not like machines, but like learning minds.

The fight was no longer just simulation. It was war games with consequence.

And the veterans weren’t playing to lose.

---

Bravo banked hard, cutting low across the telemetry floor, terrain-skirting just beneath the Talons' sensor threshold. The legacy frame moved with razor instinct—flaring, juking, bleeding speed with finesse that only thousands of hours could teach.

Lindholm growled, frustrated. He’d been on this bastard twice, and both times the angle vanished before he could lock.

The Talon kept pace—but not quite enough. Not *clever* enough. Not yet.

Then instinct took over.

> “After him!” Lindholm barked while focused on the remaining F-16, more out of habit than out of consideration.

Immediately, the Talon chimed a tone in his helmet, subtle but bright, and the stick in his hand shifted—resistance softening, tension vectors bleeding off. The entire airframe reoriented beneath him like a wolf falling into stride behind a fleeing deer.

> “Following target,” Ember said.

He blinked. The HUD reframed around the Bravo F-16 in perfect chase geometry. Trajectory lines appeared, dynamic throttle sync engaged, and every twitch he gave the controls now curved naturally *around* the F-16’s movements.

He wasn’t flying anymore.

He was *hunting*.

> “Okay,” Lindholm whispered. “Okay, this... this works.”

The Talon matched Bravo’s speed within half a second. The enemy pilot jinked left—so did Lindholm. The drone tried to dump vertical—Lindholm’s bird beat it to the pivot.

For twenty seconds, it was a ballet.

Then the window opened.

The Bravo banked right—too sharp. Its envelope collapsed just slightly. Lindholm’s crosshair flashed green.

He squeezed the trigger.

A short burst from the plasma cannon lanced out, clean and invisible save for the brief flicker of residual ionization in the slipstream. The rounds struck clean—mid-spine, just above the engine housing.

The F-16 detonated in a white-orange bloom, shrapnel spinning out like glitter in vacuum.

> “Bravo down,” Ember announced.

> “Confirmed kill,” Voss said, audibly impressed. “Nice call, Talon-3.”

Lindholm grinned behind his visor.

> “Told it to follow him. It *did*.”

Adams cut in.

> “You just *asked*?”

> “Didn’t have time to think,” Lindholm said. “I just said it. It listened.”

> “The Talon *always* listens,” Voss replied. “The trick is knowing what to say.”

Above the still-settling debris field, three Talons banked into a new formation.

One F-16 remained.

The hunt continued.

---

Only one red icon remained.

F-16 Alpha broke high and west, accelerating to its limit, trying to stretch the Talons over open sky. Adams was already angling toward it, Talon-4 burning hard in pursuit.

> “I’ve got him,” Adams called, breath tight but controlled.

> “Don’t chase. *Predict*,” Voss said.

But Adams was already there.

The Talon’s HUD flared green, crosshair bracketing the F-16 cleanly—then shifting forward, past the aircraft.

Kraus, watching from above, narrowed his eyes.

The HUD projection of the F-16 flickered slightly, then *stretched*—a faint dotted arc extending ahead of the airframe like a ghost limb. Along it, small annotations appeared: *Projected Path – 3.2s, 5.7s, 7.4s*.

> “It’s drawing his movement,” Kraus muttered. “Extrapolating vector ahead of the aircraft.”

> “It’s always done that,” Voss said. “You were just too busy panicking before.”

Adams saw it now. The vector ghost wove ahead of the F-16, showing not just where the fighter was, but where it *wanted* to be. The Talon was already aligning, slotting itself along the future like it had always belonged there.

Alpha broke hard right.

Adams didn’t chase. He rolled and *shifted*—not reacting, but meeting the intercept point before the F-16 could commit.

> “He’s in the cone.”

A sharp double-pulse from the plasma cannon lanced out—this time not centered, but leading. The F-16 flew directly into it.

The impact tore through the rear stabilizers and fuel tank. Alpha went up in a muted flare, spiraling debris scattering across the desert below.

> “Target neutralized,” Ember confirmed. “All hostiles down.”

> “Nicely done, Talon-4,” Voss said, and for once, there was no edge to his voice. “Clean timing. You flew ahead of him, not behind.”

Adams let out a slow exhale.

> “I didn’t feel like I was flying,” he said. “It was like I just... *knew*.”

> “That’s how it starts,” Voss replied. “Once you stop flying the Talon and let it fly *with* you... that’s when the real fun begins.”

The sky above Groom Lake shimmered with heat and distance. Below, the wreckage of the past smoldered.

And overhead, four Talons circled like the future had already arrived.

---

The briefing was quick.

> “New directive from Central,” Ember said. “Live targets in the Pacific. Subsurface drones. Test of aquatic vector capabilities. Designation: Operation Deep Spike.”

> “Wait,” Adams cut in. “You mean *underwater* targets?”

> “Correct. Stand by for vector update.”

Four Talons banked southwest over the coast, engines trimmed for cruise. Below, the Pacific gleamed like molten steel, wind-carved and endless.

> “You didn’t say these things could *swim*,” Lindholm muttered.

> “They don’t swim,” Voss replied. “They *fly* underwater.”

> “That’s not—”

> “Don’t think about it.”

The HUDs shifted as they approached the drop zone—projected dive paths, bathymetric maps, sonar pings stitched into three dimensions. Target silhouettes pulsed beneath the surface: submersible drones, automated, hostile-coded, silent.

> “Target depth: 480 meters,” Ember intoned.

Voss dropped first, nosing his Talon directly toward the ocean. He hit the surface like a spear—no splash, no resistance.

Gone.

Lindholm hesitated. His stomach curled.

“Every instinct and every brain cell in Lindholm’s head screamed against him as he dove his Talon directly at the water.”

And then, he was underwater and *still flying*.

Pressure increased, but so did clarity. The HUD recalibrated instantly—altimeter switching to depth, velocity adjusted to fluid dynamics, sonar painting arcs ahead like radar never could. Engine output didn’t dip. If anything, it stabilized.

> “Subsurface transition complete,” Ember said smoothly. “Plasma engine reconfiguration successful.”

> “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Lindholm breathed.

The others followed, disappearing into the deep one by one. Beneath the surface, the Talons moved like sharks—sleek and fast, ignoring buoyancy, carving through water as if it were just denser air.

Weapons displays shifted—projectile systems adjusted for underwater drag, plasma cannons automatically modulated to prevent bloom-out, guidance systems switched to magnetic vectoring.

> “Talon-4, sonar ping—bearing zero-one-eight,” Adams called. “Sub-drone moving fast, low profile. Trying to mask in a thermal vent.”

Lindholm pivoted toward it, surprised at how naturally the Talon obeyed, even at depth. The control surfaces didn’t matter here. Only intent.

The drone appeared as a flicker of metal and silhouette. Kraus blinked a targeting command, and a torpedo-like plasma shot surged through the dark—no bubble trail, just a shimmer.

The drone ruptured in silence.

> “Kill confirmed,” Ember said.

Adams curved beneath a second drone, flipped belly-up, and fired into its ballast cavity.

Another flare. Another deletion.

> “This is *absurd*,” Lindholm said. “I’ve trained for five environments. None of them included *flying like a goddamn fighter jet under the sea*.”

> “Welcome to Talon doctrine,” Voss said, already diving toward a third contact. “Forget the environment. Only trust the intent.”

The ocean lit up with motion.

The hunt continued, even in the deep.

---

The ocean floor loomed ahead, a sprawling trench system etched into basalt and silt. The last two sub-drones ran silent between jagged outcroppings and the husks of old war games—mock subs, ballast tanks, sonar buoys long since gutted. A maze of rust and darkness.

The Talons ghosted through it.

Even here—amid crushing pressure and liquid density—they moved like they always had: precise, effortless. Control inputs translated as fluidly as in atmosphere. Roll, pitch, yaw—nothing changed. No sluggishness. No drift. Just intent, realized.

Adams dipped through a vertical crevice, plasma cannon armed. His HUD layered depth lines over the terrain, highlighting currents, sonar reflections, and pressure pockets where a drone might try to hide.

> “They’re threading the bottom,” he said. “Staying low, masking thermals.”

> “Doesn’t matter,” Lindholm replied. “I can *feel* where it’s going.”

Kraus peeled left, cutting between rock spires at full vector, no loss in control.

> “This is obscene,” he muttered. “We’re flying *better* down here than most aircraft fly in clean sky.”

> “That’s the point,” Voss said. “Air, space, sea—it’s all one battlespace now. You either adapt, or you’re wreckage.”

A new ping.

One drone broke cover, angling hard for a trench wall—trying to vanish into acoustic shadow.

Adams was already there.

He didn't fire at the drone. He fired *through* the space it *had* to move into.

A flicker of charged light cut the water, and the drone shredded into bubbles and debris.

> “Target down. One left.”

Lindholm surged forward, catching the final signature darting between two submerged ridgelines. He dove under it, came up inverted, and pulsed a short beam through its midsection.

It disintegrated with barely a ripple.

> “Final contact eliminated,” Ember confirmed. “All targets neutralized. Subsurface exercise complete.”

The Talons held formation at 600 meters depth, gliding in a slow arc over the seafloor.

> “I’m never going back to normal jets,” Adams said, still stunned.

> “You won’t have to,” Voss replied.

Above them, the light of the surface barely reached down.

But here, in the deep, they moved like kings.

---

The Talons cruised silently along the seafloor, the simulated warzone now quiet—just the soft churn of ocean layers above and HUDs free of hostiles.

> “That was it?” Adams asked. “Over already?”

> “Fast, clean, efficient,” Lindholm said, still adjusting to the strange weightlessness of subsurface flight. “Like everything else with this thing.”

Then the pings changed.

Low-frequency. Directional. Not from Ember. Not from the drones.

Voss's HUD updated mid-turn. A new contact. No Federation tag. No IFF beacon.

> “Stand by,” he said. “New sonar contact—deep, low signature. Looks like a prowler.”

The Talons angled toward the signal source, riding a descending thermal layer. The HUD painted a shadow ahead—long, sleek, unmistakable. Not a drone. Not a target.

A *submarine*.

Kraus zoomed in on the silhouette.

> “That’s no decoy. That’s a Jin-class.”

---

### 410 meters below – PLAN Strategic Reconnaissance Submarine *Hǎishì Yǐng*

Sonar Officer Liu’s brow furrowed as the display updated. The signature was *wrong*—not a whale, not geological noise. Too fast. Too deliberate.

> “Captain, we have multiple contacts. No acoustic match in the database. Speed... excessive for manned vessels at this depth.”

Commander Zhen approached the console, eyes narrowing. Four objects. No ping response. No IFF. One swept overhead with impossible precision, decelerating with no prop wash or cavitation trail.

> “Visuals?” he asked.

The periscope module—retracted but always ready—was deployed through a slender hull sleeve fitted for high-depth observations. A low-light external camera snapped into place.

And there they were.

Four sleek shapes. Angular, faceted, glowing faintly along their control surfaces. They moved with uncanny grace—*intelligent* grace—circling the submarine with practiced curiosity. One passed within twenty meters of the conning tower and didn’t leave so much as a pressure wake.

Not fish. Not American. Not Russian. Not anything they’d ever seen.

> “What *are* they?” Liu asked quietly.

Commander Zhen said nothing. Just watched.

---

### Back with Talon Flight

The Talons glided around the Jin-class, silent but deliberate.

> “What the hell is a Chinese sub doing here?” Adams asked. “They’re way outside patrol zones.”

> “Probably watching *us*,” Kraus replied.

> “Should we report it?” Lindholm asked.

> “Already done,” Voss said. “Central’s listening.”

The sub made no aggressive moves. It turned—slowly—back toward deeper water, as if to say *you didn’t see us, and we didn’t see you.*

And then it was gone.

The Talons didn’t pursue. They simply hovered, watching.

> “Guess we made an impression,” Adams muttered.

> “Good,” Voss replied. “Let them wonder.”

---

The Talons ascended with a grace that belied their mass, streaking upward through the weight of the Pacific with no turbulence, no drag. The transition was seamless—pressure bleeding away, water giving way to sky.

Then they broke the surface.

Spray exploded around each frame as they burst into daylight, trailing ribbons of vapor that shimmered in the afternoon sun. With a smooth jolt, their engines shifted from plasma-thrust vectoring to air-breathing mode, and just like that, they were jets again.

> “Talon Flight, you are clear for return vector,” Ember announced.

The four aircraft climbed in tight formation, banking toward the coastline. Vandenberg loomed on the horizon, a pale thread between sea and land.

> “Okay,” Adams said, breaking the silence, “so underwater combat is *officially* the weirdest thing I’ve done in a jet.”

> “Seconded,” Lindholm added. “I wasn’t sure we were going to survive that dive. The way it just *ignored* the transition...”

> “It didn’t ignore it,” Kraus said. “It *anticipated* it. We weren’t flying through water—we were executing intent through a different medium.”

> “You’ve been talking to Voss too much,” Adams muttered.

> “He’s not wrong,” Voss replied. “The Talon doesn’t care where it flies—air, sea, orbit. The laws change. The *process* doesn’t.”

> “Still doesn’t explain that sub,” Lindholm said.

A pause.

> “They were watching us,” Kraus said. “Probably thought they’d catch us testing something exotic. Joke’s on them.”

> “You think they’ll report it?” Adams asked.

> “Of course,” Voss said. “With confusion. Maybe a little fear.”

> “Good,” Lindholm said. “We could use a little mystery on our side for once.”

The coast approached, sun dipping low behind them. The Pacific shimmered beneath their wings, hiding the evidence of what had just taken place.

> “Still weird how natural it felt, though,” Adams said, quieter now. “Like the Talon always knew it would be down there.”

> “It did,” Voss replied. “We’re the ones playing catch-up.”

The formation tightened as they dropped into approach. Four aircraft. Four minds. One purpose.

They weren’t just climbing the ladder anymore.

They were building it.

---

### Aboard *Hǎishì Yǐng* – Depth 320 meters, Eastern Pacific

The hum of the Jin-class submarine’s systems filled the control room—steady, low, familiar. But the bridge crew remained tense, faces drawn, eyes flicking from consoles to the forward screens and back again.

Sonar Officer Liu studied the playback loop for the third time. No cavitation, no propulsion wake, no conventional signature of *any* kind. Just the tracks—fast, tight, purposeful—moving around them like wolves circling a penned animal.

> “They circled us like predators,” Liu said, almost in disbelief.

Captain Zhen stood with arms crossed behind the command console, his brow furrowed. For several long seconds, he said nothing.

Then:

> “They were watching,” he said. “Not intercepting. Not jamming. Just... *watching*.”

> “A threat?” Liu asked cautiously.

> “If they were really threats,” Zhen said, “I don't think we'd be having this conversation.”

The room stayed silent.

Nav Officer Fang leaned in.

> “Do we report this to Beijing as an armed encounter?”

> “No,” Zhen said immediately. “No weapons fired. No sonar lock. No challenge. This never happened.”

> “But—Captain—”

> “It *never happened,*” Zhen repeated. “We were never here. They were never there.”

The crew exchanged uneasy glances, but no one argued. Everyone aboard knew the truth of what had just occurred.

They had crossed a line—an illegal intrusion into US coastal surveillance waters under the guise of a passive environmental sweep. Had they been caught by any conventional American system, it would be a diplomatic firestorm.

But *this*?

Whatever those aircraft were—if they *were* aircraft—they weren’t part of anything in open doctrine. No markings. No known drive systems. No established countermeasures. The moment they arrived, control of the encounter was never in Chinese hands.

They were lucky to be allowed to leave.

Zhen turned to Liu again.

> “Catalog what we can. Strip metadata, sanitize logs. We’ll report a sonar anomaly—no visual contact, no confirmation.”

> “And the footage?” Liu asked.

> “Marked for internal analysis,” Zhen said. “Strictly. And if anyone asks...”

He let the thought hang.

> “We heard nothing. We saw nothing. And we certainly weren’t testing acoustics ten kilometers off the California coast.”

No one said anything more.

They didn’t have to.

---

## Sci-Fi is Real

The briefing room wasn’t much different from the others—same brushed metal walls, same embedded lighting, same rows of modular chairs. But something about the *atmosphere* had shifted.

The four pilots sat a little straighter this time. They didn’t bother hiding their curiosity. Or their skepticism.

At the front, Mira Halden stood flanked by a large wall display already alight with orbital projections—arcs and paths that extended far beyond Earth’s gravity well.

Ember hovered quietly nearby, her holographic core pulsing in slow rhythm.

> “Good morning,” Halden said. “This next block is Block Four — *Orbital and Interplanetary Combat Trials*. You will ascend to Earth orbit and perform maneuvering drills, then travel to the Moon, where you will have your first taste of space combat. Once you're victorious, you will move to Mars, then enter controlled combat scenarios within the asteroid belt.”

That drew a few raised eyebrows.

Adams frowned, crossing his arms.

> “That’s going to take a long time…”

> “Nah,” Voss said from the far end of the room, only half-looking up from a datapad. “Barely a second to the Moon. Not more than four to Mars.”

The room paused.

Kraus glanced at him like he’d misheard.

> “Four *what* to Mars?”

> “Seconds,” Voss replied, with the detached air of a man discussing weather.

Lindholm blinked.

> “You're joking.”

> “You think I’m smiling?”

Halden stepped forward, clearly used to this moment.

> “Today, you’ll also be introduced to Talon warp capability. This includes FTL vector alignment, bubble projection, and subspace braking procedures. Each frame is fitted with a short-hop spatial drive calibrated to interplanetary transit. These systems are not theoretical. They are *routine*.”

The wall screen shifted, now showing schematics of the Talon’s warp nacelles—stealthed inside the fuselage until extended during high-velocity operations. Next to them, transit paths: Earth to Luna, Luna to Mars, Mars to Belt—each labeled not in days or hours, but *seconds*.

> “You will begin in orbit,” Halden continued. “Once you’ve completed your maneuvering evaluations and weapons sync in zero-gravity conditions, Ember will authorize your transition to lunar space. All transitions are frame-locked. The system will not allow miscalculated jumps.”

> “That’s comforting,” Adams muttered.

> “You’ll thank it later,” Voss said. “Mars gets *crowded* fast.”

Lindholm rubbed the back of his neck, glancing at the trajectory map. One of the arcs pulsed—highlighted in red.

> “And the asteroid belt?”

> “Where we stop holding your hand,” Halden said, folding her arms. “No terrain. No fallback. Just vector math and intent.”

Kraus, who had said nothing, finally spoke.

> “You’re not teaching us to fly anymore,” he said quietly. “You’re teaching us to *fight in space*.”

Halden didn’t smile. She didn’t need to.

> “Correct.”

---

They lifted off from a secure pad at Vandenberg, four Talons rising into crisp morning air under conventional turbine thrust, engines spooling with a tight, modulated whine. Compared to the last time—when Voss had flung them into orbit without warning—this felt almost casual. Controlled. Deliberate.

But that didn’t last.

> “Talon Flight, confirm readiness for orbital boost,” Ember intoned.

> “Talon-2, ready.”

> “Talon-3, ready.”

> “Talon-4, standing by.”

Voss chimed in last. “Talon-1, cleared. Let’s take the high road.”

The HUDs flashed green. The familiar pulse beneath the cockpit returned—that subtle shift in engine tone, the whisper that things were about to become *unreasonable*.

> “Orbital engines primed. Atmospheric vector lock achieved,” Ember said.

They passed 68,000 feet.

> “Engage plasma thrust. Full ascent profile.”

And then the sky folded.

The Talons leapt upward as if shot from railguns. There was no afterburner flare, no roaring turbulence—only the hard, bone-deep *slam* of acceleration as the plasma drives engaged. The G-suits tensed. Dampers compensated. But still, the weight came.

> “Here we go again—” Adams grunted through clenched teeth.

Lindholm’s teeth rattled as the Mach indicator blurred past readable. The blue of the atmosphere peeled away into violet, then black. Clouds shrank to texture. Coastlines bent into curve.

Altitude: 140,000 feet.

Velocity: hypersonic.

Then—

Nothing.

The pressure vanished. The weight dropped away like a bad memory.

They were in low Earth orbit.

> “Talon Flight, orbital insertion complete,” Ember announced.

The HUDs reconfigured, velocity shifting to orbital units, attitude indicators now keyed to pitch-relative starlines and Earth’s slowly rotating frame below.

Adams exhaled loudly.

> “Every time, I *think* I’m ready for that. And every time, I’m *wrong*.”

> “It’s not supposed to feel normal,” Voss said. “But you’ll miss it once it does.”

Below them, the Pacific rolled across half the planet.

Ahead, the Moon awaited.

---

The Talons coasted above the world, weightless and sharp, arrayed in a loose diamond formation over the Pacific terminator line. Their engines were silent now, guidance thrusters whispering only when needed. Below them, Earth was quiet. Above them, everything else stretched out.

> “Begin orbital maneuvering drills,” Ember announced. “Maintain vector spacing. Execute pitch-yaw-roll sequences on mark.”

The HUDs shifted again, displaying artificial horizon bands keyed to orbital velocity and rotational axis. Maneuver prompts blinked in the periphery: translate, roll, reorient.

Adams nudged his stick, trying a slow roll—but it kept going too far, sluggish and over-rotated.

> “Damn it,” he muttered. “It’s like there's no resistance—nothing to push against.”

> “That’s because there isn’t,” Voss replied, angling his Talon effortlessly through a barrel roll. “Forget your instincts. Space doesn’t give you feedback like air does. Let the AI assist handle orientation damping.”

Lindholm toggled into assist mode and tried again—this time the Talon responded smoothly, coasting through the motion like it was tethered to an invisible rail.

> “There it is,” he said. “That’s better.”

Kraus tried a lateral drift, decoupling yaw from orientation. The Talon obliged, sliding sideways while still pointed at Earth. He didn’t speak, but his silence carried a certain grim approval.

Then a green square blinked into view on all their HUDs—hovering over a distant speck just off-center in the black.

> “[CMSA] Tiangong Station,” the callout read.

> “Oh look,” Voss said, half-joking, “the Chinese are probably watching us through their telescopes. Give 'em a good show!”

Adams grinned, locking into a corkscrew maneuver around his forward axis.

> “Well, we *did* wave at them underwater.”

> “They’re probably still losing sleep over that,” Lindholm added, executing a clean pitch-over into reverse drift.

The Talons began threading elegant spirals, matched rolls, and free-floating dogfight patterns. Their thrusters whispered against the void, creating geometric elegance against the stars—each maneuver coordinated not by calls, but by shared predictive modeling.

> “Keep moving,” Voss said. “Let your Talon read the scenario. You’re not flying anymore—you’re *positioning*. Velocity is just where you used to be.”

The Earth turned quietly below, brilliant and unaware.

In orbit, four shadows danced in view of a silent Chinese telescope.

---

The last maneuvering drill ended in perfect silence, four Talons drifting over the night side of Earth like hunting birds suspended in amber. Their HUDs marked the completion of all flight exercises. The Moon hung above them, silver and solemn, haloed in soft glare.

> “Drills complete,” Ember confirmed. “Ready for vector alignment.”

On cue, the Talons reoriented. Their HUDs recalibrated for long-range interbody flight, showing a clean vector spike arcing toward the Moon—just a quarter-million kilometers away.

A line appeared across their cockpits: *Lunar Trajectory Locked – Warp Initiation Pending.*

Adams adjusted in his seat, already bracing.

> “This is gonna be weird, isn’t it?”

> “Very,” Lindholm said. “Probably violently weird.”

There was a brief pause before Voss spoke—cool, steady, like he’d done this a hundred times.

> “I’m going to warp us all now,” he said into the channel. “Since I’m the wing commander, I have navigation override over you all. For your first time, I’ll be in control. Then you can do it on the way to Mars.”

Before anyone could argue, their cockpits shimmered with light. The HUD dimmed. A deep vibration passed through the airframe, like a taut string pulling tighter.

> “Warp initiation in three... two... one.”

Space bent.

No stars. No blur. Just motion inside stillness. A shimmering tunnel surrounded the Talons for less than a second, space itself parting like water.

And then—

They were in orbit around the Moon.

The grey surface rolled beneath them—impact craters sharp in low-angle sunlight, shadows stretching kilometers. Earth was a distant blue marble. No transition. No drift. Just arrival.

> “Welcome to Luna,” Voss said. “Next stop—combat.”

---

### Aboard Tiangong Station – Low Earth Orbit

“Radar contact. Multiple objects,” said Commander Guo, squinting at his monitor. “No thermal signatures. No comms. Not tracking like debris.”

Lieutenant Sun leaned in. The dots were *weird*. Not in pattern. No decay in orbit. Not a single retrograde trajectory.

> “That’s... not a satellite cluster,” he muttered. “Could be black project test vehicles?”

Guo frowned. “They just... disappeared.”

> “Sensor error?”

> “No. It was coordinated.”

Sun pushed away from the console, walking to the viewing panel. Then, an idea—he grabbed the fixed-range telescope, manually slewed it to the patch where the contacts had last been.

He peered through.

And saw nothing.

Except... a faint, shimmering afterimage in the black. A kind of tunnel, curling in on itself like starlight through warped glass, closing fast.

He blinked.

> “Did you see something?” Guo asked.

Sun lowered the telescope, still staring.

> “I... don’t know what I saw,” he said slowly. “But I don’t think we were supposed to see it.”

They stood there in silence, above a world that still believed in limits.

---

The Moon's surface crawled slowly beneath them, silent and vast, etched in cratered shadow and sunlit stone. Above the terminator line, the Talons floated in formation, waiting.

Then Ember’s voice returned.

> “Multiple signatures emerging from the lunar dark. Vectoring now.”

Nine targets bloomed onto the HUDs. Sleek, dart-shaped drones, burnished black with no visible markings. They surged into lunar orbit from behind the far side, fanning out like wolves spreading into a kill pattern.

> “Talon Flight,” Voss said calmly, “weapons free. Cut them down.”

Thrusters flared. The Talons surged forward, no sound but the whisper of system prompts and pilot breath.

> “Tracking two,” Adams called out. “No lock yet—moving *fast*.”

> “That’s because there’s no atmosphere to slow them,” Lindholm muttered. “They’re pure inertia.”

> “Then get creative,” Voss replied. “Space isn’t about reflexes. It’s about *command*. Say what you want. Let the Talon do the math, because you're definitely not fast enough to.”

As if on cue, Adams caught a missile launch from one of the drones.

> “Missile inbound! Missile—”

> “Countermeasures!” he barked.

The Talon obeyed instantly.

Flare-like particles deployed in a tight spiral, boosted by microbursts from lateral thrusters. The missile veered off-course, confused by a field of false vectors.

> “Talon-4, safe,” Ember confirmed.

Lindholm swerved under a drone, then caught himself drifting too fast.

> “Get me an intercept!” he snapped.

His Talon adjusted instantly, revectoring thrust and swinging into a clean arc that delivered him onto the drone’s tail. A short pulse from the plasma cannon carved it open in a flash of superheated debris.

> “One down,” he muttered.

> “Acknowledged. Eight remaining.”

Kraus turned hard, trying to outmaneuver a drone approaching from below.

> “It’s slipping under me—can't turn fast enough—”

> “Say it,” Voss cut in. “*Tell* it what you need.”

Kraus grit his teeth. “Get me nose-on!”

The Talon flipped *without* rolling, applying thrust along a new axis entirely. The nose snapped onto the target line as if gravity itself had been rewritten.

He fired. Direct hit.

> “Talon-2, target destroyed.”

Adams started to laugh, breathless. “It’s *listening* to us.”

> “Always was,” Voss replied, already mid-chase. “You’re just finally talking like a pilot.”

Above the Moon, four Talons danced among nine opponents.

And the future was learning to *fight*.

---

The last drone exploded in a silent blossom of vaporized metal, plasma shearing through its fuselage as Adams arced past in a high lateral drift.

> “That’s all of them,” Ember confirmed. “Nine hostile targets eliminated. Zero friendly losses.”

> “Damn right,” Lindholm said. “We’re starting to *feel* this.”

> “You’re starting to *listen*,” Voss corrected. His Talon floated above the Moon’s day side now, orbit steady, watching their vectors. “You’re not brute-forcing maneuvers anymore. You’re giving direction. Letting the Talon solve the problem.”

> “I still almost spun out twice,” Adams muttered.

> “You only *almost* did,” Voss replied. “That’s progress. And you didn’t try to muscle through it. You *asked*.”

The Moon drifted below them in silence, serene in its indifference.

> “Now,” Voss said, “next leg.”

A prompt appeared on each pilot’s HUD—*NAVIGATION MODE ENABLED*—and with it, the first layer of holographic interface shimmered into existence just beside the left side of their cockpits.

A floating menu hovered in the air, semi-transparent and crisp. At the top: *TRAVEL*.

One by one, they reached out and poked the air where the icon was.

The menu expanded.

Targets appeared:  
- **Luna** (grayed out)  
- **Mars**  
- **Jupiter**  
- **Belt Sectors Alpha–Delta**  
- **Jovian Shipyards**  
- **Cyno Point**  
- **Frontier Listening Post #1**

> “What the hell is *Cyno Point*?” Adams murmured.

> “You’ll find out,” Voss said. “Today? Mars.”

Each of them tapped *Mars*.

Next came *ALIGN*. The Talons pivoted in perfect silence, no engine sound, just smooth rotation as their frames shifted to face the distant glint of the red planet, suspended among a sea of stars.

Velocity: 3 m/s... 8... 15... 22...

As it hit *25 m/s*, a new icon blinked to life: *Warp to...*

The icon pulsed, waiting.

> “Don’t all press it at once,” Voss said. “Enjoy the solo ride.”

Lindholm reached first, tapping the pulsing glyph with a finger.

His Talon shimmered—and vanished into the tunnel.

Kraus followed with the precision of a man clicking an exact coordinate.

Then Adams, almost reverently.

Finally Voss. One light tap.

One flash.

And they were all gone, streaking through the fabric of space toward a red world waiting in silence.

---

The warp tunnel burst apart like glass shedding gravity. One by one, the Talons emerged into Mars orbit, trailing light like comets.

The red planet spun below them—rusted, windswept, and utterly alien. Olympus Mons loomed like a wound in the surface, the Valles Marineris stretching across the equator like the scar of a knife.

Silence reigned again—until Adams spoke, breathless.

> “Floating menus, warp drives, it's like I stepped into a video game...”

Voss gave a dry chuckle.

> “Feels like it, doesn’t it? That’s intentional. Game designers obsess over usability under stress. Talon interfaces took that lesson seriously. You can barely operate a tactile dashboard when you're dogfighting in atmosphere, and you *definitely* can't do it when you have a hundred more things competing for your attention in space.”

Lindholm rotated his Talon in a lazy arc, taking in the planet beneath them.

> “We just crossed a hundred million kilometers in four seconds.”

> “Warp’s good like that,” Voss said. “But it has limits. Minimum range is 100 kilometers—can’t activate it below that. No blinking around a city block. It's for interbody travel, not knife fights.”

> “Makes sense,” Kraus added. “And the rest of those targets back at the nav menu?”

> “Locked for now,” Voss said. “You’ll get access in time. Earn your wings out here first.”

The HUDs flickered—new threat vectors forming.

> “Combat Trial Two loading,” Ember announced. “Nine hostiles, high-aggression AI. Targets will attempt coordinated suppression and isolate you from support. You will succeed through cooperation, or not at all.”

Out of the orbital shadow, the drones emerged—larger than the lunar set, with thicker armor plating and tighter formation patterns. They flared their thrusters in brief pulses, already scattering to divide the Talons.

> “They’re faster,” Adams said.

> “They’re smarter,” Lindholm added.

> “And they’re not aiming for me,” Voss said. “Which means you’ve graduated to live team exercises. Fight together, or get picked apart.”

The first salvo launched—missiles streaking, lasers flaring.

> “Countermeasures!” Kraus barked, already veering.

> “I’ve got left!” Adams called. “Lindholm, on me!”

> “Copy! Looping high!”

> “Talon-2, Talon-4: flank and collapse. Intersect their midpoint,” Voss instructed calmly, not even flinching. “Watch the spin velocities—they’ll try to bait drift.”

The battle lit Mars’ orbit like a storm of precise fury. The Talons moved not as four aircraft, but as one *system*—intent, action, response. No hesitation.

This wasn’t a game.

But for the first time, they were starting to *play it well*.

---

The drones swept in fast—faster than the lunar batch. Their formations were tighter, firing patterns smarter, with flanking moves that forced the Talons to react in three dimensions. A textbook crosskill pattern, designed to overwhelm.

But the Talons weren’t flying alone anymore.

> “I’ve got two on me!” Adams shouted, veering hard starboard. “One’s tracking low!”

> “I see it,” Lindholm replied. “Cutting under!”

The Talons twisted through Mars orbit like water-borne blades, catching angles that shouldn’t have existed. A plasma bolt clipped Kraus across the nose—just as he pulled out of a climb.

His HUD flared red.

> “Direct hit! Dammit—”

But then, nothing. No damage. No warning tone. Just a soft shimmer of light over the canopy and a readout:

*SHIELD INTEGRITY: 91% — RECHARGING*

Kraus blinked.

> “It didn’t even scratch me.”

> “You don’t have to dodge everything,” Voss said over comms. “The shield can take hits. It recharges in seconds. Use that margin—*push* your angles.”

> “You could’ve told us that sooner,” Adams grumbled, rolling through a burst of hostile fire. Two shots splashed harmlessly against his wing’s field. The readout dipped—*87%*—then ticked back up within moments.

> “You didn’t ask,” Voss replied.

Lindholm took a missile square on the ventral section—his Talon bucked slightly, but stayed true. The HUD chimed:

*SHIELD INTEGRITY: 76% — STABILIZING*

> “I just *tanked* that,” he said, disbelief giving way to satisfaction. “I just *tanked* a goddamn missile.”

> “Good. Now pay it forward,” Kraus said, already looping to line up a kill.

Adams and Lindholm converged on one drone in a V-attack—Adams drawing fire, Lindholm closing from behind.

One pulse.

Drone gone.

Kraus took another under thrust, luring it into a spin before flipping nose-on and vaporizing it with a clean, calculated burst.

> “That’s six,” Ember announced. “Three remaining.”

> “Form pincer,” Voss instructed. “Push them off the orbital plane.”

The last three drones broke formation, but the Talons had found rhythm.

Lindholm shoulder-tanked a shot, barely flinching. Kraus intercepted a second. Adams pulsed through a cloud of fire, letting his shield soak the heat while he lined up the perfect reverse vector.

Three drones. Three hits. Three kills.

> “All hostiles eliminated,” Ember said. “Trial complete.”

Breath filled their cockpits, uneven but steady.

> “That’s the trick, isn’t it?” Lindholm said. “It’s not about avoiding everything. It’s about *knowing* what you can afford to take.”

> “Correct,” Voss replied. “Dodge when you must. Absorb what you can. Finish what you start.”

Below, Mars turned.

And above it, the future had just gotten meaner.

---

The warp tunnel dropped them into cold, cluttered space.

The asteroid belt sprawled in all directions, not the densely packed maze of science fiction, but a vast and scattered graveyard of rock and ice—thousands of bodies, some barely larger than a fighter, others the size of cities. Light from the distant Sun caught jagged surfaces, casting knife-edged shadows that flickered like motion.

The Talons reoriented immediately, HUDs shifting to full 3D mapping mode.

> “This is Trial Three,” Ember announced. “Mission objective: locate the stranded freighter *Caldera Echo*, exact position unknown. Once located, maintain defensive perimeter for sixty seconds while a simulated rescue vessel approaches.”

> “Asteroid belt?” Adams muttered. “Haven’t even *seen* an asteroid before today.”

> “You’ll see more than you want,” Voss replied. “This is ambush country. Shadows. Angles. Blind spots everywhere.”

Lindholm swept his Talon into a high spiral above the closest mass.

> “I’ve got nothing on visuals.”

> “You won’t,” Voss said. “Freighter’s cold. Running silent. You’ll need to work smarter.”

A new overlay appeared in their HUDs: *SENSOR FUSION ACTIVE*. A visual cone extended outward from each Talon, color-coded by pilot. The fields began to overlap.

> “What’s this?” Kraus asked.

> “Sensor fusion,” Voss said. “The Talons share real-time sensor data—thermal, radar, gravimetric, lidar. If *one* of you sees something, *all* of you see it. You’re not three ships. You’re one *lens*, wide as a battlespace.”

They fanned out.

The Talons drifted through the field, adjusting trajectory with soft bursts. Each rock they passed updated the map—adding contour, albedo, rotational velocity.

The darkness between the rocks shifted.

> “Seeing heat ghosting on rock delta-four,” Lindholm said. “Might be solar scattering.”

> “No engine plume, no hull shape,” Adams replied, studying the scan overlaid from Lindholm’s view. “Keep moving.”

> “I’ve got a shallow mass anomaly under that ridge,” Kraus said. “Too dense for the surrounding cluster.”

> “Share vector,” Voss said.

The HUD shifted again. Kraus’ visual data appeared in the others’ cockpits, layered in crisp wireframe.

> “We see it,” Lindholm confirmed. “Angle’s clean. Let’s check it.”

They moved as one—triangulating, spiraling inward, their sensors painting the interior of the belt as if sculpting it in real time.

So far, no sign of the *Caldera Echo*.

But in the shadows, *something* was watching them.

---

They edged closer to the mass anomaly, the three Talons sweeping through a slow banking arc above the irregular surface of a city-sized asteroid. The sensors pulsed every few seconds—returning echoes, tagging thermal ghosts and mineral pockets with automated IDs.

Then all three Talons flashed red.

> “Incoming fire!” Ember’s voice cut in. “Ambush pattern detected. Three hostile drones emerging from cover.”

The rock below them cracked open—no explosion, no fanfare. Just movement: three drones erupting from carefully timed positions between the shadows, hulls cold until the moment they struck.

> “Contact!” Adams shouted, veering instantly as a beam lanced past his canopy.

> “I’ve got left,” Lindholm snapped, peeling off into a dive behind the nearest fragmenting rock cluster.

> “Tracking center,” Kraus added, calmly.

The asteroid field became a cage.

The drones didn’t pursue in lines—they danced between cover, appearing and vanishing behind topographical shields of iron and ice, using the environment like seasoned predators.

But this time, the Talons were ready.

> “Share vectors,” Voss said. “No one sees alone.”

The sensor fusion grid flared brighter. Lindholm’s perspective popped into Adams’ side panel, showing the drone weaving between two long boulders. Kraus marked a predictive intercept vector. Adams took the angle.

> “Firing.”

A clean burst. The plasma beam curved around the rock’s edge like a scalpel through fog. First drone: destroyed.

Lindholm, now fully synced to the shared data, used Kraus’ thermal trail to time his thrust. He darted forward and shot through a narrow asteroid canyon, cutting his target in half at point-blank range.

> “Two down,” Ember reported. “One remains.”

Kraus didn’t pursue his drone. He baited it.

> “Get me an intercept,” he whispered.

The Talon adjusted silently, creating a false drift vector—shield shimmering just enough to draw fire. The drone committed. Kraus flipped nose-on without ever rotating the fuselage and fired before the drone could correct.

It vanished in a spray of molten fragments, scattering against the asteroid hull.

> “Target destroyed. All threats neutralized.”

Silence returned to the belt. Their sensor grid widened once more, resuming the search.

> “Well executed,” Voss said. “Now you’re not just flying. You’re *thinking as a system*.”

Adams exhaled. “And they didn’t even scratch us.”

> “Let’s keep it that way,” Kraus replied.

They reformed formation, angling deeper into the belt’s twisting geometry.

The *Caldera Echo* was still out there.

And whatever came next—*they’d be ready*.

---

The *Caldera Echo* revealed itself as a faint blip, hiding between two slow-rotating asteroids—wedged into a gravity pocket, nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding debris. The freighter was dark, its hull scorched in places, external systems cold. A beacon pulsed at low power, barely above noise threshold.

> “Contact confirmed,” Ember reported. “Stranded vessel *Caldera Echo* located. Begin perimeter defense. Rescue asset en route—arrival in sixty seconds.”

The three Talons fell into position, forming a loose, overlapping shield around the freighter, using the drifting rocks for partial cover and overlapping sensor coverage to seal the gaps.

> “Hold formation,” Voss instructed. “Expect company.”

It didn’t take long.

The shadows moved.

Small, fast signatures burst from behind surrounding asteroids—dozens this time. The drones were lighter than the last wave, but faster, and they came in waves: flanking, swarming, probing for a breach.

> “Drones inbound—multiple vectors!” Lindholm barked. “High-speed attackers!”

> “Here we go,” Adams muttered, adjusting his vector to meet the closest group.

His HUD flared—one drone flagged in red, a tactical suggestion blinking just below it.

> *Recommendation: Inferno suppression missile*

Adams didn’t think. His thumb went instinctively to the muscle memory point where the missile release would’ve been on his F-22.

The Talon responded instantly.

A belly hatch unfurled with surgical smoothness, a rotating cylindrical rack extending into vacuum. It spun precisely three stops before halting.

The missile launched without fanfare—just a faint glow and a straight line.

Two seconds later, it hit.

The Inferno missile bloomed with staggering ferocity—no concussive fireball, just a cascade of shaped plasma bursts detonating in precise intervals. Four drones in tight formation were obliterated instantly, fragments spinning like slag.

For a brief second, the surrounding field lit up like a miniature sun, shadows warping across nearby rocks.

> “Direct impact. Five drones neutralized,” Ember confirmed.

> “That’ll do it,” Adams whispered.

> “More incoming,” Kraus said. “North polar approach. Six at once.”

> “Break formation, but keep vector overlap,” Voss instructed. “Let them *think* there’s a gap.”

Lindholm slid off to one side, just wide enough to invite pursuit. Three drones took the bait, and the moment they committed, Adams and Kraus intersected with overlapping fire.

> “Another wave down.”

But more were coming—waves peeling off from every direction, hiding behind rocks, flanking through the belt’s geometry like practiced killers.

The rescue timer ticked down.

Sixty seconds never felt so long.

---

The drone waves kept coming—fractals of speed and precision, slipping through asteroid shadows, using the terrain to bleed off radar returns. But the Talons adapted. Every second of fire refined their cohesion. Every kill made their aim faster, their vector timing tighter.

Then Kraus’s HUD flashed—an alert ping, not from the *Caldera Echo*, but from beyond it.

A new contact.

Smaller, sleeker. Simulated drive flare.

> “Rescue ship inbound,” Ember confirmed. “ETA: 24 seconds.”

But it wasn’t alone.

> “They’re going for the rescue ship!” Kraus shouted. “Lindholm, help me get ’em off it!”

> “On your six,” Lindholm replied, already banking hard.

Three drones had broken from the central mass and sprinted toward the incoming vessel, hugging low against the rocks, using the dust wakes as concealment. Their target wasn’t defended, its heat signature climbing as it closed the distance to the freighter.

Adams swung high, flaring wide to maintain cover over the *Caldera Echo*.

Kraus and Lindholm streaked toward the drones. One broke left to harass them, but Kraus’s Talon was already locking.

> *Recommendation: Shard missiles – high-velocity tracking burst*

He didn’t wait. A tight cluster of warheads dropped from the bay—four glowing points that split mid-flight, hunting their targets like guided razors. One drone evaporated. The other two veered hard—into Lindholm’s line of fire.

His Talon flared again.

> *Recommendation: Netburst pattern*

He pressed the command.

A canister launched and split into a laced spread of detonations, flooding the field with ionized plasma. One drone was caught mid-maneuver, torn in half. The other dipped low—until Kraus surged in behind it and fired a tight plasma burst through its core.

> “Rescue ship is safe,” Ember confirmed. “Ten seconds to docking.”

Back by the freighter, Adams’s HUD lit red again.

More drones—four now—homing on the *Caldera Echo*, using the freighter’s silhouette as cover.

> “They’re trying to *mask* behind it,” Adams growled. “Oh no you don’t—”

> *Recommendation: Fragmentation seeker*

He deployed it without ceremony. The missile curved *around* the freighter, threading the space between two hull fins and bursting just behind the lead drone.

The others scattered—too late.

Lindholm looped back in and cleaned the rest with a pair of tight pulses, flying near upside-down against the rotating asteroid below.

> “Rescue ship docked,” Ember said.

> “Mission clock: complete.”

Silence fell across the belt, except for the sound of blood rushing in their ears.

And the distant hum of victory.

---

The asteroid belt spun on in silence. Around the *Caldera Echo*, debris from dozens of shattered drones glinted in the faint sunlight—frozen shrapnel in slow drift. The rescue vessel burned quietly away, trajectory locked for deep-space retrieval.

Inside the cockpits, breathing slowed. No more alarms. No more sensor pings. Just the soft, persistent hum of systems alive and content.

> “Well done,” Voss said, his tone measured but carrying something the three NATO pilots hadn’t heard from him before.

Pride.

> “You adapted. You worked as one. You didn’t panic when the swarm came, and you protected both assets. That’s what combat in space looks like. No terrain. No air. Just vectors, timing, and trust in the system.”

A quiet beat passed before he continued.

> “You used your shields *intelligently*. You relied on sensor fusion. You let the Talon *help you*. That’s the line between survival and burnout out here.”

None of the three spoke immediately. Not out of shock—but because they knew he was right. They had stopped *fighting the machine*.

They had started fighting *with it*.

> “Let’s go home.”

Their HUDs reconfigured. The *Travel* menu appeared again—floating at their fingertips, waiting for selection.

Each pilot reached out and tapped *Earth*.

The next menu appeared: *Align*. The Talons rotated together in smooth unison, snapping toward a new coordinate in the black.

Velocity rose: 5 m/s… 12… 18… 25…

The *Warp to...* icon pulsed, soft and inevitable.

One by one, they tapped it.

Space folded—and in less than a minute, they re-emerged just outside Earth’s upper atmosphere, caught in sunrise glint over the Pacific.

---

### Aboard Tiangong Station – LEO

“Sir, radar contact. Brief. High velocity. Low signature.”

Commander Guo frowned, stepping toward the console.

> “Display it.”

A blur—four returns, tightly spaced. Trajectory: descending rapidly, controlled vector.

Lieutenant Sun was already moving to the optical scope.

> “They’re descending. I—”

He froze.

> “Visual confirmation. Four objects. Black silhouettes. They’re... *dancing*. Controlled atmospheric reentry at that angle?”

Guo raised an eyebrow.

> “Debris?”

> “Debris doesn’t *maneuver*.”

Through the scope, Sun caught them for only a second—dark glints cutting across the stratosphere in perfect formation. Then they vanished into cloud.

> “Contact lost.”

Silence stretched long.

> “We saw nothing,” Guo said quietly.

> “Nothing at all,” Sun echoed.

And far below, four Talons traced ghost-lines through the sky, descending toward home.

---

The debrief room at Vandenberg felt almost too *normal* after the void-black silence of Mars orbit and the chaos of the belt. The seats were the same. The light hum of projectors. The bitter tang of bad coffee. But the people in the room—*they* knew something had changed.

Adams, Lindholm, and Kraus sat side by side, flight suits half-unzipped, all three visibly riding the afterglow of something they hadn't yet fully processed.

At the head of the room stood Mira Halden, flanked by Ember and a row of Federation officers in muted charcoal-gray uniforms. Beside them, observing quietly, was Brigadier General Harris, representing the U.S. Air Force, arms folded behind his back.

> “Today marks a milestone,” Halden began, voice steady. “Three Earth pilots—non-Federation—completed a full orbital combat qualification, trans-lunar operations, an interplanetary warp, and a live-fire perimeter defense in contested asteroid terrain.”

She turned slightly, letting the statement hang.

> “You are the first humans outside the Federation to experience warp travel. To execute coordinated Talon operations across multiple celestial bodies. And to return without error.”

That last line wasn’t just a compliment—it was a statement of baseline expectation.

Halden nodded toward Ember. The room lights dimmed, and the display filled with footage: orbital maneuvers, synchronized missile launches, the shimmering flash of the warp tunnel.

> “The Talon,” she continued, “is more than a weapon. It is a platform for *domain dominance*. No terrain, no medium, no speed or distance defines its limits. Only its pilot’s.”

She paused as the final image froze: the Talons in silhouette, backlit by Mars.

General Harris stepped forward.

> “I’ve commanded squadrons from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic Circle,” he said. “But I’ve never seen anything that can engage in atmospheric interception, orbital combat, submarine warfare, and deep-space interception in the same twenty-four hour window.”

> “Until now.”

He glanced at the three pilots.

> “What the Talon represents isn’t just superiority—it’s *flexibility*. You put this thing in the hands of a trained operator, and it turns a static battlefield into an elastic one. You don’t need to *respond* to threats. You get to *choose* where the fight happens.”

Lindholm leaned forward slightly.

> “Feels like cheating.”

> “Feels like winning,” Adams muttered back.

Halden gave the faintest smile.

> “That’s the point.”

The screen blinked out. Lights returned.

> “You’ll be returning to simulation drills tomorrow,” Halden said, “but for now—consider yourselves pioneers.”

And for the first time, none of them wanted to laugh at the word.

Because they *were*.

---

### People’s Liberation Army Strategic Intelligence Bureau – Beijing

The lights were dimmed in the subterranean briefing room, the only illumination coming from the screen at the front—split into two grainy feeds. One, a periscope-captured silhouette of a shadowy object weaving through the Pacific depths. The other, an optical snapshot from Tiangong Station, four black forms slicing through Earth’s upper atmosphere, glowing faintly as they broke reentry.

At the long table, a dozen military analysts sat tense, their expressions strained with the weight of the unexplainable.

Colonel Zhang stood with arms crossed, gaze fixed on the screen. He didn’t look back when he spoke.

> “We have two independent sightings. One underwater, the other in orbit. No common telemetry, no known configuration. Yet they are identical. Same dimensions. Same behavior.”

No one replied.

The silence lingered too long.

> “But they are American,” he added, more as an assertion than a question.

A few uncomfortable shifts around the table. Eyes flicked toward Liu, the senior technical analyst.

> “Unknown, sir,” Liu said carefully. “They were operating within U.S. naval and aerospace corridors with full freedom of movement. But considering how little we know, I think they could have done so in *any* nation's domain…”

He trailed off, choosing his next words with care.

> “And we would not have been able to stop them. Or detect them.”

Zhang’s jaw tightened. He turned fully now, eyes hard.

> “If this is a next-generation strike system, it is decades beyond anything in our black labs. You’re telling me our submarines and our orbital station both observed the same... ghosts?”

> “They left no emissions. No backscatter,” Liu said. “Even our AI-assisted frame analysis can’t determine a propulsion method. The one engaged by the *Hǎishì Yǐng* deployed no weapons, no signature. But it maneuvered like it had unlimited thrust and zero mass.”

> “And Tiangong?”

Liu gestured to the still image: four dark streaks over Earth.

> “Station recorded only seconds of data. But enough to match profiles. Perfect formation. Hypersonic descent through controlled reentry. No ablative flare. They disappeared into cloud at Mach 10.”

Zhang exhaled slowly. For a long moment, no one spoke.

Then he walked to the screen and tapped the blurred silhouette, frozen mid-frame, crossing the stars like a myth made metal.

> “Find out where these came from.”

> “Yes, sir,” Liu said.

But they all knew the truth: they weren’t going to find anything.

The mess hall at Vandenberg hadn’t seen this much laughter in a long time.

They’d been quiet at first—grateful, tired. But with each drink, the tension of asteroid duels and orbital war began to dissolve into something more human. Lindholm started telling a garbled version of how he “almost got sucked into Phobos,” which wasn’t even close to true, but no one corrected him. Kraus, ever stoic, even smirked once. Maybe twice.

Adams, halfway through a third glass of something that claimed to be whiskey, lifted it in a solemn toast.

> “To surviving space. And looking good doing it.”

> “You got singed by your *own* missile back there,” Lindholm reminded him.

> “That’s tactical shading,” Adams replied. “To confuse the enemy.”

Voss said little, nursing a glass of clear liquid and quietly enjoying the others for once without needing to steer them. They’d come a long way—from flinching at orbital maneuvers to flowing through coordinated deep-space combat. They’d earned a night.

They just didn’t know how short it would be.

---

### 03:12 Local Time – Vandenberg Operations Center

Red lights flared to life across the control room.

> “General alert. High-altitude intrusion over the eastern Pacific.”

Radar operators leaned in, scrolling through sweeps of the upper atmosphere. Something massive—fast, irregular—was entering from the west at impossible altitude.

> “Unidentified object. No IFF, no satellite trajectory match. Speed: 5,200 knots. Altitude: 74,000 feet. Crossing into air defense corridor now.”

Brigadier General Harris was already storming in, still pulling on his uniform jacket.

> “Get Talon Flight in the air—*now.*”

> “Sir, we’re trying. They’re—”

The aide hesitated.

> “What?”

> “They’re in the mess hall, sir.”

> “So?”

> “*Still there.*”

---

### 03:14 – Mess Hall

The general burst through the door.

It reeked of alcohol, sweat, and victory. Lindholm was sprawled half-asleep across a table. Adams was having an impassioned conversation with a vending machine. Kraus was upright, but his eyes were unfocused. Voss, the only one still mostly coherent, looked up.

> “Evening, sir.”

> “Don’t ‘evening’ me, Sergeant,” Harris snapped. “I’ve got a potential near-space contact coming in hot and *my* most advanced interceptor wing is currently *marinated*.”

He looked at all of them in disbelief.

> “You’ve been back *six hours*. You couldn’t pace yourselves?”

> “We paced,” Lindholm mumbled into his arm. “We just lost count.”

Harris rubbed his temples.

> “Unbelievable.”

> “Sir,” Voss said, rising slowly, “give us ten minutes, a hydration pack, and a straight walk to the hangar—”

> “You’ll black out before you reach the ladder.”

General Harris turned on his heel, storming out of the mess hall and barking orders into his comms.

> “Scramble conventional interceptors. Get the Raptors up now—I want eyes on that contact in five minutes!”

Behind him, Mira Halden had been watching with the same unreadable calm she always carried, hands folded behind her back. As Harris neared the door, she stepped up and tapped his shoulder once.

> “That might not be necessary,” she said quietly.

He turned, mid-step, eyes narrowing. “What?”

She lifted her phone-like device and spoke into it with quiet precision.

> “Ember, would you be so kind as to send Voss’s plane to investigate and handle this?”

> “Certainly, Ms. Halden. Talon One is launching momentarily,” came the AI’s smooth voice from the tiny speaker.

Harris blinked. “Voss’s—?”

Outside, across the paddocks, the low whine began to rise—soft at first, then unmistakable. Maintenance crews, who had been rushing to tow out a conventional interceptor, paused mid-motion. Heads turned.

Voss’s Talon was lighting up on its own.

The engine spool was unmistakable. Soft-blue plasma flickered beneath the nacelles. The aircraft shifted, its systems fully active. With no one aboard, no visible pilot, it began to taxi smoothly toward the runway under its own power.

> “Wait, if Voss is in here…” Adams said, trailing off as he turned toward the window, brow furrowing. “Then who’s flying that plane…?”

Voss, still seated at the table, lifted his glass in salute.

> “Nobody. Cheers.”

Outside, Talon One accelerated into the night.

---

Talon One climbed through the darkness on a smooth arc, guided by no human hands. Its plasma engines shimmered softly in the upper atmosphere, painting a halo behind it as it ascended toward the unknown contact—still classified by NORAD as an “unresolved high-altitude anomaly.”

At 81,000 feet, the target resolved visually. A large envelope, white and slow-moving, tethered beneath it an undercarriage bristling with sensors and antennas.

A Chinese surveillance balloon. Advanced, but nothing new.

Talon One didn’t hesitate.

---

```log
[INFO] ∷ Target lock confirmed. Classification: High-altitude surveillance balloon.
[INFO] ∷ Envelope radius: 38.2m. Payload mass: 741kg. Configuration: multi-band ELINT / synthetic aperture array.
[DEBUG] ∷ Passive emissions detected: Ka-band telemetry uplink, VHF redundancy, thermal masking system (active).
[INFO] ∷ Initiating full-spectrum scan.
```

---

Its nose-mounted aperture pulsed once—an invisible lattice of directed EM fields reached out, weaving through the balloon’s telemetry net like ghost fingers plucking threads.

---

```log
[DEBUG] ∷ Command protocol identified: 64-bit encryption, low-frequency handshake.
[INFO] ∷ Exploit library match: CN-SAT-VU27.
[INFO] ∷ Engaging infiltration routine.
[SUCCESS] ∷ Access granted. Payload telemetry accessed.
[INFO] ∷ Downloading onboard storage (16.2GB).
[INFO] ∷ Download complete. Purging uplink buffer.
```

---

Talon One drifted to the side, observing the tethered array for another moment. Inside the balloon’s electronics, data packets were unraveling—silently stolen, copied, replaced with null feedback loops.

Its mission complete, Talon One pulled slightly back, recalculated wind drift vectors, then realigned its trajectory.

A pulse of light.

The plasma cannon fired once.

---

```log
[INFO] ∷ Target neutralized.
[DEBUG] ∷ Envelope breached. Internal pressure collapse initiated.
```

---

The balloon tore open with a gentle puff, almost undramatic—until the payload housing ignited and tumbled earthward in a slow, terminal descent.

Talon One angled east, already curving into descent.

---

```log
[INFO] ∷ Returning to base. No hostile activity detected. Atmospheric integrity nominal.
[DEBUG] ∷ Operator override: not required.
```

---

And with that, it disappeared into the night—an automated ghost, silent and satisfied.

---

The Talon came in low and smooth, just a whisper on Vandenberg’s radar—its engines modulated to an almost ghostlike profile. It flared over the runway with eerie precision, decelerated gently, then rolled to a stop as if guided by the hand of some invisible pilot.

Hydraulic actuators hummed softly. The landing gear locked. Taxi lights flicked on autonomously as the aircraft turned itself toward the paddocks.

The air crews stood aside. No one touched it.

Talon One pulled into position, parked, and powered down without ceremony. The nacelle glow dimmed, HUDs faded, and the canopy remained closed. No cockpit opened. No canopy hissed.

Nothing moved.

The Talon was *done*.

---

Inside the mess hall, nobody had touched their drinks since the balloon disintegrated.

The screen above the bar had been hijacked by Ember, who—without being asked—had streamed the entire intercept in high fidelity. From liftoff to infiltration to the single, surgical plasma burst, it had unfolded in absolute silence.

Now, the screen showed only a quiet top-down view of the Talon as it rolled itself to sleep beneath the sodium lights.

Adams was the first to speak, eyes still glued to the screen.

> “That was... us.”

Lindholm nodded slowly.

> “Without the us part.”

Kraus didn't say anything. Just finished his glass, set it down carefully, and leaned back like a man trying to understand gravity all over again.

General Harris looked between them, jaw set, arms crossed, and clearly not sure if he should be impressed, horrified, or simply irrelevant.

Halden finally broke the silence from her corner.

> “Imagine what it’ll do once it *trusts* you.”

No one answered.

They just stared at the screen.

## Rogue Squadron

The early light of morning slanted across the conference room's steel-gray walls. The atmosphere was thick—not from fatigue, but from something heavier.

Displacement.

Adams, Lindholm, and Kraus sat side by side, eyes unfocused, coffee cups cooling untouched before them. Across the table, General Harris remained silent, arms folded tight across his chest. The screen above still displayed a paused frame of the Talon’s autonomous return: canopy closed, systems quiet, no human aboard.

> “It did the whole mission,” Adams finally said. “Took off, intercepted, scanned, neutralized, landed. All without us.”

> “Was perfect,” Lindholm added. “Precise. Clean. Controlled. We just… watched.”

Kraus didn’t say anything, but his jaw was tight, knuckles pale against the ceramic of his mug.

General Harris broke the silence with a low growl.

> “If it doesn’t need pilots, then what the hell are we *training* you for?”

The question lingered.

Then Voss spoke.

> “Because most missions *aren’t* that clean.”

He was standing by the wall, arms loose, voice flat but sharp.

> “That was a routine intercept of a non-maneuvering target. A sensor sponge floating on a weather draft. That’s what we *let* the Talon handle alone.”

Halden, standing beside him, nodded once.

> “The Federation only runs the Talon unmanned on patrol routes, atmospheric survey missions, and non-escalation engagements. You saw one of those. Not combat.”

> “So we’re here for the hard stuff?” Lindholm asked, still skeptical.

> “You’re here,” Halden replied, “for the fights where AI will *lose*.”

That got their attention.

> “AI is fast. Cold. Logical. But it doesn't improvise. It doesn’t gamble. It doesn’t *lie*. It doesn’t break its own rules to win.”

> “You do,” Voss added. “You *can*.”

Adams leaned back, eyes on the paused screen. “Feels backwards. Machine flying while we’re drunk in a mess hall.”

> “No,” Voss said. “That was exactly how it was *meant* to work.”

Halden stepped forward, folding her arms.

> “But don’t mistake utility for replacement. You are not the backup plan.”

> “You’re the *point*.”

The room fell quiet again—but this time, the weight had shifted.

They weren’t obsolete.

They were being *sharpened*.

---

Weeks passed, and the rhythm of Vandenberg had changed.

More Talons arrived, each one sliding off the heavy transport rails with smooth, mechanical elegance. Flight crews became fluent in their maintenance rituals. Engineers in Federation black ran diagnostics with handheld devices that glowed with unfamiliar characters. And always—new pilots. NATO, then select partner nations. All handpicked. All watched.

Adams adapted quickly.

He no longer second-guessed the aircraft. He didn’t fight its logic—he *leaned* into it. By now, he could transition from Earth orbit to surface lockdown with less effort than he once needed for midair refueling. He trusted the Talon like he once trusted his own bones.

And now, he had a wingman.

Jessica Parker, callsign “Spitfire,” USAF. Former F-15E Strike Eagle pilot, two deployments over the Taiwan Strait, and a steady hand with none of the bravado. She took to the Talon like she was born in its cockpit—quiet, quick-thinking, a perfect mirror to Adams’s tempo.

The two of them were running an altitude sweep over the Mojave when the alert hit.

> “General alert. Unauthorized airspace penetration over Taiwan. Two PLAAF J-20 fighters violating ADIZ protocol. Trajectory suggests direct challenge posture.”

The operations room lit up with motion. Ember’s voice rang clear in Adams’s helmet before he even banked homeward.

> “Talon Flight Two-One, prepare for intercept. Standby for orbital vector.”

> “You’ve got to be kidding,” Adams muttered, pulling into a tight climb. “Again?”

Parker’s voice came through crisp.

> “Bet they’re already broadcasting how ‘lost’ they are.”

> “And we’re the welcome committee.”

> “Better than the funeral detail.”

Command’s voice replaced Ember’s.

> “Talon Two-One and Two-Two, you are cleared for immediate orbital launch. Authorization vector uploaded. Objective: intercept and escort PLAAF assets out of Taiwanese airspace. Avoid escalation.”

> “Copy that,” Adams replied, his Talon already pivoting for ascent. “We’re on it.”

Below, the desert fell away.

Above, trouble waited.

---

The Talons launched as one.

Adams and Parker punched skyward, engines humming low and steady as their airframes sliced the upper troposphere. At 70,000 feet, the transition began—turbine fade-out, plasma drive initiation, the sudden *snap* of weightlessness as the sky gave way to the high black.

> “Suborbital vector locked,” Ember announced.

> “Standby for high-strike arc,” Adams said, mostly for Parker’s benefit.

> “Copy. Let’s scare someone.”

The Talons accelerated—not just fast, but *upward* in a ballistic arc that would’ve made an ICBM envious. The curvature of Earth swept into full view below them, the Pacific stretching vast and silent. Inertial dampers took the worst of it, but still, Adams felt the *weight*—that strange sensation of velocity without sound.

They crested near the edge of space, just long enough to ride the vacuum.

Then came the drop.

Reentry was controlled, quiet, and surgical. The Talons used their own atmospheric friction to brake, angling into Taiwan’s defense corridor like falling stars given guidance. Their skins glowed faintly red before cooling just as fast.

Two J-20s, sleek and gray, cruised along the ADIZ edge, their vector unapologetically eastward—toward Taiwanese airspace, broadcasting ‘navigation error’ in clipped Mandarin.

They never saw it coming.

The Talons dropped in from vertical, silent and sudden—black silhouettes against the sky, so unnatural they seemed like hallucinations at first.

The Chinese pilots flinched.

One wobbled for a moment in confusion, the other banking instinctively.

> “They see us,” Parker said dryly.

> “Yeah. And now they’re thinking.”

Both J-20s corrected course and veered south, posture suddenly meek. No evasive maneuvers. No challenge. Just a clean, quiet withdrawal—like men who’d seen something they weren’t cleared to understand.

> “Contact is complying,” Ember confirmed.

---

The J-20s leveled out, heading southwest at a respectable clip. They weren’t broadcasting anything now—not even the usual excuses. Just silence.

Adams and Parker dropped in alongside them, matching speed and altitude with chilling precision. The Talons flew tight to their flanks, offset just enough for visual clarity. Sunlight caught the curves of their matte-black fuselages, and for the first time, the full USAF insignia—unmistakable—was clearly visible on the Talons’ sides.

Adams tilted slightly, just enough to make eye contact through the other pilot’s canopy.

The Chinese pilot stared back, frozen behind his visor, trying to make sense of the strange aircraft beside him. No visible intakes. No hardpoints. No sound. And yet—there it was, holding station perfectly.

Inside, Adams gave a little wave.

Parker did the same on the other side.

They stayed like that—escorting ghosts—for another hundred kilometers, right up to the invisible boundary of Chinese airspace. The moment the J-20s crossed back into the mainland flight corridor, Adams and Parker eased up and out, pulling into a wide arc above them.

Both Talons tipped their wings once—clean, deliberate.

Goodbye.

Then the plasma drives kicked back in, and the Talons punched upward in perfect sync—cutting through the atmosphere and vanishing into the black, tracing a suborbital return path back to California.

### People’s Liberation Army Strategic Intelligence Bureau – Beijing

The room was quiet save for the rhythmic clatter of keystrokes and the hum of filtered ventilation. On the screen, a grainy feed from a high-altitude surveillance drone played in a continuous loop: two angular, black aircraft descending from the stratosphere with terrifying grace, flanking two J-20s, and then ascending again on what analysts had confirmed was a suborbital trajectory.

Colonel Zhang watched in silence.

> “This is the third recorded encounter,” said Liu, standing beside the projection. “One underwater, one in orbit, and now this—an overt deployment over the Taiwan Strait.”

> “And still no confirmation of origin beyond circumstantial association with the United States,” Zhang said flatly.

> “Yes, sir. But this time, they bore USAF insignia. Deliberately. Clearly visible to both radar and optical systems. If they were intended to be deniable before, they are not now.”

Zhang narrowed his eyes at the screen as the Talons tipped their wings and vanished upward in unison.

> “You’re saying the Americans wanted us to see them.”

> “It appears so.”

Around the table, aides shifted uncomfortably. One, a younger analyst, spoke up.

> “It’s unclear if these are manned or unmanned. No heat signatures from the cockpit regions. No EM leakage we can trace. And their flight paths defy known thrust-vectoring capabilities. There is no exhaust, and they reenter from suborbital altitudes without thermal flare.”

> “But they don’t *engage*,” Zhang said. “They simply arrive. Watch. Leave.”

> “Dominance posturing,” Liu added. “Without the need to fire a shot.”

Zhang exhaled slowly.

> “And we let them walk our pilots home. Like escorts.”

Silence settled again.

The implications were vast. No EM jamming. No visible weapons. Just unchallenged presence and impossible performance. That was all the Talon had shown—and it was more than enough.

> “Have we lost initiative in the Strait?” someone asked, voice quiet.

Zhang didn’t answer immediately.

Instead, he studied the still frame of the two Talons holding position alongside the J-20s. Unmoving. Unshakable.

> “We’ve lost *exclusivity*,” he said finally. “And that is worse.”

He looked to Liu.

> “Reassess all regional engagement thresholds. If this platform can deploy globally and engage at will, we no longer control the tempo. They do.”

> “Understood, sir.”

Zhang folded his arms and kept watching the screen—two black silhouettes, flying with casual impunity.

---

### Russian General Staff Intelligence Directorate (GRU) – Moscow

The projector flickered slightly in the gray-lit chamber beneath Khoroshovskoye Highway. On screen: low-resolution footage of two black aircraft intercepting a pair of J-20s above the Taiwan Strait. The image was grainy, the metadata stripped—yet it had arrived in Moscow’s secure network inbox with little fanfare and *no attribution*. It wasn’t hard to guess the source.

Colonel Mikhailov leaned forward, hands clasped under his chin, as the footage replayed for the third time.

> “Same frame geometry as the high-atmosphere objects seen by Tiangong,” said Captain Voronov, gesturing with a laser pointer. “Exact dimensions match. Flight envelope still unconfirmed—acceleration models show G-forces well outside human tolerances.”

> “So it’s a drone?”

> “Could be. Could also be *not*. We don’t know.”

Another officer scrolled through enhanced stills—those bizarre silhouettes hovering beside the Chinese fighters, seemingly unafflicted by drag, wake turbulence, or even gravity. The data was real. That much was clear.

Too real.

> “These files were leaked,” Mikhailov muttered. “They want us to see this. Want us to analyze it. *They* don’t know what they’re looking at either.”

He turned to the room.

> “Anyone want to wager what the Chinese do when *they* can’t explain something?”

No one replied.

The screen paused on a frame of the Talon tipping its wing in farewell.

Mikhailov drummed his fingers on the desk.

> “If this is American, then it's years beyond what we’ve tracked. If it’s not... then the Americans are flying something that belongs to someone else.”

A long silence.

Then a dry chuckle from the back of the room.

> “Or both.”

Mikhailov leaned back.

> “Get this to Aerospace Command, Signals Intelligence, and the Tula lab. And someone call the SVR. I want every traceable signature from that intercept run cross-checked against everything we’ve ever picked up over the Pacific. I don’t care if it’s from a fishing boat radio—if it blipped during that window, I want it in the model.”

He stood.

> “Because I don’t like mysteries in American airspace that *China* is asking us to solve.”

---

### Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) Technical Bureau – New Delhi

A wall of screens cast their pale light across the room’s matte black surfaces. Engineers and analysts stood clustered around one feed in particular—video from the Tiangong station, another from the South China Sea, and now, the unmistakable footage of two aircraft appearing over the Taiwan Strait and guiding Chinese jets back toward home like sheepdogs with wings.

At the head of the room, Director Pranav Mehta sighed heavily and tapped the table with the end of his pen.

> “Three data points,” he said. “Same object. Same flight profile. And now the Chinese are feeding us these leaks like breadcrumbs to a shrine they don’t understand.”

> “They want us to see it,” one analyst said. “They want *everyone* to see it.”

> “Because they’re hoping we’ll recognize something they missed,” Mehta replied. “Which we haven’t.”

The footage rolled again. Frame by frame. The Talons tipped their wings and surged upward into suborbital trajectory, leaving no contrails, no heat blooms, no EM chatter.

A physicist from DRDO stepped forward, arms crossed.

> “We’ve analyzed the launch vectors, propulsion shape, flight time, everything. The intercept path from California to the Strait in under five minutes is physically impossible for conventional aircraft. But it’s there. And clean.”

> “Could it be a suborbital drone with unknown drive systems?” someone asked.

> “If it is,” Mehta said, “it’s flying laps around our entire concept of airpower.”

Another analyst, younger, slid a tablet across the table.

> “We ran signatures through all foreign experimental aviation profiles. No match. No transponder bleed. Not even anomalous gravimetric wake.”

> “Then we’re left with deduction,” Mehta said. “Either this is American—something black, something deep—or something *new* entirely. But either way, China has no idea what they saw. That’s why they’re letting *us* see it.”

He turned to the projection, eyes narrowing.

> “They’re scared. And they’re crowd-sourcing their fear.”

Silence.

> “Keep digging,” Mehta said. “And alert Prime Minister’s Office. Not urgent. Not yet. But keep them awake.”

---

### Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office – Tokyo

The lights were low in the secure conference chamber, but the tension hung like static. A still frame of the Taiwan Strait intercept held on the central screen: two matte-black aircraft flanking a pair of Chinese J-20s, guiding them away like shepherds with no visible weapons drawn.

The assembled officials said little at first. There was nothing to *add*. The video, like the previous two clips—submarine periscope and Tiangong scope—had all arrived through the same quiet backchannel. Everyone in the room knew the source.

> “China’s rattling its own cage,” said Deputy Director Ishikawa, fingers steepled in front of him. “This isn’t a leak. This is an *invitation*. They’re hoping someone else will make sense of the ghosts they can’t explain.”

A civilian advisor from the Ministry of Defense leaned forward, the corner of his mouth twitching with restrained calculation.

> “There’s opportunity here. If China can be spooked like this, we may have an edge in regional deterrence. Same with Pyongyang. We just have to be seen standing close to whoever flies those things.”

Ishikawa gave a faint, humorless smile.

> “If it’s the Americans?”

> “Then we make sure they keep flying.”

> “And if it’s *not* them…?”

That hung longer than anyone liked.

A tech analyst finally broke the silence.

> “We’ve run the data against every known prototype in the US arsenal. B-21s, X-planes, even edge-case DARPA entries. Nothing fits. Flight time from California to the Strait? Four minutes. Suborbital. With no observed launch platform.”

> “So either the Americans have *broken* everything we know about propulsion,” Ishikawa said, “or they’ve acquired something they didn’t build.”

> “Either way,” the MoD advisor murmured, “they’re flying it now. And no one else is.”

Ishikawa stood.

> “Draft an optics plan. We start posturing alongside U.S. squadrons—air shows, joint drills, observer deployments. If someone’s flying that thing, we want to be close enough that the *next* footage includes a Hinomaru too.”

> “And if the Americans ask why?”

> “We tell them the truth.” Ishikawa’s smile returned, thinner this time. “We like to stay close to our gods.”

The screen dimmed.

But the shadows behind it only deepened.

---

### Weeks Later – Across the Globe

The images had gone farther than the Chinese ever intended.

Grainy stills, slowed-down footage, sensor-blurred shapes—mysterious craft with impossible flight profiles, eerie silence, and unmatched speed. Everyone had seen them. Intelligence services in Ankara, Riyadh, Brasília, even Pretoria had received the same shadowed frames, each tagged with unofficial requests for analysis, “independently sourced.”

No one could explain what they were.

But everyone now knew *who* they flew with.

The United States said nothing, officially. The Pentagon neither confirmed nor denied the footage, and the White House never spoke a word. But those aircraft had flown over Taiwan. They had escorted Chinese fighters without resistance. They had returned home untouched. And the world had watched it all unfold without warning.

And that was all that mattered.

In Pyongyang, rocket launches were postponed. In Tehran, drone deployments suddenly shifted back to “testing” operations. The Russian Pacific Fleet, weeks earlier preparing another “freedom of navigation exercise,” now lingered behind its usual line.

The powder keg still sat under the table.

The rivalries, the grudges, the ambitions—they hadn’t gone away.

But no one wanted to strike the match.

Because somewhere out there—above them, beneath them—flew something that didn’t play by anyone’s rules.

And the worst part?

It never needed to say a word.
