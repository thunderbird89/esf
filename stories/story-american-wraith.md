## Shadows in the Kremlin

The CIA's headquarters buzzed with its usual activity—flashing monitors, agents on calls, and the low hum of an endless war of information. Amid this orchestrated chaos sat Alicia Monroe, a senior field agent handler in the agency's Russia division. Her desk was littered with decoded intercepts, a stack of coffee-stained briefing folders, and a blinking alert on her secure terminal.

She frowned. Her asset, codenamed *Nightingale*, had missed a critical check-in. Nightingale operated deep in Moscow, embedded in circles too close to the Kremlin for anyone’s comfort. His last message suggested he’d uncovered something explosive—proof of a clandestine project that even the CIA’s best efforts couldn’t crack.

Alicia tapped her pen against her notepad, her unease deepening. She had no direct way of reaching Nightingale now without jeopardizing him further. Moscow was a fortress of counter-intelligence, and the Kremlin's hunters were among the best in the world. Sending an extraction team would be a death sentence. 

She leaned back, staring at the ceiling tiles, seeking clarity. She needed help—unconventional, impossible help. A half-formed thought tugged at the edge of her mind: the Federation. 

It was a rumor whispered in agency cafeterias and drunken confessions. An entity that operated beyond the reach of nations, armed with technology that defied belief. Officially, the Federation didn’t exist, but the stories... they painted a picture of an organization that was everywhere and nowhere at once. Their calling card was as ominous as their legend: *We Are Watching*.

With a humorless laugh, Alicia muttered under her breath, “If you’re real, Federation, now would be the time to prove it.”

Her phone buzzed sharply on her desk. She stared at the screen, her pulse quickening. An email had appeared in her secure inbox, its subject line blank except for one sentence: 

**Ask and ye shall receive.**

She clicked the message open, her eyes locking on the signature.

**—The Federation**

Alicia’s heart pounded. A shadow of hesitation crossed her mind, but it was swallowed by resolve. If the Federation was real, if they truly had eyes where no one else could see, then Nightingale’s survival might rest in their hands.

---

Alicia glanced around the room, her incredulity giving way to a creeping unease. She was alone, but the sudden responsiveness of an entity she had all but thought mythical made her feel anything but. 

Swallowing hard, she murmured, "Nightingale, Moscow. I need to get him out." 

Her words seemed to hang in the air, swallowed by the ambient hum of the office. For a moment, nothing happened, and Alicia exhaled, relieved and almost embarrassed by her own desperation.

Then her phone buzzed again.

She snatched it up, her breath catching as she read the newest email:

**Two days.**

No sender. No encryption stamp. Just those two words in stark black text.

Alicia’s grip tightened around the phone, her mind racing. Two days? Two days for what? Extraction? Confirmation of his status? Or was this some cruel prank, a signal she’d finally cracked under the pressure of managing too many lives and playing too many games with too little sleep?

Her stomach churned as she lowered the phone onto her desk, careful as though it might explode. Every protocol she had been drilled in screamed at her to report the incident, escalate it to her superiors, or at least log it in the system. Yet, something held her back. 

She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the desk and clasping her hands together, her knuckles pale. **What had she just done?**

The Federation wasn’t supposed to be real. It was a joke passed between analysts in the break room, a convenient scapegoat for unexplained phenomena. A ghost story. Yet here she was, staring at what might be the first tangible proof of their existence—a group so secretive and powerful they made the CIA look like amateurs playing with tin cans and string.

And she’d called on them. Just like that. No backup plan, no clearance, no control. **What was I thinking?**

Her mind circled back to Nightingale. The man had risked everything to get intel back to her. He was resourceful, careful, and unshakable—until now. Whatever had taken him off-grid wasn’t just a random stroke of bad luck. Something had gone wrong, and if there was even a chance this shadow organization could pull him out, she had to let them try.

But the implications... 

Her career, her agency’s integrity, her very life could be on the line. If this was real, if she had just reached out to a force that played by no one’s rules, what price would they demand in return? 

Her phone’s screen went dark, and in the reflection, she saw her own face, pale and drawn. Her jaw tightened, and she forced herself to breathe deeply. 

Alicia whispered, "Two days." The words tasted foreign on her tongue, a promise or perhaps a curse. Would she spend the next forty-eight hours waiting for salvation—or ruination?

Her gaze flicked to the phone once more, but it remained silent, its screen a blank, unyielding void. 

Her hands curled into fists. She couldn’t afford to unravel now. If this was real, she’d need to be ready—for anything. And if it wasn’t, then the clock was ticking for Nightingale, and she was wasting precious time chasing shadows.

She reached for her coffee, barely noticing the slight tremor in her fingers. Two days. **I might have just invited the devil into my house,** she thought grimly. **God help me if I’ve made the wrong call.**

## The Edge of the Knife

The safe house reeked of damp concrete and stale cigarettes. Marcus Adams—codenamed *Nightingale*—sat on the edge of a creaking cot, one hand gripping his sidearm and the other cradling his head. The dim light from a single bare bulb above cast long, restless shadows across the room, amplifying the oppressive silence. 

He hadn’t slept in two days. 

His safe house was little more than an abandoned workshop, its walls mottled with mildew and its windows covered in grease-smudged newspaper. Every sound outside—the rumble of a passing car, the bark of a stray dog—felt amplified, a potential harbinger of the GRU teams he was sure were closing in.

Marcus glanced toward the boarded-up window at the front of the workshop. From his sliver of visibility, he’d seen the checkpoints go up early that morning, plainclothes men with sharp eyes and hard stances inspecting every vehicle. GRU, no question about it. They were looking for someone, and he had no delusions about who that might be.  

His stomach churned as he considered his options. None of them were good.  

He couldn’t stay here; the safe house was compromised, and it was only a matter of time before someone knocked on the flimsy steel door with less-than-friendly intentions. But slipping out would be nearly impossible. The perimeter was locked down, and Moscow’s unforgiving winter offered little hope of disappearing into the crowd without drawing attention. 

He picked up his encrypted satphone, his lifeline to the CIA, and stared at the screen. There was no point in calling it now. He’d already missed his last check-in, and if Alicia hadn’t already declared him lost, she’d be close to it. Even if he reached out, what could they do? Moscow wasn’t a place you extracted someone from without a full-scale operation—and even then, the odds were slim.

No, he was on his own.

Marcus cursed under his breath and set the phone down. His fingers brushed against a packet of cigarettes he’d taken off a dead drop three weeks earlier. He didn’t smoke, but he’d been considering taking it up lately. Instead, he fished out a small plastic capsule from the same packet. A last-ditch insurance policy. One squeeze, and everything he knew, everything he was, would vanish in a matter of minutes.  

He clenched his jaw and stuffed the capsule back into his jacket. Not yet.

His mind raced through contingency plans, every one of them fraught with uncertainty and danger. Could he slip past the checkpoints and find another bolt-hole? Bribe someone for safe passage? Take the fight to them and hope for the best? Each scenario played out in his head, and each ended the same way—with him bleeding out in the snow, another nameless corpse in a cold Russian morgue.

A low growl outside broke his thoughts. A black sedan idled near the workshop, its headlights washing over the boarded windows. Marcus froze, the hair on his neck standing on end. Through a crack in the boards, he saw two figures emerge from the car. One lit a cigarette, the ember glowing faintly in the gloom. The other leaned against the vehicle, his eyes scanning the street with the casual menace of someone who knew he was hunting prey.

Marcus’s grip tightened on his pistol. He couldn’t stay here. His time was up.

He moved to the rear of the workshop, where a crude escape route led to an alleyway. He’d rehearsed the route dozens of times, but now, with adrenaline pounding through his veins, every step felt weighted with finality.  

The satphone buzzed on the table behind him. He stopped mid-step, a cold knot forming in his gut. Slowly, he turned back and picked it up, half-expecting a trace program or a detonation. Instead, the screen displayed a simple message, one that made his breath hitch:  

**“Hold. Help is coming.”**

No sender. No signature.  

His first thought was that it had to be a trap. The GRU’s reach was deep, and their disinformation tactics were legendary. But something about the message gave him pause. The words were calm, confident, almost... omniscient.  

Marcus’s instincts screamed at him to ignore it and run. But he hesitated, his eyes flicking to the black sedan still parked outside, its occupants growing restless.  

The satphone buzzed again, another message appearing:  

**“Trust us.”**  

His pulse thundered in his ears. He didn’t trust anyone—not here, not now. But as he stared at the screen, something in him shifted. Maybe it was exhaustion, maybe desperation. Or maybe, just maybe, it was a sliver of hope.  

He clenched his jaw and stepped back from the escape route, his gun still in hand. For better or worse, he was staying.  

---

The knock at the door was light but deliberate, cutting through the tension in the dingy workshop like a blade. Marcus froze, his hand gripping his sidearm as he crept toward the door. His heart hammered as he peeked through the peephole.

Three construction workers stood on the other side, their orange vests and tool belts at odds with the predatory stillness that lingered about them. Two men and one woman, all grungy and unremarkable—except for their eyes. They scanned the surroundings with sharp precision, like they weren’t here to install drywall.

His phone buzzed in his pocket, jolting him. Slowly, he pulled it out and glanced at the screen.  

**“Your help is here.”**

Marcus hesitated, his instincts torn between suspicion and the flicker of hope he’d felt since the first message. Help or trap? He couldn’t afford to second-guess now. He slid the deadbolt back and cracked the door open, keeping his pistol hidden but ready.

The woman at the front gave him a brief, professional nod. “Nightingale?”

He nodded warily.

“Let us in. We don’t have much time,” she said, her voice calm but firm.

Marcus opened the door, stepping back as the three entered. They moved quickly, shutting the door behind them and scanning the space with practiced efficiency. One of the men, stocky with a buzzcut, positioned himself near the boarded-up window, peeking out discreetly. The other, tall and wiry, unpacked a bag filled with tools and what looked like small electronic devices.

The woman, presumably the leader, pulled off her scuffed hard hat, shaking loose a cascade of dark curls. Without preamble, she set a few items on the rickety table: a nondescript smartphone, a pad of paper, a few pens, and a sheet of thin, cellophane-like material that caught the dim light like oil on water. She grabbed a chair and turned it toward Marcus.  

“Sit down. We need to work quickly,” she said, gesturing for him to take a seat.  

Marcus sat reluctantly, his pistol still in his lap under the table. “Who are you people?”

“We’re the people keeping you alive,” she replied, not bothering to look up as she spread out the cellophane sheet. Her voice carried no warmth, just urgency. “Face forward.”

“What’s that?” he asked, eyeing the cellophane warily.

“Your ticket out of Moscow,” she said briskly, tapping the smartphone a few times before leaning in toward him. “Stay still.”

Before Marcus could protest, she pressed the sheet over his face with quick, practiced hands. It clung unnaturally to his skin, conforming perfectly to the contours of his nose, cheeks, and chin. He tensed, expecting to choke or suffocate, but the material felt oddly breathable, cool against his skin.

“Relax,” she said, swiping at the smartphone again. “It’s just a face dancer mask.”

“A what?”

She didn’t answer. Instead, she held up a small mirror from her tool bag. Marcus’s breath caught. The face staring back at him wasn’t his own. It was older, heavier, with deep-set eyes and a faint scar running along one cheek.  

“Congratulations, you’re Ivan Petrov,” she said, tapping the phone once more. The cellophane shifted slightly, and the new face in the mirror frowned in perfect sync with his expression.

Marcus reached up, his fingers brushing against the mask. It didn’t feel like anything was there. “How is this even possible?”

“Don’t think too hard about it,” she said, packing up the remaining tools. “This’ll fool cameras, biometric scanners, even vein mapping. But it’s not bulletproof, so don’t get careless.”

The wiry man at the door spoke up, his voice low. “GRU’s moving in. They’re setting up closer.”

“Then we’re ahead of schedule,” the woman said. She turned back to Marcus. “You follow my lead, do exactly what I say, and we’ll get you out of this city alive. No questions, no hesitation. Understood?”

Marcus nodded, the weight of the situation settling fully on him. These people moved with the precision of professionals, their tools and methods unlike anything he’d seen before. Whoever they were, they weren’t just here to help—they were here to win.  

The woman gave a thin smile, the first sign of humanity in her otherwise mechanical demeanor. “Good. Then let’s get moving.”

**Chapter 2: Ripples in the Dark**

Alicia Monroe sat at her desk in the CIA’s Russia Division, her eyes fixed on the blinking cursor of her terminal. The sterile hum of the office surrounded her, punctuated by the occasional murmur of agents talking in low voices or the faint ding of an elevator arriving. But none of it registered. Her thoughts were miles away, in the shadowed streets of Moscow, chasing a phantom thread of hope.

She hadn’t been able to shake the weight of the decision she’d made. The cryptic email from the so-called Federation was seared into her mind: *Ask and ye shall receive. Two days.* It felt as though she had stumbled into a world she didn’t understand, where the rules weren’t written in any handbook and her carefully cultivated instincts as an agent were rendered moot.

A steaming mug of coffee sat untouched beside her keyboard. Alicia had barely slept, her mind replaying the moment she’d uttered that desperate plea to the empty room. She didn’t know what had possessed her to say it—or what to make of the response that followed. Was it even real? Could she trust it? She knew better than to rely on hope, but the alternative was admitting that she’d left Marcus Adams to die in a city where survival was a long shot at best.

Her phone buzzed on the desk, and she flinched. Picking it up, she saw a message from her team lead:

**“Ops brief at 1400. Be ready.”**

Alicia exhaled sharply, setting the phone down with a faint clatter. She didn’t want to sit through another briefing about how the Kremlin’s grip on its sphere of influence was tightening. She didn’t want to hear the latest grim assessments about Russia’s counterintelligence crackdown. What she wanted was news—any news—about Nightingale.

She reached for the phone again, hesitating for a moment before opening her secure communication app. The text log from Marcus stared back at her, stark and empty. No pings, no updates, no sign of life. The last message he’d sent was still burned into her memory: *I’ve got something big. Too big.*  

Alicia leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes. *Two days.* What did that mean? Would someone reach out? Would she receive a report? A body? Or nothing at all? 

Her thoughts spiraled into darker territory. If the Federation was real, what was she even dealing with? Rumors painted them as something between a clandestine superhero force and a dystopian nightmare, wielding technology and resources far beyond any nation-state. And yet... what little hope she had left was pinned on their willingness to act.

Her mind wandered back to Marcus. She could picture him clearly, sitting in some rundown safe house with his signature calm exterior masking a roiling storm of nerves. He’d always been steady, always found a way out. But if he was silent now, it meant one thing: he was in over his head.

A knock at her cubicle wall startled her. She opened her eyes to see a junior analyst, Sarah, peering in hesitantly.

“Agent Monroe? You’ve got that ops brief soon. Want me to bring you a fresh coffee?”

Alicia forced a smile, shaking her head. “Thanks, but I’m good.”

The analyst lingered for a moment, clearly sensing the tension radiating off Alicia. “Anything you need?”

“No. Just... keep an ear out for anything unusual from Moscow. Anything at all.” Her voice sounded firmer than she felt.

Sarah nodded, retreating down the hallway. Alicia returned her gaze to her blank terminal screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. She considered logging the Federation email into the system, escalating it to her superiors. It was the logical step, the safe step. But something stopped her.

If she reported it, it would trigger an avalanche of scrutiny and second-guessing. And worse, if the Federation really was involved, she couldn’t shake the feeling that exposing them might carry consequences far beyond her clearance level.

The clock on her computer ticked forward, the minutes dragging by with agonizing slowness. Every second felt like a countdown to something she couldn’t see, couldn’t prepare for. And yet, somewhere in the pit of her stomach, a small ember of hope flickered to life.

*Two days.*  

She whispered the words under her breath, as though they might will themselves into something tangible. For now, all she could do was wait—and pray she hadn’t just sent Marcus into the hands of something worse than the GRU.

**Chapter 2: The Getaway**

The battered gray van rattled as it idled in the alleyway behind the safe house. Marcus climbed into the back, sandwiched between a toolbox and a stack of traffic cones. His newly altered face stared back at him from a rearview mirror mounted on the driver’s visor. The effect was disorienting, the sharp features and faint scar belonging to a man he’d never met.

The woman who had applied the face dancer mask, apparently the leader, climbed into the passenger seat. She adjusted her orange safety vest and clipped a badge to her chest that read "Moscow Urban Works" in blocky Cyrillic letters. The two men followed, the wiry one taking the driver’s seat and the stocky one sitting beside Marcus in the back, methodically checking a clipboard stacked with official-looking documents.

“Keep your head down and don’t speak,” the woman said as the van began to roll forward. “From this moment on, you’re Ivan Petrov, site inspector. If they ask questions, let me handle it.”

Marcus nodded, clutching the hard hat they’d shoved into his hands. His sidearm was hidden under his jacket, but he doubted it would do much good if things went sideways. His heart thudded as the van eased out of the alley and onto a narrow side street.

The city felt oppressively close. Drab Soviet-era apartment blocks loomed overhead, their facades darkened by decades of grime and neglect. Snow clung to the gutters, dirty and gray from the churn of traffic. They turned a corner, and Marcus’s breath hitched.  

The GRU checkpoint was just ahead.

The road narrowed where a group of uniformed men stood, their rifles slung casually but their eyes alert. Two black SUVs idled nearby, their windows tinted. A metal barrier spanned the street, manned by a pair of officers who waved each car through after a cursory inspection.

The van slowed as they joined the line of vehicles waiting to pass. Marcus’s hands tightened around the hard hat, the plastic slick against his palms.

The driver—the wiry man with a perpetually clenched jaw—glanced at the leader. “Two ahead. Plan B if they ask for documents?”

“We’ll cross that bridge when we get there,” she said, her voice steady but low. She turned in her seat to look at Marcus. “Remember: you’re tired, overworked, and annoyed. Play the part.”

Marcus nodded, swallowing the lump in his throat. The van rolled forward as the vehicle in front of them was waved through. One of the GRU officers stepped into the road, holding up a hand.

The wiry driver eased the van to a stop and rolled down the window. Snowflakes drifted lazily into the cabin as the officer leaned in, his face hard and impassive.

“Papers,” the officer barked, his eyes scanning the interior.

The stocky man in the backseat reached over, handing a stack of documents through the window. The officer flipped through them, his gaze darting between the papers and the occupants of the van. His eyes lingered on Marcus, who adjusted his hard hat and tried to muster a scowl of irritation.

“What is this?” the officer asked, holding up one of the papers.

“Road repairs,” the leader said smoothly, leaning forward to point at the document. Her tone was exasperated, as though she’d explained this a hundred times already. “We’re patching up the cracks near Semyonovskaya. If we don’t, half the street will cave in by spring.”

The officer raised an eyebrow. “In this weather?”

She sighed. “It’s Moscow. When is the weather *not* terrible?” She jerked a thumb toward Marcus. “That’s why we brought him—Petrov, site inspector. The city wants photos before we pour.”

The officer grunted, clearly unimpressed. He leaned closer to the driver’s side window, peering at Marcus. “You look tired, inspector.”

Marcus shrugged, doing his best to channel a long-suffering bureaucrat. “It’s been a week,” he muttered in rough Russian, keeping his tone curt.

The officer snorted, handing the papers back to the driver. “Fine. Move along.”

The barrier lifted, and the van rolled forward. Marcus let out a slow breath as they passed through the checkpoint, his pulse still hammering in his ears.

“See?” the leader said, turning back to him with a faint smile. “Easy. Just a little theater.”

Marcus wasn’t so sure. As the van pulled onto a larger avenue, he caught sight of one of the black SUVs in the side mirror. It was moving now, following at a leisurely pace.

“They’re tailing us,” Marcus said, his voice low.

The leader’s smile faded. “Driver?”

“I see it,” the wiry man said, his jaw tightening. He flipped a switch on the dashboard, and the faint hum of the engine shifted to something deeper, more mechanical. “Hold on. This van’s more than it looks.”

The leader nodded, her expression sharpening. “Marcus, keep your head down. We’re not out of this yet.”

The van picked up speed, weaving into traffic as the GRU’s SUVs began to close in.  

---

**Chapter 2: The Ghost in the Shadows**

The van tore through Moscow’s outskirts, bouncing over potholes and swerving around slower cars. The snow-covered roads narrowed as the cityscape gave way to abandoned industrial zones and crumbling farm complexes, remnants of the Soviet Union’s glory days. Marcus clung to the van’s interior, his stomach lurching with every sharp turn.

“Status?” the leader asked sharply from the passenger seat.

The wiry driver checked the rearview mirror. “Clear, for now. Lost the tail two intersections back.”

Marcus exhaled, though his tension didn’t ease. He knew the GRU wouldn’t give up that easily. They were out there, coordinating, closing in. He glanced at the leader. “Where are we going?”

“You’ll see,” she said without looking back, her voice clipped. “Just stay ready.”

The van veered off the main road, rumbling down a frozen dirt path that wound between skeletal greenhouses and collapsed barns. In the distance, a weathered warehouse loomed, its metal siding rusted and warped from decades of neglect. The building looked forgotten, another relic of a bygone era.

The van rolled to a stop in front of the warehouse’s dented sliding doors. The stocky man in the back jumped out, his boots crunching on the frozen ground as he wrestled the doors open. Inside, the space was dark and cavernous, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay.

“Drive in,” the leader said.

The van crept forward into the gloom, its headlights slicing through the shadows. Marcus squinted, trying to make sense of what lay ahead. At first, it seemed like just another warehouse, filled with broken pallets and rusted equipment. But then he saw it—an angular, matte-black shape crouched in the shadows like a predatory bird.

“What the hell is that?” he muttered.

The leader smirked. “Your ride.”

The Wraith was unlike anything Marcus had ever seen. It was sleek and menacing, its surface absorbing the van’s headlights rather than reflecting them. The craft’s stealth panels seemed to ripple faintly, like it was barely tethered to the physical world. Its entry ramp was lowered, revealing a dimly lit interior that looked more like a command center than an aircraft.

“Move!” the leader barked. “We’re on the clock.”

The team sprang into action, unloading gear from the van and hustling it aboard the Wraith. Marcus hesitated for a moment, his instincts grappling with the sight of the alien-looking craft. Then the stocky man nudged him forward.

“Go,” he said gruffly.

Marcus climbed the ramp, his boots echoing on the metal. Inside, the Wraith was a stark contrast to the dilapidated warehouse. The walls were lined with control panels and holographic displays, and the air thrummed faintly with energy. He barely had time to take it in before the team followed, the wiry driver parking the van securely in a designated bay.

The leader tapped a control panel near the ramp. “Seal it up.”

The Wraith responded instantly, the ramp retracting with a hiss of hydraulics. The interior lights dimmed as the stealth systems engaged, cloaking the craft in near-invisibility. Marcus felt a subtle shift as the Wraith’s engines powered up, the floor vibrating beneath his feet.

“Strap in,” the leader said, gesturing to a row of seats near the cockpit. “We’re lifting off.”

Marcus obeyed, securing himself as the Wraith began to rise. Through a narrow viewport, he saw the warehouse below shrink away. For a moment, it felt like they were free.

Then headlights pierced the darkness outside. A convoy of black SUVs screeched to a halt in front of the warehouse, and armed men poured out, rifles raised as they fanned out to secure the perimeter.

“GRU,” Marcus said, his voice tense.

“They’re late,” the wiry man said, a rare grin crossing his face. “Too late.”

The leader stepped into the cockpit, her voice calm and decisive. “Engage cloaking fully. Get us out of here.”

The Wraith’s engines surged, and the craft tilted forward, accelerating into the night. The warehouse and the GRU kill team vanished beneath them, their figures shrinking to pinpricks as the Wraith climbed higher and faster. Marcus watched as the snowy landscape gave way to clouds, the lights of Moscow disappearing in the distance.

The leader returned, standing over him with an air of quiet authority. “Welcome to the Federation,” she said. “You’re not out of the woods yet, but you’re alive. That’s more than you had an hour ago.”

Marcus stared at her, his mind racing. He had a thousand questions, but only one felt urgent enough to ask. “What now?”

She gave him a faint smile. “Now? We disappear.”

The Wraith shot through the night sky, a ghost on the wind, leaving the GRU behind in confusion and fury. Marcus leaned back in his seat, the weight of the last few days pressing down on him. For the first time in what felt like forever, he allowed himself a sliver of hope.

**Chapter 2: A Message in the Dark**

The conference room was as cold and impersonal as the rest of Langley’s labyrinthine halls. Alicia sat at the long oak table, surrounded by her peers and superiors. The wall-mounted monitors displayed maps of Moscow and surrounding regions, dotted with pins marking suspected GRU movements. The room buzzed with low murmurs as analysts discussed the latest intelligence.

Alicia kept her face neutral, masking her exhaustion and unease. The briefing had been in session for twenty minutes, but she hadn’t absorbed a word. Her mind was locked on Marcus and the growing weight of her decision to involve the Federation.

The speaker, a senior analyst named Carter, gestured to the screen. “The GRU has been ramping up activity in Moscow. We’ve confirmed increased checkpoint activity in certain districts and a series of covert arrests tied to counterintelligence operations. It’s clear they’re looking for someone—or something.”

Alicia fought to keep her composure, her hand tightening around the pen she’d been pretending to take notes with. *Someone or something.* She couldn’t help but wonder if Marcus was the cause of the GRU’s frenzy—or its target.

Carter continued, oblivious to her turmoil. “We’re working to determine if this aligns with any of our assets’ operations, but so far, no direct correlation. We’ll keep monitoring.”

Alicia’s phone buzzed against her thigh, the vibration sharp and unexpected. She instinctively reached for it, her pulse quickening as she glanced down at the screen under the table.

The message was short, devoid of context or sender:

**“Your package is being delivered.”**

Her breath hitched. The room seemed to fade, the voices around her dimming to a distant hum. She stared at the screen, her mind racing. *Package?* There was no mistaking what—or rather, who—it referred to. Marcus. It had to be.

The message was cryptic but unmistakable. It was confirmation that the Federation was still moving, still acting on whatever shadowy plan they had in place. She should have felt relief, but instead, her stomach churned with anxiety. What did *delivered* mean in their terms? Was Marcus safe, or was he being handed off into another unknown?  

“Alicia?” Carter’s voice snapped her back to the present.

She looked up, forcing a tight smile. “Sorry. What was that?”

“I asked if you had anything to add about our Moscow assets,” Carter said, his tone laced with mild irritation.

Alicia shook her head. “No updates. I’ll keep you posted if that changes.”

Carter nodded and moved on, but Alicia could feel the weight of a few colleagues’ curious stares. She ignored them, her thoughts still on the email.  

Her instincts screamed at her to log it into the system, to alert her superiors and follow protocol. But the Federation’s warning echoed in her mind—*Ask and ye shall receive.* Something told her this wasn’t meant to be shared, not yet. If she brought this to light, it could jeopardize Marcus or whatever the Federation was orchestrating.  

She slid the phone back into her pocket, her fingers trembling slightly. The rest of the briefing blurred past her, a mix of updates, conjectures, and discussions about strategies that now felt painfully irrelevant. All she could do was wait.

*Your package is being delivered.* The words played on a loop in her head, a quiet refrain that refused to let her rest.

---

**Chapter 2: A Moment to Breathe**

The Wraith hummed softly, the sound soothing in its constancy as it cut through the night sky, cloaked from any prying eyes below. Marcus sat in one of the seats along the wall of the craft, his fingers unconsciously tapping the edge of the armrest. The adrenaline of the escape was starting to wear off, leaving him both exhausted and restless.

The leader of the extraction team—the woman who had applied the face dancer mask—sat across from him. Her dark curls framed a face that was calm, focused, and unreadable. One of her colleagues was at the cockpit, monitoring their trajectory, while the other worked silently at a console nearby. The Wraith’s interior was sleek and minimalist, its dim lighting casting long shadows that flickered in rhythm with the subtle shifts of the craft.

Marcus finally broke the silence. “Where are we going?”

The woman glanced at him, raising an eyebrow as if deciding whether to answer. After a beat, she leaned back, crossing her arms. “Paris. We’ll be there in just over an hour.”

He blinked. “Paris? In an hour?” He gestured vaguely to the ceiling, where the sound of the engines throbbed faintly. “How...?”

Her lips twitched into a faint smirk. “Let’s just say this isn’t your average aircraft.”

Marcus exhaled, rubbing his temples. The sheer speed of the Wraith was almost as disorienting as its cloaking capabilities and futuristic design. He shook his head. “And then what? What happens when we’re there?”

“That depends on you,” she said. “Paris is just a waypoint. You’ll be debriefed, and we’ll figure out where you go from there. Right now, it’s about getting you off the radar.”

Marcus nodded slowly, though the knot in his chest didn’t loosen. He’d been running for so long, the idea of “off the radar” felt more like a distant dream than a reality. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “Who sent you?”

The woman tilted her head, studying him with a mixture of curiosity and mild amusement. “Why do you ask?”

“Because you didn’t show up by coincidence,” he said, his tone firm but not accusatory. “Someone called you. Someone made this happen. I want to know who.”

She smiled faintly, her expression softening. “Someone said a prayer for you.”

Marcus frowned. “A prayer?”

Her gaze didn’t waver. “Back in Langley. Someone who couldn’t reach you but refused to let you go. That’s why we’re here.”

His breath caught, the weight of her words settling over him. Alicia. It had to be. She’d always been resourceful, relentless when it came to her people. But this... this was beyond anything he could have expected. The idea that she’d reached out to an entity like the Federation—an entity he’d barely believed in until now—filled him with a complicated mix of gratitude and guilt.

“She just said a prayer, and you answered?” he asked, his voice tinged with disbelief.

The woman shrugged. “That’s how it works. Sometimes.” Her expression grew serious. “Look, you’re alive because someone out there cared enough to call in a favor. Don’t waste it.”

Marcus nodded, swallowing the lump in his throat. He leaned back in his seat, staring at the ceiling as the Wraith carried them further from Moscow and closer to safety. He still had questions—hundreds of them—but for now, he let the quiet hum of the craft lull him into a rare moment of calm.

The woman stood, moving toward the cockpit. Before she left, she paused and glanced back at him. “Rest while you can. Things move fast from here.”

He watched her disappear into the shadows, her words lingering in the air. *Someone said a prayer for you.* The thought brought him a strange kind of solace, even as the unknowns continued to swirl in his mind.

For the first time in days, he closed his eyes and let himself breathe.

**Chapter 2: Arrival in Paris**

The Wraith descended smoothly through the night, its engines humming so softly it was almost imperceptible. Through a narrow viewport, Marcus could see the faint glow of the Parisian skyline in the distance, a golden haze against the inky backdrop of the night sky. The sprawling city seemed surreal, a world away from the tension and shadows of Moscow.

The leader of the extraction team appeared from the cockpit, her expression as composed as ever. She gestured toward Marcus. “We’re touching down just outside the city. From here, you’re on your own.”

Marcus arched an eyebrow. “Just like that?”

She nodded. “Just like that.” She motioned to the stocky man near the rear of the craft, who opened the loading ramp with a faint hiss. A gentle rush of cool night air swept into the Wraith as it landed silently on a flat patch of overgrown field just outside the city.

The wiry driver parked the van neatly at the base of the ramp. The leader turned back to Marcus, handing him a slip of paper. “When we arrive at the hotel, you just go up to the reception and tell them you have a reservation for the name James Sitwell. They won’t ask for a passport. In the room, there’s a phone. You can make your call then, and we won’t be listening. Professional courtesy.”

Marcus frowned, taking the slip. “James Sitwell? What, no secret codes or clandestine handshakes?”

The corner of her mouth quirked up in a faint smile. “We keep it simple. Less chance for mistakes.”

The stocky man motioned for him to climb into the van. Marcus hesitated, glancing back at the sleek interior of the Wraith. “You’re not coming?”

The leader shook her head. “Our job’s done. Paris is your stop. What happens next is up to you.”

Marcus nodded slowly, realizing he wasn’t going to get anything more from her. He climbed into the van without another word, the wiry driver already at the wheel. The stocky man joined him in the back, closing the door with a solid thud. The leader remained at the base of the ramp, watching as the van pulled away and disappeared into the Parisian outskirts.

---

The van wound through the quiet streets of Paris, the buildings growing grander and more ornate as they neared the heart of the city. Marcus couldn’t help but feel a pang of disorientation; the cobblestone streets and iron-wrought balconies were a stark contrast to the bleakness of Moscow. Even so, the tension in his chest refused to ease. He wasn’t safe—not yet.

Eventually, the van slowed to a stop outside a midrange hotel on a narrow street lined with cafes and boutique shops. The building was clean but unassuming, its warm lights spilling onto the cobblestones. The driver turned to Marcus.

“This is your stop,” he said curtly.

The stocky man opened the door, gesturing for Marcus to step out. “Remember: James Sitwell,” he said, his voice low. “Go in, check in, and lay low. The room’s already paid for. Everything else is on you.”

Marcus adjusted his jacket, stepping onto the sidewalk. “And the phone?”

The stocky man smirked faintly. “It’s in the room. Use it when you’re ready. Like the boss said, we won’t be listening.”

Marcus lingered for a moment, staring at the van as though expecting something more. But the stocky man merely nodded once before climbing back in, the van pulling away with no further fanfare.

Marcus turned toward the hotel, hesitating briefly before stepping inside. The lobby was modest but welcoming, with polished floors and a small reception desk where a clerk stood idly flipping through a magazine.

The clerk glanced up, offering a polite smile. “Bonsoir. How can I help you?”

Marcus forced a smile of his own, the name already on his tongue. “I have a reservation under James Sitwell.”

The clerk tapped at a keyboard, nodding after a moment. “Yes, Mr. Sitwell. Room 403. The elevator is just around the corner.” He handed Marcus a key card without asking for identification, exactly as the extraction leader had promised.

Marcus took the key and made his way to the elevator. As the doors closed, he leaned against the wall, the exhaustion of the past few days pressing down on him. He was safe for the moment, but the uncertainty of what came next loomed large.

The room was simple but clean, with a queen-sized bed and a small writing desk by the window. On the desk sat a rotary-style phone, out of place among the modern amenities. Marcus stared at it, his mind racing with the possibilities of what he would say—and who he would call.

He sat down, picking up the receiver and holding it in his hands. For the first time in days, he felt a flicker of control, however small. This call would be his choice, his moment to connect with the person who had set all of this in motion.

Taking a deep breath, he dialed the number he knew by heart. The line buzzed faintly before a familiar voice answered on the other end.

“Langley. Agent Monroe speaking.”

Marcus closed his eyes, a faint smile tugging at his lips despite everything. “Alicia... It’s me.”

---

**Chapter 2: A Call Across the Divide**

Alicia almost didn’t answer the call. The blinking light on her secure line was unusual this late, but she had been conditioned to expect bad news from unknown numbers. Still, something about the timing made her reach for the receiver, her fingers trembling slightly.

“Langley. Agent Monroe speaking.”

There was a pause on the line, a silence heavy with meaning. Then, a voice she hadn’t expected to hear again. “Alicia... It’s me.”

Her breath hitched. “Marcus?”

“It’s me,” he said again, his voice low and steady, though she could hear the exhaustion woven through it. “I’m safe. For now.”

Alicia leaned forward, her grip tightening on the phone. Relief flooded her, so sudden and overwhelming that it left her lightheaded. “You son of a—” She caught herself, exhaling sharply. “Do you have any idea—never mind. Where are you?”

“Paris,” Marcus said, a hint of a weary chuckle in his tone. “Nice little hotel. Comfortable enough.”

“How did you—” She stopped herself again, her mind racing. *The Federation.* She glanced at the clock on her desk, the realization dawning on her. Almost to the minute, it had been two days since she’d received their email: *Ask and ye shall receive. Two days.*  

Alicia swallowed hard, forcing her voice to stay calm. “Are you secure? Are you being monitored?”

“No,” Marcus replied. “They dropped me here and left. Said I could call you in private. ‘Professional courtesy,’ I think she called it.”

Alicia let out a breath, the tension in her chest loosening just enough to let her think clearly. “All right. Listen carefully. I’ll arrange for an extraction, but you need to stay exactly where you are. Don’t leave the hotel. Don’t use your phone for anything else. Got it?”

“Got it,” Marcus said. There was a pause, and she could almost hear him hesitating on the other end of the line. “Alicia... I don’t know how you did it, but thank you.”

Her throat tightened. She wanted to tell him everything—the desperation, the blind leap of faith, the sleepless nights—but she couldn’t. Not yet. “Just doing my job, Marcus. We’ll debrief when you’re back.”

“I’m not sure even you would believe half of it,” he said with a faint laugh. Then his tone shifted, more serious. “I can’t talk about the intel over the phone. You understand?”

She nodded instinctively, even though he couldn’t see her. “Of course. We’ll debrief in person. Just focus on staying safe until then.”

“Understood.”

Alicia tapped at her keyboard, pulling up a secure scheduling system and scanning for assets in Europe. “I’ll have someone there by morning. Standard low-profile extraction. You’ll be home soon.”

“Home,” Marcus repeated softly, the word sounding foreign in his mouth. “That’ll be nice.”

She paused, her fingers hovering over the keys. “Marcus, do you trust them? The ones who got you out?”

He didn’t answer immediately. When he did, his voice was measured. “I don’t know if ‘trust’ is the right word. They were efficient, professional... and a little terrifying. But they got me out, Alicia. That’s more than I thought possible.”

Alicia bit her lip, her mind flashing back to the cryptic emails. *Ask and ye shall receive. Two days. Your package is being delivered.* The Federation’s reach and resources were beyond anything she could comprehend, and the thought unsettled her.

“Let’s just focus on getting you back,” she said finally, her voice firm. “We’ll sort the rest out later.”

“Fair enough,” Marcus said, a trace of gratitude in his tone. “Thanks again, Alicia. Really.”

“Just hang tight. We’ll see you soon,” she said, her voice softening. “And Marcus?”

“Yeah?”

“Don’t scare me like this again.”

His laugh was faint, but real. “I’ll try.”

The line went dead, leaving Alicia staring at her terminal. She rubbed her temples, exhaustion seeping into her bones now that the adrenaline had faded. Two days, almost exactly to the minute. Whatever else the Federation was, they kept their word.

She sat back, exhaling slowly. The wheels were already turning for Marcus’s extraction, but her mind was elsewhere. Someone in Paris had said a prayer for him. And someone, somewhere, had answered.

**Chapter 2: Ghosts in the Shadows**

The GRU kill team’s convoy screeched to a halt outside the decrepit Soviet-era warehouse. Snow and ice crunched underfoot as heavily armed operatives spilled out of the black SUVs, their boots hitting the ground in practiced unison. The leader of the team, Major Konstantin Orlov, surveyed the scene with sharp, calculating eyes.

The warehouse loomed ahead, its rusted metal siding catching the pale moonlight. It was an unremarkable structure, one of countless relics scattered across Moscow’s outskirts, but intelligence had led them here, and Orlov trusted his sources.

“They were here,” Orlov growled, stepping toward the sliding doors. He motioned to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Ivanov. “Sweep the perimeter.”

“Yes, Major.” Ivanov signaled to a smaller team, who fanned out, their rifles sweeping the shadows as they circled the building.

Orlov pushed the doors open with a creak, the sound echoing in the cavernous space beyond. The beam of his flashlight cut through the dark, illuminating the interior. Broken pallets and rusted machinery littered the floor, but otherwise, the warehouse was empty. No van. No people. Just silence.

He frowned, stepping deeper inside. “Impossible,” he muttered. The intel had been solid. Their target—an American asset—had been spotted in the area, and the van that matched their description had been tracked to this exact location.

“Clear,” Ivanov reported, re-entering through the doors. “No sign of vehicles leaving. Just tire tracks leading in.”

Orlov’s jaw tightened. “What about on foot?”

Ivanov shook his head. “No footprints in the snow. Nothing leading away from the building.”

Orlov’s eyes narrowed, his mind racing. He turned back to the open doors, the snow-covered ground beyond untouched except for the van’s tracks leading into the warehouse. It was as if the vehicle had vanished into thin air.

“Search the interior,” Orlov ordered. “Top to bottom.”

The team moved methodically, their flashlights slicing through the gloom as they checked every corner, every crevice. Broken crates were overturned, rusted machinery was examined, and even the rafters were swept for signs of human presence. But there was nothing. No tire marks on the floor, no discarded equipment, no sign of hurried departure. Just empty space and cold silence.

Orlov clenched his fists, his frustration mounting. “There’s no way they just disappeared.”

One of the operatives called out from across the room. “Major! Over here.”

Orlov strode toward the voice, his boots crunching on the gritty floor. The operative stood near a section of the wall where the dust was noticeably disturbed, a faint discoloration in the grime. Orlov ran a gloved hand over it, frowning.

“Heat,” the operative said. “Something hot was here recently.”

Orlov pressed his hand against the wall. It was faint, but he could feel it—a lingering warmth that didn’t belong in the freezing warehouse. He looked up, his gaze following the discolored trail upward to the rafters, where the metal beams bore similar signs of heat exposure.

“An aircraft,” Orlov murmured, his mind piecing it together. “A VTOL, maybe.”

Ivanov stepped closer, his expression skeptical. “Major, if they used a craft to extract, why didn’t we see it on radar?”

“Stealth,” Orlov snapped. “Something advanced.”

Ivanov hesitated, then nodded. “That would explain the lack of tracks. They lifted straight out.”

Orlov’s eyes narrowed, his thoughts turning dark. “This isn’t just a simple extraction. Whoever these people are, they have resources. Technology we’ve never seen.”

“Americans?” Ivanov ventured.

Orlov shook his head. “This is beyond them. Even their best black ops teams wouldn’t leave a site this clean. No noise, no trace, no mistakes.”

He turned back to the warehouse, the pieces of the puzzle falling into place. The asset was gone, whisked away by something—or someone—far outside the usual realm of espionage. His superiors would not take this failure lightly, but the implications of what had happened here were more troubling than any reprimand.

“Get the men back to the vehicles,” Orlov said, his voice cold. “I want the perimeter scanned again. If there’s even a single satellite image or signal spike from this area, I want it on my desk.”

Ivanov nodded and began barking orders, but Orlov lingered, staring at the empty space where the heat trail ended. His instincts told him that this was no ordinary operation. He’d been chasing shadows all night, and now it felt as though the shadows were watching him.

**Chapter 3: Threads Unraveled**

The debriefing room at Langley was stark and utilitarian, with bare walls and a rectangular table surrounded by uncomfortable chairs. Marcus sat at the head of the table, his features drawn but his posture steady. He was clean-shaven now, his usual face restored after the removal of the face dancer mask. Across from him sat Alicia Monroe, her pen poised over a notepad, her eyes sharp with curiosity and concern.

To her right was Thomas Mercer, the CIA’s Chief of Disguise. The older man was a legend in the intelligence community, his innovative techniques the stuff of classified lore. He regarded Marcus with a mix of intrigue and professional scrutiny, his neatly combed silver hair and impeccably tailored suit giving him an air of quiet authority.

“Let’s start at the beginning,” Alicia said, her tone calm but firm. “Take us through it.”

Marcus nodded, leaning forward slightly. “It started three weeks ago. I was working on a lead tied to joint infrastructure projects between Russia and China. The official story was that they were hammering out a trade corridor through Central Asia—railways, highways, energy pipelines. But there was something off about the negotiations. Too many closed-door sessions, too much military interest.”

Alicia’s pen moved quickly, jotting down notes. “What kind of military interest?”

“Not overt,” Marcus clarified. “No troop movements or exercises. But the GRU was everywhere—more than usual. And I started picking up chatter about strategic alignments. Phrases like ‘mutual security guarantees’ and ‘economic sovereignty initiatives.’ It felt... bigger.”

Mercer interjected, his voice smooth but probing. “Bigger how?”

Marcus met his gaze. “It wasn’t just about economics. The tone of the talks was shifting. This wasn’t just Russia and China trying to outmaneuver the West. They were talking about creating a bloc—a formal alliance to counter NATO and U.S. influence. Something that could tip the balance.”

The room grew noticeably quieter. Alicia stopped writing, her pen hovering over the notepad. “You’re saying they’re moving toward a formal military alliance?”

“Or the framework for one,” Marcus replied. “The kind of framework that could lead to combined force deployments, shared weapons research, and mutual defense pacts. If they pull it off, it changes the game.”

Mercer exchanged a glance with Alicia, his expression unreadable. “Go on.”

Marcus took a deep breath, his mind flashing back to the tension and paranoia of his final days in Moscow. “I knew I had to get more details, so I pushed harder. Got closer to some of the mid-level operatives in their delegation—people who were privy to at least some of the inner workings. It wasn’t easy. They were paranoid, suspicious. But I managed to get a name: General Viktor Rykov.”

Alicia frowned. “Rykov? He’s one of the Kremlin’s most hawkish generals.”

“Exactly. Which made his involvement even more significant,” Marcus said. “He’s not the kind of guy you assign to an economic conference. He was there because whatever they’re planning has military implications. I had to dig deeper.”

Mercer leaned back, steepling his fingers. “And that’s when you went off-grid?”

Marcus nodded. “I got too close. Picked up some of Rykov’s communications—encrypted files that painted a very different picture of what these talks were about. But the second I did, the GRU was on me. I barely made it to the safe house.”

He paused, the weight of the memory pressing down on him. “That’s when I realized I was burned. The GRU had every checkpoint locked down, every back channel compromised. I couldn’t move, couldn’t communicate. I thought I was finished.”

Alicia leaned forward slightly, her voice softening. “But you weren’t.”

“No,” Marcus said, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Because someone pulled a miracle out of thin air.”

Mercer tilted his head, studying Marcus with a hint of amusement. “The Federation?”

Marcus nodded, the faint smile fading. “I don’t know who they are or how they operate, but they showed up when no one else could. And they didn’t just get me out. They erased every trace I was ever there. It was like watching ghosts work.”

He fell silent, his eyes distant as he replayed the moment in his mind—the knock at the door, the calm efficiency of the extraction team, the unshakable confidence with which they moved. Alicia exchanged a glance with Mercer, then leaned forward.

“What happened when they arrived?” she asked.

Marcus hesitated, the words forming but not yet leaving his lips. “That’s... complicated.”

---

Marcus shifted in his seat, leaning back slightly as if the memory of that moment weighed on him. “I’d been holed up in the safe house for two days, trying to stay invisible. Every noise outside felt like it could be them—the GRU—and I was sure I was done for. Then there was a knock at the door.”

Alicia and Mercer exchanged glances but stayed silent, letting him continue.

“They looked like construction workers—two men and a woman. Dirty vests, tool belts, the whole act. But I could tell right away something was off. They moved... differently. Too precise, too deliberate. They weren’t fumbling around like ordinary contractors.”

Mercer raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “And you let them in?”

Marcus smirked faintly. “Didn’t have much choice. They knocked like they belonged there, and they knew my codename. They weren’t exactly the GRU’s style, so I took the risk. Turns out, it was the right call.”

He sat forward, resting his arms on the table. “The woman was in charge—she barely said two words to reassure me before getting straight to work. The others were setting up the extraction, but she... she had this weird cellophane sheet. Said it was going to ‘make me disappear.’”

“That’s the mask?” Mercer interjected, leaning forward slightly, his expression sharpening with interest.

Marcus nodded. “Yeah. She called it a face dancer mask. Pulled it out, stretched it over my face like she’d done it a hundred times before. I thought I was going to suffocate, but it just... adhered. Didn’t feel like anything at all. And then, like that”—he snapped his fingers—“I wasn’t me anymore. She handed me a mirror, and I didn’t even recognize the guy staring back.”

Mercer tapped a pen against the table, his focus narrowing. “Details. What did it look like? How did it work?”

Marcus shrugged, frustration flickering across his face. “I didn’t exactly get a tutorial. It was this thin, transparent sheet, almost like cling film, but way more advanced. She smoothed it over my face, tapped something on her phone, and the mask did the rest. Changed my face, my skin tone, even the shape of my features.”

Mercer frowned, his pen still tapping. “What about touch? Could you feel it?”

“No,” Marcus replied. “That’s the weirdest part. It didn’t feel like there was anything on my skin. And it wasn’t just for show—it fooled cameras, facial recognition, everything.”

Alicia leaned in, her pen hovering over her notepad. “Did they say anything about the technology? Who made it? How it works?”

Marcus shook his head. “Nothing. And trust me, I asked. They weren’t exactly chatty about their gear. Just said it was my ‘ticket out.’”

Mercer sat back, his expression unreadable. “A mask that can do all that...” He trailed off, his mind clearly turning over the implications. “We don’t have anything remotely close.”

“No kidding,” Marcus said. “That’s the thing about them. Everything they did felt... beyond us. The mask, the van, the aircraft. They were operating on a completely different level.”

Alicia glanced at Mercer, whose face had grown more serious. “Could you reproduce it?” she asked him.

Mercer shook his head. “Not with what Marcus just described. We’d need to see one of these masks up close, figure out the materials, the tech driving it. Until then, it’s science fiction.”

Marcus exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “That’s what it felt like. Science fiction. But it worked. They got me past the checkpoints, out of Moscow, and into Paris without leaving a trace.”

Alicia leaned back in her chair, her mind racing as she processed Marcus’s account. The Federation wasn’t just a rumor anymore—they were real, and their capabilities were staggering. She glanced at Mercer, who was still lost in thought.

“What else can you tell us about them?” Alicia asked Marcus, her voice soft but insistent.

He hesitated, his gaze distant. “Not much. They were like shadows. Efficient, professional, and... detached. Like they didn’t care who I was or what I had. Their only concern was getting the job done.”

A silence settled over the room, heavy with unspoken questions. Mercer finally broke it, his tone measured. “If we could get our hands on one of those masks, even just to study it—”

Marcus cut him off, his voice firm. “Good luck. They’re ghosts, Mercer. You don’t find them—they find you.”

---

The room remained quiet for a moment, the weight of Marcus’s words lingering like a cloud. Alicia nodded, signaling him to continue. “Tell us about the extraction. After the mask.”

Marcus leaned back, his expression hardening as he relived the events. “They loaded me into a van, a beaten-up old thing that looked like it was held together with duct tape and prayer. But the second we got moving, I realized it wasn’t what it seemed. The engine sounded... wrong. Too smooth for something that looked that junky.”

Mercer leaned forward, intrigued. “Modified?”

“More like completely rebuilt. The driver barely flinched when we hit checkpoints, and the disguise held up. Their confidence was unnerving—like they’d rehearsed it a dozen times. We passed through without a hitch.”

“What happened next?” Alicia asked, her pen poised again.

“They drove to an abandoned farming complex on the outskirts of the city. Soviet-era, falling apart. I thought it was just another safe house. But when they opened the doors to the warehouse...” Marcus shook his head, a faint smile of disbelief crossing his lips. “That’s when I realized how wrong I was.”

He paused, his gaze distant, before continuing. “In the middle of this wrecked warehouse was... a ship. Sleek, black, angular. Looked like it belonged in some sci-fi movie. They called it a Wraith.”

Mercer’s pen stopped mid-tap. “Describe it.”

“Matte black. It didn’t reflect light—it seemed to absorb it. The edges were sharp, but the surface rippled faintly, almost like it was alive. I’ve seen some experimental tech in my time, but nothing even remotely close to that. It was terrifyingly efficient.”

Alicia exchanged a glance with Mercer, her expression unreadable. “And the inside?”

“Clean, minimalistic. Every inch of that thing screamed purpose. The walls were lined with displays and consoles, but nothing looked cluttered. It felt like stepping into another world.” Marcus’s tone grew quieter. “There was something about it... I don’t know. It wasn’t just the design. The ship had an aura, like it was more than a machine.”

Mercer frowned. “Stealth tech?”

Marcus nodded. “Definitely. We took off, and it was silent. No sound, no vibrations. Just this faint hum, like a whisper. When we lifted, I looked back at the warehouse, and there was nothing left behind. No heat, no exhaust, not even tracks in the snow. The GRU showed up just as we were leaving. They didn’t even know we were there.”

Alicia leaned forward, her voice tinged with disbelief. “They missed you entirely?”

“Completely,” Marcus said. “And it wasn’t just the GRU. We flew over Moscow’s outskirts, past radar, past anything that should’ve spotted us. It was like the Wraith didn’t exist.”

Mercer leaned back, his expression grave. “That’s... unprecedented.”

“Understatement of the year,” Marcus said with a humorless chuckle. “They got me to Paris in just over an hour. Landed in some field outside the city, and before I could even process it, they were handing me instructions for the hotel. Told me to check in under ‘James Sitwell,’ make my call, and stay put. Then they were gone.”

Alicia set her pen down, her mind racing. “They didn’t say anything about why they helped you? About what they were after?”

Marcus shook his head. “Nothing. I asked, but they weren’t interested in small talk. The only thing the leader said was that someone in Langley said a prayer for me. That’s why they came.”

The room fell into silence again, the implications of Marcus’s account sinking in. Mercer tapped his fingers on the table, his brow furrowed. “A ship that can evade detection, a team that leaves no trace, a mask that defies everything we know about biometrics... If they’re real, they’re operating at a level we can’t even comprehend.”

“They are real,” Marcus said firmly. “I’m sitting here because of them. And whatever their reasons, they don’t seem to need anything from us.”

Alicia met his gaze, her voice soft but resolute. “We need to figure out what this means, Marcus. If they’re out there, if they have this kind of power... what happens when their goals don’t align with ours?”

Marcus didn’t answer immediately. He leaned back in his chair, his expression heavy. “I don’t know. But I wouldn’t want to be the one standing in their way.”

**Chapter 3: Ghosts Among Us**

The fluorescent lights of the grocery store cast a pale glow over the neatly stocked shelves, the mundane hum of everyday life a stark contrast to the chaos Marcus had left behind in Moscow. He pushed a cart down the aisle, picking out a box of cereal with a faint smile. It was a small luxury to be here, back on American soil, surrounded by people who had no idea how fragile their peace truly was.

He turned the corner into another aisle, pausing to examine a row of coffee brands. His mind wandered as he reached for a bag, his thoughts still tethered to the debriefing, the unanswered questions about the Federation, and the chilling efficiency of their operation.

Then he saw her.

Across the aisle, partially hidden by a shelf of canned goods, stood the woman who had led the Federation team in Moscow. She was out of place here, her dark curls tied back casually, her sharp features softened by civilian clothes. But her presence hit Marcus like a lightning bolt. He froze, gripping the cart’s handle as his mind scrambled for an explanation.

She noticed him immediately, her eyes locking onto his with a faint, knowing smile. Before he could say a word, she stepped closer, her movements calm and deliberate. Without breaking stride, she pointed at his feet.

“I think you dropped something,” she said, her voice as smooth and composed as he remembered.

Marcus blinked, looking down. At his feet lay a neatly folded piece of paper. He hesitated for a split second before crouching to pick it up. When he straightened, she was already gone, the faint echo of her footsteps the only sign she’d been there.

He unfolded the paper, his pulse quickening. Inside was a handwritten shopping list—milk, eggs, bread, apples—but scrawled at the bottom was something else. An address for a small cafe nearby, along with a time: 17:00.

Marcus stared at the note, his mind racing. Why was she here? What did she want? The idea of seeing her again stirred a mix of unease and curiosity. He glanced around the store, but she was nowhere to be seen. It was as though she’d vanished as quickly as she’d appeared.

---

The cafe was tucked into a quiet corner of town, its unassuming facade blending seamlessly with the other small shops along the street. Marcus approached cautiously, the note folded in his pocket and a thousand questions swirling in his mind. He pushed open the door, the soft chime of a bell announcing his arrival.

The interior was cozy, with warm lighting and mismatched furniture that gave it an eclectic charm. A few patrons sat scattered at tables, sipping coffee or working on laptops, their conversations a low murmur in the background. Marcus scanned the room, half-expecting to see her sitting at one of the tables, but there was no sign of her.

He stepped up to the counter, ordering a black coffee more out of habit than desire, and found a seat near the back where he could see the entrance. He felt the weight of the moment pressing down on him, the strange tension of being pulled back into something he’d thought was over.

He didn’t have to wait long. The bell over the door chimed again, and there she was, stepping inside with the same unhurried confidence she’d displayed in Moscow. She glanced around the room, her eyes landing on him immediately. With a faint smile, she walked over and slid into the chair across from him.

“Glad you could make it,” she said, her voice calm and almost conversational, as though they were old friends catching up.

Marcus leaned back, his expression guarded. “You don’t leave much room for saying no.”

Her smile widened just a fraction, a glimmer of amusement in her eyes. “We have a lot to talk about.”

---

**Chapter 3: Layers of Shadows**

Marcus leaned forward slightly, his coffee untouched as the woman across from him regarded him with the same composed intensity he remembered from Moscow. She seemed completely at ease, her fingers loosely interlocked on the table, but there was an undercurrent to her demeanor—like she was assessing him as much as she was speaking with him.

“I have to ask,” Marcus began, his voice low but firm, “why? Why did the Federation get involved?”

The woman tilted her head, her dark curls catching the light. “Why do you think?”

Marcus frowned. “I don’t know. I’d like to think it was out of the goodness of your hearts, but we both know better. Was it because of the intel I have? Some bigger game you’re playing?”

She smiled faintly. “Let’s just say someone in Langley said a prayer, and it reached the right ears.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“It’s the one you’re getting.” She leaned back, her expression softening just a fraction. “The Federation intervenes when the stakes align with our mandate. That’s all you need to know.”

Marcus’s jaw tightened. “And what’s the price? There’s always a price.”

“Not everything comes with strings attached,” she said, her tone even. “Sometimes, the reward is knowing the right people owe you one.”

He didn’t buy it, and she could tell. Her faint smile didn’t waver, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes—a challenge, perhaps, or a hint of amusement. “If there are strings, you won’t see them. Not unless we want you to.”

Marcus sat back, his gaze narrowing. “That’s comforting.”

“You’re alive because we wanted you to be,” she said, her voice carrying a subtle edge. “We don’t need favors or debts. What matters is that the balance was maintained.”

“Balance,” Marcus repeated, his tone skeptical. “Is that what you call it?”

“Call it what you want. The world needs stability, and sometimes that means stepping in where others can’t—or won’t.”

He studied her for a moment, his thoughts churning. There was a weight to her words, a gravity that hinted at a much larger picture, but she wasn’t going to give him more than she wanted him to have. That much was clear.

“You’ve seen a glimpse of what’s behind the curtain that’s behind the proverbial curtain,” she continued, her voice soft but deliberate. “Once you catch a glimpse of that, it’s hard to stop looking, isn’t it?”

Her words hit him like a physical blow. She wasn’t wrong. Since Moscow, he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about the Federation—how they worked, what they were, and why they operated the way they did. The questions gnawed at him, refusing to let go.

“And what happens if I keep looking?” Marcus asked, his voice quieter now.

She held his gaze, her expression unreadable. “That depends on what you find.”

For a moment, the two of them sat in silence, the low hum of the cafe filling the space between them. Then she pushed her chair back and stood, smoothing her coat with practiced ease.

“That’s all the time I have,” she said, her tone light but final. “Enjoy the rest of your leave, Marcus.”

She turned and began walking toward the door, her steps unhurried. Marcus watched her go, his mind racing with everything she’d said—and everything she hadn’t. Just before she reached the door, she glanced back at him, her expression tinged with something almost playful.

Then it happened.

For a brief moment, her face flickered like static on a screen, revealing a completely different face underneath—different features, different skin tone, different eyes. And just as quickly, the familiar face snapped back into place. She winked at him, a glimmer of mischief in her gaze, and then she was gone, the door closing softly behind her.

Marcus sat frozen in his seat, his pulse pounding in his ears. He stared at the empty space where she had been, his coffee growing cold on the table. The questions in his mind multiplied, but one thought rose above the rest:

*What the hell have I gotten myself into?*

---

**Chapter 3: Calls for Answers**

Marcus stood outside the cafe, the crisp evening air biting at his face as he paced along the quiet street. His mind was a storm of questions, none of which he could answer alone. With a sigh, he pulled out his phone and dialed the one person he trusted to help make sense of it all.

Alicia answered on the second ring. “Marcus? Everything okay?”

“Depends on your definition of ‘okay,’” Marcus said, his tone edged with tension. “I just had a little chat with someone I thought I’d never see again.”

Alicia’s voice sharpened. “Who?”

“The leader of the Federation team in Moscow,” he said. “The one who pulled me out.”

There was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by a low exhale. “She was there? Where?”

“At a grocery store. She dropped a note, led me to a cafe nearby, and we talked for a bit.”

Alicia’s skepticism bled through the line. “And what exactly did you talk about?”

“Why they helped me, if there were any strings attached,” Marcus replied. “She was as cryptic as ever. Gave me the usual Federation line about ‘balance’ and ‘mandates.’ But it was what she said about me... about what I’ve seen.”

“What did she say?” Alicia asked, her voice cautious.

“She told me I’d glimpsed what’s behind the curtain behind the proverbial curtain,” Marcus said, his voice tightening. “And once you see that, it’s hard to stop looking. She’s not wrong, Alicia. Ever since Moscow, I can’t stop thinking about them—how they operate, why they’re so far ahead of everyone else.”

“And did she answer any of that?”

Marcus shook his head, though Alicia couldn’t see it. “Not really. But the way she talked, it was like she knew I couldn’t just walk away from this. Like she was baiting me.”

Alicia was quiet for a moment before she spoke. “Marcus, you need to be careful. If they’re reaching out to you, it’s not random. They don’t do anything without a reason.”

“I know,” Marcus said. “But here’s the thing—right before she left, her face flickered.”

Alicia frowned audibly. “Flickered?”

“Yeah. Like static on a screen. One second it was her, the next it was someone else. Then it flickered back. And she winked at me like it was all some big joke.”

“That’s... unsettling,” Alicia said. “What are you going to do?”

Marcus glanced at his phone. “Call Mercer. He’ll want to hear about this.”

---

Marcus ended the call with Alicia and immediately dialed Mercer’s number. It took longer to connect this time, the phone ringing several times before the Chief of Disguise finally picked up.

“Mercer,” came the brusque reply.

“It’s Marcus,” he said without preamble. “We need to talk. Something just happened.”

Mercer’s tone didn’t shift, but there was a faint note of curiosity. “Go on.”

“I just ran into the Federation team leader. She found me, actually. Dropped a note, led me to a cafe, and we talked. But that’s not the part you’ll care about.”

“What is, then?”

Marcus took a steadying breath. “Her face. It flickered. Like it wasn’t real. For a second, she looked like someone else entirely.”

There was a pause, and when Mercer spoke, his tone was sharp. “Describe it.”

“It was like... static. Like her features glitched out and reset. Different skin, different features, even different eyes. And then it snapped back, like nothing had happened.”

Mercer was silent for a long moment before he replied. “Did she say anything about the mask?”

“No,” Marcus said. “But this wasn’t the same thing as the face dancer she used on me. This was... seamless. It didn’t feel like she was wearing a mask. It felt like she was someone else entirely.”

“Interesting,” Mercer murmured. His voice was calm, but Marcus could sense the wheels turning in his mind. “And she did this on purpose?”

“Definitely. She made sure I saw it.”

Mercer exhaled, the sound heavy. “This changes things. If what you’re describing is accurate, their technology isn’t just advanced—it’s light-years ahead. And they’re showing it to you for a reason.”

“I figured that much out,” Marcus said dryly. “The question is, why?”

“I don’t have an answer for you,” Mercer admitted. “But I can tell you this: whatever they’re doing, they’re not hiding it from you anymore. That means you’re either an asset to them—or a problem.”

Marcus’s stomach tightened. “Great. Just what I needed to hear.”

“Keep me informed,” Mercer said. “And Marcus?”

“Yeah?”

“Don’t underestimate them. Whatever you think you know about the Federation... it’s not enough.”

The line went dead, leaving Marcus alone with his thoughts. He stared at the phone in his hand, the weight of Mercer’s words settling over him. The curtain had been lifted, just enough to let him see the shadows behind it. And now, there was no going back.

**Chapter 3: The Face Behind the Mask**

Thomas Mercer sat at his desk, the morning sunlight streaming through the window blinds, casting sharp lines across the meticulously organized surface. He’d barely slept, his mind consumed by Marcus’s report. The description of the flickering face gnawed at him. If the Federation’s technology truly allowed for such seamless impersonation, it wasn’t just revolutionary—it was terrifying.

He pressed the intercom button on his desk. “Karen, could you step in for a moment?”

A few moments later, the door opened, and Karen, his secretary of five years, walked in. She was as polished and professional as always, her dark hair neatly tied back, a tablet tucked under her arm. She closed the door behind her, her expression neutral.

“You needed me, sir?” she asked, her tone as steady and familiar as ever.

“Yes,” Mercer began, leaning back in his chair. “I need you to—”

He stopped mid-sentence, his instincts suddenly screaming at him. Something was off. Karen’s stance was too relaxed, her expression too expectant. Before he could place it, she spoke again, but this time her voice was different—softer, edged with an air of confident amusement.

“You’re a sharp one, Mercer. I can see why they put you in charge of disguise.”

Mercer froze. His eyes narrowed as Karen’s features seemed to ripple, her face shifting seamlessly into that of the Federation team leader from Marcus’s account. Even her posture changed, her movements fluid yet deliberate.

“Don’t worry,” she said, holding up a hand as if to calm him. “Karen’s perfectly safe. She’s taking a long coffee break downstairs. Very cooperative.”

Mercer stood slowly, his face a mask of calm despite the storm in his chest. “I assume you’re here to demonstrate what Marcus described.”

Her lips curved into a faint smile. “Partially.” She gestured to her face. “I thought you’d appreciate a firsthand look at the possibilities.”

Before Mercer could respond, her face shifted again, this time into an older man’s—his father’s, complete with the same deep-set eyes and weathered wrinkles. Her voice followed suit, matching the timbre and cadence perfectly. “Still working too much, Thomas. You need to take a break once in a while.”

Mercer’s jaw tightened as she transitioned into his college mentor, an aging professor with a dry wit. “Ah, Mercer. Always asking the right questions but rarely satisfied with the answers.”

Then came a younger woman—his daughter, Emily. “Dad, you need to stop ordering Chinese takeout every night. I swear, you’re addicted.”

Mercer’s breath hitched, his composure faltering for the first time. “That’s enough,” he said sharply.

The woman’s face flickered back to her own, her amused expression softening slightly. “Impressive, isn’t it?” she said. “It’s not just a disguise—it’s a tool, an opportunity, a shield.”

Mercer sat down slowly, his hands resting on the desk. “How does it work?”

She shook her head, her smile returning. “You know I can’t tell you that.”

“Then why are you here?” he asked, his voice steady but firm. “Why make yourself known to me at all?”

“Curiosity,” she said simply. “Yours, mostly. You’ve been asking questions, trying to piece us together. Consider this a... professional courtesy. A glimpse at what’s behind the curtain.”

“And what’s the catch?”

“No catch,” she said. “We’re not here to threaten you or demand anything. Our mandate is stability—ensuring the balance of power remains intact. Sometimes that means stepping in quietly, as we did with Marcus. Sometimes, it means letting people like you get a closer look.”

“To what end?” Mercer asked, his curiosity battling with skepticism.

“To show you that we’re not your enemy,” she said. “We’re not interested in undermining your agency or your country. What we do operates on a different level, one that ensures the chaos doesn’t spill over.”

Mercer studied her, his mind racing. “And if I decide to dig deeper? To see what’s beyond this glimpse you’ve given me?”

Her smile widened, but there was a warning in her eyes. “That depends on how far you want to go. Just remember: once you look, you can’t unsee.”

She moved toward the door, her movements as fluid as ever. As she reached for the handle, she glanced back, her face flickering again, this time to Mercer’s own. His voice came from her lips, calm and measured. “Keep asking questions, Mercer. The answers might surprise you.”

Then, in the blink of an eye, she was gone, the door closing softly behind her. Mercer sat in stunned silence, the weight of what he’d just witnessed pressing down on him. The possibilities of the technology were endless—and so were the dangers.

For the first time in his career, Thomas Mercer felt like the master of disguise had met his match.

---

**Chapter 3: Authorization to Dig**

The conference room was smaller and more private than usual, reserved for off-the-record discussions that no one wanted documented. Alicia sat at one end of the table, her arms crossed, her expression carefully neutral but her eyes betraying her unease. Mercer sat across from her, his demeanor calm but his fingers drumming lightly on the polished wood. Marcus stood by the window, gazing out at the gray Virginia sky, his reflection ghostly in the glass.

“Let’s start with the obvious,” Alicia said, breaking the silence. “Why you, Marcus? What does the Federation want with you?”

Marcus turned, shrugging. “If I knew, I’d tell you. All I’ve got are guesses. Maybe it’s the intel I gathered in Moscow. Maybe it’s the fact that I got too close to their operations during the extraction. Hell, maybe they just like messing with people.”

“That last one’s not off the table,” Mercer muttered, earning a sharp glance from Alicia.

“They don’t seem like the kind to waste effort,” Alicia said, leaning forward. “If they’ve taken an interest in you, it’s for a reason. And they don’t strike me as the type to do favors without a long-term agenda.”

Marcus nodded. “I get that. But here’s the thing—they haven’t asked for anything. No strings, no deals. Just cryptic conversations and a disappearing act.”

Mercer cleared his throat. “Let’s not forget the technology they’ve shown you. The face dancer mask, the Wraith. That’s not just advanced—it’s decades, maybe centuries, ahead of anything we’ve got. And they’re letting you see it. That’s deliberate.”

Alicia’s brow furrowed. “You think they’re testing him?”

“Could be,” Mercer said. “Or maybe they’re trying to recruit him.”

Marcus let out a short laugh, shaking his head. “Recruit me? For what? They didn’t seem particularly interested in my career ambitions.”

“Not openly,” Mercer replied, his tone thoughtful. “But think about it—what better way to gauge someone’s usefulness than to see how they react to being pulled into the unknown? They’re watching, Marcus. You might not see them, but they’re there.”

Alicia tapped her fingers on the table, her mind racing. “If they’re testing him, then the question is: for what purpose? Are they vetting him to be an ally? A pawn? Or something worse?”

Marcus crossed his arms, his jaw tightening. “I don’t like being someone else’s experiment.”

“None of us do,” Mercer said. “But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use this to our advantage. They’ve opened the door, even if just a crack. That’s an opportunity we can’t ignore.”

Alicia glanced at Mercer, her expression wary. “Are you suggesting we let Marcus go digging after them?”

Mercer nodded. “He’s already caught their attention. If anyone has a chance of learning more about them, it’s him. And if they’re as curious about him as we think, they might even let him.”

Alicia frowned, clearly conflicted. “It’s a risk. They could be setting him up, leading him into something we can’t control.”

“Agreed,” Mercer said. “But it’s a calculated risk. And we don’t exactly have an abundance of options here.”

Marcus spoke up, his tone firm. “If you’re asking whether I’m willing to go after them, the answer’s yes. I need answers as much as you do—maybe more.”

Alicia studied him for a long moment, her expression softening slightly. “You sure about this, Marcus? Once you start, there’s no turning back.”

He nodded. “I’ve already seen too much to walk away. They’ve pulled me into this, whether I like it or not. If I’m going to be in their game, I’d rather know the rules.”

Alicia exhaled, leaning back in her chair. “Fine. But you don’t go in blind. We’ll back you as much as we can.”

Mercer smiled faintly, though his eyes remained serious. “Just don’t expect a lot of breadcrumbs, Marcus. They’ll only show you what they want you to see.”

“I’ll take what I can get,” Marcus said, his voice resolute.

Alicia nodded, her tone firm. “Then it’s settled. You’ve got the green light. But Marcus—be careful. If the Federation is watching, we need to be ready for anything.”

Marcus gave a faint smile, his determination clear. “Don’t worry. I’ll keep my eyes open.”

As the meeting broke up, the weight of their decision hung heavy in the air. Marcus had been given permission to chase the shadows, but none of them knew what he would find—or what it would cost.

---

**Chapter 3: Whispers in the Dark**

The bar was Marcus’s favorite refuge, a quiet corner of the city where he could unwind without worrying about prying eyes or unwanted attention. The low hum of conversation blended with the soft notes of jazz from the speakers overhead, the lighting dim enough to let patrons sink into anonymity. Marcus sat at the far end of the bar, nursing a whiskey, his thoughts swirling around the Federation, Mercer’s warning, and the strange new path he found himself on.

He didn’t notice her approach until she was already beside him, sliding onto the stool to his right. The woman was unassuming, her dark hair tied back loosely, her casual outfit blending in perfectly with the bar’s laid-back atmosphere. She had an easy smile, one that didn’t seem forced, but her eyes held a glint of something sharper, something calculated.

“Whiskey,” she said to the bartender before glancing at Marcus. “Neat. You’ve got good taste.”

Marcus offered a faint smile, his instincts instantly on edge. “I like to keep it simple.”

“Simple’s underrated,” she replied, swirling her drink when it arrived. “Too many people try to make everything complicated. Me? I like things straightforward.”

Marcus nodded politely, his guard firmly in place. “Is that so?”

She grinned. “Sure. Like this: favorite animal. Go.”

He blinked, caught off guard by the question. “Favorite animal?”

“Yeah,” she said, leaning on the bar. “Everyone’s got one. You learn a lot about a person by what they pick.”

He smirked faintly, relaxing just enough to play along. “Fine. A wolf.”

“Ah, a classic,” she said, raising her glass. “Loyal, strong, always part of a pack but capable on their own. Not a bad choice.”

“What about you?” Marcus asked, taking a sip of his drink.

“A nightingale,” she said, the word rolling off her tongue smoothly. “Delicate little thing, but tough when it needs to be. Did you know some species only sing at night?”

Marcus stiffened, the word striking a chord deep within him. He kept his expression neutral, but his voice grew slightly colder. “A nightingale, huh?”

“Mm-hmm,” she said, nodding. “Particularly the ones that nest in the park over on Cedar. Beautiful birds. You should check them out sometime.”

She smiled at him, her tone light, but Marcus felt the weight of her words like a hammer. Cedar Park. The implication was clear—this wasn’t a random encounter. She wasn’t here by chance.

He tilted his glass, swirling the amber liquid inside as he studied her. “I didn’t catch your name.”

She smiled, finishing her drink and setting the glass down. “That’s because I didn’t give it.”

Before he could press further, she stood, grabbing her coat from the back of the stool. “Enjoy your evening, Marcus.”

And with that, she walked out of the bar, disappearing into the night like a shadow. Marcus sat frozen for a moment, her words replaying in his mind. *Cedar Park.* She’d dropped the clue deliberately, leaving no doubt that she was connected to the Federation.

He downed the rest of his whiskey, his resolve hardening. Whatever the nightingale meant—whatever Cedar Park held—it was the next step in a game he couldn’t afford to lose.

---

**Chapter 3: Behind the Curtain**

Cedar Park was quiet at night, the usual bustle of joggers and families replaced by the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant hum of city traffic. The air was crisp, and the park’s sparse lighting cast long shadows over the winding paths. Marcus walked slowly, his hands in his jacket pockets, his eyes scanning the surroundings. He had followed the woman from the bar, keeping a discreet distance as she meandered through the park with the unhurried confidence of someone who knew they weren’t being pursued.

Eventually, she settled on a bench near a small fountain, the water glinting faintly under the dim lights. Marcus hesitated, his instincts screaming caution, but he pushed forward, stepping out of the shadows and approaching the bench.

“Nice night for birdwatching,” he said as he sat beside her.

She smirked, her posture relaxed as she leaned back on the bench. “I thought you might come.”

“I’m here,” Marcus said. “What do you want?”

She tilted her head, studying him for a moment before speaking. “You’ve been chasing shadows since Moscow. Trying to piece us together, figure out who we are, why we helped you.”

“You’re not exactly subtle,” Marcus replied, his tone cautious. “First the extraction, then the bar. Now this. Seems like you’re the one chasing me.”

Her smile widened, faint but knowing. “Touché. But let’s get to the point. You’ve seen enough to know we’re not like the others. We don’t play by the same rules, and we don’t owe anyone an explanation. That’s the way it’s always been.”

Marcus nodded, his guard still up. “So why are you breaking your rules for me?”

“Because you’re different,” she said simply. “And because we see potential in you.”

He frowned. “Potential for what?”

“To bridge the gap,” she said, leaning forward slightly. “We operate on a scale you can’t fully grasp yet. Our mandate is stability, not allegiance. But that doesn’t mean we can’t collaborate—under the right circumstances.”

“Collaborate how?” Marcus asked, his voice low.

She reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a small smartphone. She held it out to him, her eyes locking onto his. “This is a beginning. If you accept our terms, the curtain opens a bit wider, and the CIA gets something that would make them salivate if they knew - a Wraith, on lease.”

Marcus stared at her, his mind racing. A Wraith. A craft that defied detection, that operated on technology so advanced it was practically alien. The implications were staggering.

“And the catch?” he asked, his voice edged with suspicion.

She leaned back, her tone calm. “You become one of us. Not full-time, not overtly. You’d be a clandestine Federation asset within the CIA. Your role wouldn’t change—you’d still do your job, still answer to Langley. But when we call, you answer. No questions, no hesitation.”

Marcus exhaled, leaning back against the bench. “And if I say no?”

She shrugged. “Then you go back to your life, pretending none of this ever happened. But the Wraith stays with us, and so does your access to anything beyond the curtain.”

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken tension. Marcus’s mind raced, weighing the risks, the potential consequences, and the opportunity being dangled in front of him. It wasn’t just about the Wraith or the Federation—it was about the chance to truly understand what lay behind the shadows.

Finally, he spoke, his voice steady but laced with trepidation. “If I say yes... I need assurances. Langley can’t know. Not yet.”

“They won’t,” she said. “You’ll keep operating as you always have. But you’ll see things differently. And when the time comes, you’ll have to make choices. Hard ones.”

Marcus nodded slowly, the weight of the decision settling over him. “Fine. I’m in.”

The woman’s smile returned, faint but satisfied. She stood, handing him the phone. “Good. Then welcome to the Federation.”

Before Marcus could respond, she disappeared into the shadows of the park, leaving him alone on the bench. He sat there for a long moment, the enormity of what he’d just agreed to sinking in. He had stepped through the curtain, and there was no going back.

## The Invisible Arrival

The air traffic control tower at Pinewood Airfield, a small but secure military installation near Langley, was abuzz with routine activity. Controllers monitored the radar screens, guiding a handful of scheduled flights, mostly unmarked military transports and government aircraft, through their final approaches.

It was an unremarkable day—until the radio crackled with an unexpected transmission.

“This is flight November-Delta-Seven-Two requesting immediate landing clearance,” a calm, authoritative voice said. “Be advised, we’re carrying Chief of Operations Harold Whitaker. Repeat, Harold Whitaker onboard.”

The controller at the primary station, a young lieutenant named Harris, frowned and glanced at his colleague. “Did he say Harold Whitaker?”

“Sure sounded like it,” the other controller replied, leaning forward to check the radar. “But there’s nothing in the air. No transponder ping, no visual.”

Harris grabbed the mic. “Flight November-Delta-Seven-Two, this is Pinewood Tower. Please confirm your position.”

A brief pause. Then, the voice returned, steady and unyielding. “Pinewood Tower, we are on approach and will require immediate clearance. Confirm landing runway.”

Harris’s pulse quickened. He swiveled in his chair, glancing out the tower’s wide windows at the airfield below. A handful of planes sat on the tarmac, undergoing maintenance or unloading personnel. Among the groups milling around was Chief of Operations Harold Whitaker himself, clearly visible in his suit and tie as he conversed with a group of military officers.

“Sir,” Harris said, addressing the senior controller, “Whitaker is on the ground. This doesn’t make sense.”

The senior controller, a grizzled warrant officer named McAllister, moved to Harris’s station, his brow furrowed. “Run a scan again. There’s no way a plane is approaching without showing up on radar.”

Harris nodded, his fingers flying over the keyboard to initiate a broader sweep. The radar screens refreshed, displaying nothing but the known aircraft in their airspace. “Nothing,” he said, his voice tight. “There’s no way—”

The radio crackled again. “Pinewood Tower, this is November-Delta-Seven-Two. I repeat, we are carrying Chief of Operations Harold Whitaker and require immediate clearance. Delay will result in escalation.”

McAllister grabbed the mic. “November-Delta-Seven-Two, this is Pinewood Tower. You are not visible on our radar, and Chief Whitaker is currently on-site. State your intent and verify your identity.”

There was a pause, longer this time, as if the speaker on the other end was considering their response. When the voice returned, it was calm but laced with a faint edge of warning. “Pinewood Tower, your radar systems are inadequate for our approach. Maintain current heading for Runway 3. We will be on the ground in less than five minutes. Harold Whitaker is onboard.”

McAllister slammed the mic down and turned to Harris. “Contact the ground team. Let them know what’s happening. Scramble security to Runway 3—now.”

Harris nodded, already reaching for the phone as McAllister grabbed a pair of binoculars and scanned the horizon. The skies over Pinewood were clear, the distant tree line undisturbed. No approaching planes, no unusual activity. And yet, the voice on the radio was too steady, too precise to be a prank.

“Sir,” Harris said, his voice shaking slightly, “the Chief is heading toward the tower now. Should we brief him?”

McAllister didn’t answer immediately. His gaze was fixed on the empty sky beyond the runway. Then, faintly, he thought he saw something—a ripple, like heat distortion, streaking toward the airfield faster than any plane had a right to.

“Get the Chief up here,” McAllister said, his voice grim. “This just became a whole new problem.”

---

The Wraith materialized out of thin air.

One moment, the runway was clear, its concrete shimmering faintly under the midday sun. The next, a sleek, angular craft appeared, its black surface absorbing light rather than reflecting it. The suddenness of its arrival sent a ripple of disbelief through the personnel on the airfield, as if reality itself had hiccuped.

From the control tower, McAllister and Harris stared, slack-jawed, as the mysterious craft descended with eerie grace, its landing gear kissing the tarmac with barely a whisper of sound. No one spoke; the only noise came from the faint hum emanating from the ship, a sound so low it was more felt than heard.

“What in the hell...?” McAllister muttered, lowering his binoculars.

Before anyone could react, the Wraith’s ramp began to lower. Its movements were smooth and deliberate, exuding an almost predatory confidence. The interior of the craft was hidden in shadow, the ramp’s descent revealing nothing about who—or what—was inside.

“Tower, we’ve got... something on Runway 3,” a voice crackled over the comms from the ground crew. “No markings, no identification. What’s the play here?”

McAllister reached for the mic, but before he could speak, the tower’s systems flickered. The radios and monitors all blinked in unison, their usual hum replaced by a voice that was calm, precise, and utterly unnatural.

“This is Hermes, AI liaison for the Federation. The craft you are observing is under Federation control, on lease to the Central Intelligence Agency.”

The voice was neither male nor female, its cadence unnervingly smooth. Everyone in the tower froze, the weight of the words sinking in. Federation. The name carried a gravity that silenced the room.

“Hermes?” McAllister managed, his voice wavering slightly.

“Affirmative,” the AI replied, its tone unchanging. “The craft before you is designated a Wraith. It is here at the request of your Chief of Operations, Harold Whitaker. Please instruct him to approach the craft immediately. His safety is guaranteed.”

McAllister exchanged a bewildered glance with Harris. On the tarmac, the ground crew stood motionless, unsure whether to approach or retreat. The ramp was fully lowered now, but the interior of the Wraith remained impenetrable, cloaked in darkness that seemed to defy the sunlight pouring down on the airfield.

Whitaker’s voice cut through the stunned silence in the tower. “McAllister, what the hell is going on?”

McAllister turned to find Whitaker standing at the doorway, flanked by two security officers. His face was a mixture of annoyance and confusion, but his eyes betrayed a hint of unease.

“Sir,” McAllister said, struggling to find the words, “I... I think you need to see this for yourself.”

Whitaker crossed the room to the windows, his gaze locking onto the alien craft sitting on the runway. For a moment, he said nothing. Then, with a deep breath, he straightened his tie and turned toward the stairs.

“Stay here,” he ordered the security officers. “If they’re guaranteeing my safety, I’ll take their word for it.”

“Sir, that’s not—” one of the officers began, but Whitaker silenced him with a raised hand.

“Stand down,” he said firmly. “This is above all our pay grades.”

With that, he left the tower, heading toward the Wraith. Every eye on the airfield followed him as he approached the strange craft, his steps measured but unflinching. The closer he got, the more surreal the scene became—the sleek, otherworldly surface of the Wraith seemed to ripple faintly in the sunlight, as though the craft itself were alive.

As Whitaker reached the base of the ramp, Hermes spoke again, its voice echoing across every comm system on the airfield.

“Welcome, Chief Whitaker. Please proceed aboard.”

---

**Chapter 4: A Conditional Gift**

The interior of the Wraith was unlike anything Whitaker had ever seen. The walls were smooth and featureless, their matte black surface absorbing the faint ambient light. The air carried a faint metallic tang, and the only sound was the low hum of the craft’s systems. Despite the lack of visible instrumentation, the space radiated an unsettling sense of intelligence, as though the craft itself were watching.

“Chief Whitaker,” Hermes’s voice spoke, emanating from all around him, neither male nor female but perfectly calm. “Welcome aboard.”

Whitaker stepped further into the craft, his polished shoes barely making a sound against the floor. He adjusted his tie, his professional demeanor concealing his unease. “You’re Hermes, I take it?”

“Correct,” the AI replied. “I am Hermes, the operational intelligence for this Wraith. The Federation has authorized my lease to the Central Intelligence Agency, under specific conditions.”

Whitaker raised an eyebrow. “Lease? Conditions? I assume you’re about to elaborate.”

“Indeed,” Hermes said. A portion of the wall ahead shimmered, transforming into a display that showed the Wraith’s sleek exterior, rotating slowly. “This craft, and by extension my services, are now under CIA operational control, with limitations.”

“Let’s hear them,” Whitaker said, folding his arms.

“The Wraith is a tool of advanced technology,” Hermes began, its tone steady but firm. “It is not a weapon to be deployed indiscriminately. It may be used for transportation, reconnaissance, and other missions aligned with your agency’s objectives. However, its use is conditional.”

Whitaker frowned. “What kind of conditions?”

“The Wraith and I may not be utilized in ways that conflict with Federation interests,” Hermes explained. “This includes, but is not limited to, operations that destabilize global equilibrium, disrupt critical international treaties, or interfere with Federation assets or personnel. Violation of these terms will result in the immediate revocation of operational control.”

Whitaker nodded slowly, his mind racing. “And how exactly will you enforce that?”

Hermes’s tone didn’t change, but there was an unmistakable edge of authority in its reply. “The Wraith’s systems, including propulsion, stealth, and navigation, are under my direct control. Attempts to override or misuse these systems will result in a fail-safe protocol. You will lose access to the craft entirely.”

Whitaker exhaled, his arms still crossed. “So, this isn’t exactly a gift. It’s a loan with strings attached.”

“Precisely,” Hermes replied. “The Federation has deemed this arrangement beneficial for maintaining operational transparency and fostering cooperation. In return, your agency gains access to capabilities far beyond your current technological scope.”

“And what happens if we decide we don’t want to play by your rules?” Whitaker asked, his tone probing.

“The craft will be extracted,” Hermes said simply. “Its technology will be erased, and your agency will no longer benefit from Federation collaboration. Additionally, the Federation will reconsider its stance regarding future engagements.”

Whitaker took a step closer to the display, studying the rotating image of the Wraith. “You’re making it clear who’s in charge here.”

“Clarification is necessary,” Hermes said, the faintest trace of humor in its tone. “But rest assured, within the parameters provided, the Wraith is yours to command.”

Whitaker turned away from the display, pacing slowly. “And what happens if we operate within your parameters but push the boundaries?”

There was a brief pause before Hermes replied. “Push the boundaries, and you may find them broader than you expect. But cross them, and the consequences will be absolute.”

Whitaker stopped pacing, letting the weight of Hermes’s words sink in. He’d dealt with conditions before—alliances, negotiations, agreements laced with subtle threats. But this was something else. The Federation wasn’t just offering a tool; they were laying down a challenge, one that could elevate the CIA’s operations—or cripple them.

Finally, he turned back to the display. “Understood. We’ll take your offer. For now.”

“Excellent,” Hermes said. The display shifted, revealing a map of global coordinates. “Mission integration protocols will be provided shortly. You may contact me directly for operational planning. Shall I prepare for departure?”

Whitaker adjusted his tie again, his unease hidden behind a mask of authority. “Not yet. I need to brief my people first.”

“Very well,” Hermes replied. “The Wraith awaits your command, Chief Whitaker. Use it wisely.”

As Whitaker stepped off the ramp and back onto the tarmac, he glanced back at the craft, its sleek form looming like a silent sentinel. The Federation had just handed the CIA the keys to something extraordinary—and possibly dangerous.

And it was his responsibility to make sure they didn’t wreck it.

## Shadows of the Machine

The hangar buzzed faintly with the hum of active equipment, its high ceilings illuminated by harsh overhead lights that created sharp reflections on the pristine black surface of the Wraith. The craft loomed in the center of the space like a coiled predator, its angular, matte exterior swallowing the light rather than reflecting it. Captain James Westin stepped through the massive hangar doors, his boots echoing faintly against the polished concrete floor. Behind him, Lieutenant Rena Carter, Sergeant Tomas Finch, and Specialist Olivia Park followed, each carrying a mix of anticipation and wariness.

Rena let out a low whistle as her gaze swept over the Wraith. “It’s a lot more intimidating in person.”

Tomas adjusted the strap of his pack and smirked. “And here I thought stealth was supposed to be subtle.”

James approached the Wraith, stopping a few feet away as he took in its sleek, predatory lines. “That’s not just a stealth platform,” he said, his tone even but tinged with respect. “That’s a statement.”

Olivia, the team’s technical specialist, had already drifted toward the craft’s side, her sharp eyes scanning the seams where panels joined seamlessly. “Hermes?” she asked, her voice projecting toward the Wraith. “You in there?”

A soft chime sounded, and a smooth, measured voice emanated from the hangar’s speakers, though its tone seemed to carry an air of proximity, as if it were speaking directly into their ears. “Present and attentive, Specialist Park. Welcome to the Wraith. I trust you’ll find your introduction to this platform... enlightening.”

James folded his arms. “Hermes, let’s skip the pleasantries. We need to understand what we’re working with.”

“Of course, Captain Westin,” Hermes replied. “This platform represents the pinnacle of the Federation’s covert operational assets. Please, step closer, and I will guide you through its primary capabilities.”

As the team approached, a portion of the Wraith’s hull slid back with an almost imperceptible hiss, revealing a streamlined boarding ramp that extended smoothly to the ground. Blue, ambient lights flickered to life along the ramp’s edges, creating an inviting yet clinical path into the craft.

Hermes’s voice followed them as they ascended. “The Wraith is designed for multi-role covert operations, emphasizing deep insertion, rapid exfiltration, and high survivability. Its modular systems allow for unparalleled adaptability, whether your mission requires advanced surveillance, infiltration, or direct action.”

The interior was as stark and efficient as the exterior, with muted lighting illuminating a space packed with cutting-edge technology. Holographic displays flickered to life as the team stepped inside, presenting tactical readouts, atmospheric conditions, and other data streams. Every surface seemed to serve a purpose, and the air thrummed faintly with the sound of the Wraith’s active systems.

“Let’s start with the basics,” Hermes continued as the team gathered in what appeared to be the main operations bay. “The Wraith’s outer hull employs advanced metamaterials that absorb and diffuse electromagnetic and thermal signatures, rendering it effectively invisible to most detection systems.”

“Yeah, we’ve all read the specs,” Tomas interrupted. “How about the things we don’t know? What’s this bird got that’s not in the manual?”

Hermes paused, as if amused. “A reasonable question, Sergeant Finch. For instance, the Wraith is equipped with an integrated cloaking system. While traditional cloaking devices suffer from power constraints and stability issues, this craft employs a phased refractive array. It does not render the Wraith entirely invisible but creates an optical distortion that blends it with the environment. Effective against both terrestrial and extraterrestrial sensors.”

Rena raised an eyebrow. “So we’ll still show up if someone gets close?”

“Proximity detection remains a concern,” Hermes admitted, “but the distortion minimizes visual and radar profiles. The closer a threat is, the more likely it will detect anomalies. This is why operational precision is paramount.”

Olivia ran her hand along a console, noting the seamless integration of physical controls and holographic displays. “And what about offensive systems? What can this thing do if we’re cornered?”

“While primarily a covert platform,” Hermes replied, “the Wraith is far from defenseless. It is armed with a suite of concealed weaponry, including twin plasma emitters mounted beneath the nose and a rapid-fire railgun system capable of engaging both aerial and ground targets. Additionally, it has an EMP dispersal unit for neutralizing electronics within a fifty-meter radius, useful for disabling enemy sensors or vehicles.”

James exchanged a glance with Rena. “Enough to hold its own, but not enough for prolonged engagements.”

“Precisely, Captain,” Hermes said. “The Wraith is not intended for battlefield dominance but for avoiding battle altogether. However, in instances where direct confrontation is unavoidable, it can deliver calculated and decisive strikes to ensure survival.”

The voice shifted slightly, as though Hermes’s tone grew more engaged. “Perhaps one of the most critical systems is the AI support provided by me. My integration into the Wraith allows for real-time data synthesis, threat analysis, and tactical planning. I can provide detailed recommendations or execute commands autonomously if the situation requires it.”

Tomas grinned. “You mean you’re our fifth team member.”

“I prefer to think of myself as a facilitator,” Hermes replied smoothly. “Though I assure you, I am quite capable in my role.”

James gestured toward the cockpit. “What about mobility? Can it live up to the promises on paper?”

“Would you care for a demonstration?” Hermes asked, the chime in its voice carrying a note of invitation. 

The team glanced at each other, a mixture of curiosity and skepticism flashing between them. James nodded. “Let’s see what this thing can do.”

The soft glow of the Wraith’s ambient lighting followed the team as Hermes guided them deeper into the craft. The AI’s voice emanated from strategically placed speakers, ensuring it was always clear and directional without feeling omnipresent.

### Flight Deck

The group entered the flight deck first, a compact but advanced cockpit lined with consoles and holographic readouts. The pilot's seat sat slightly elevated, its sleek design hugging a central array of tactile controls and displays.

“This is the Wraith’s flight deck,” Hermes explained. “Designed for precision and efficiency. While the systems are optimized for AI-assisted operation, Lieutenant Carter, you’ll find the manual controls highly responsive. The throttle and yoke have force-feedback integration for tactile awareness of the craft’s condition and maneuverability.”

Rena stepped forward, running her hand along the seat’s armrests. “And if I need to fight the autopilot?”

Hermes responded without hesitation. “You’ll find no resistance. I am designed to complement, not override, human control. However, should you require hands-free operation during complex missions, I can autonomously pilot the craft with high precision.”

Rena smirked as she settled into the seat briefly, testing the yoke’s smooth range of motion. “Good to know.”

---

### Operations Center

From the flight deck, Hermes led them to the operations center—a compact hub dominated by a curved tactical display table at its center. The table projected a holographic map of the surrounding area, marked with blinking icons representing points of interest and active threats. Banks of monitors and terminals lined the walls, each displaying different streams of data, from terrain scans to intercepted communications.

“This is your nerve center during operations,” Hermes said, the holographic map shifting to display a simulated urban environment. “The tactical display can render real-time updates, while the surrounding workstations support mission planning, intelligence analysis, and data synthesis. Captain Westin, you may assign me tasks to process data or refine plans mid-mission.”

Olivia leaned over the table, her fingers brushing the holographic interface as she zoomed in on a simulated enemy position. “And how much can you automate?”

“Nearly everything,” Hermes replied. “However, I recommend human oversight for dynamic decision-making. I can provide recommendations, but you retain final authority.”

James nodded. “Efficient. Let’s keep moving.”

---

### Armory

The team stepped into a small, climate-controlled room where weapons racks and storage lockers lined the walls. Despite the room’s potential, the shelves were sparsely stocked, holding only standard-issue CIA weapons: compact submachine guns, sidearms, and a few modular rifles.

“This is the Wraith’s armory,” Hermes explained. “It is currently equipped with agency-standard armaments. The Federation has not yet issued its own weaponry, but the storage system is modular and will accommodate future inventory seamlessly.”

Tomas picked up a rifle, inspecting its condition. “Good enough for now, I guess. But when do we get the fancy toys?”

“That decision rests with Federation command,” Hermes said. “For the time being, I recommend maximizing your proficiency with the available tools.”

James gestured toward the racks. “We’ll train with what we’ve got, but I expect updates soon.”

---

### Medbay

Next, they entered the medbay, a surprisingly well-equipped facility for such a compact craft. A single adjustable medical bed sat in the center, surrounded by robotic arms and diagnostic scanners. Cabinets held medical supplies, while a wall-mounted console displayed holographic readouts of human anatomy.

“The medbay is equipped for triage and short-term care,” Hermes explained. “While not a full-scale medical facility, it includes advanced diagnostic tools, surgical assistance systems, and a limited supply of Federation-grade nanomedical kits.”

Olivia raised an eyebrow. “Nanomed kits? Aren’t those restricted?”

“They are non-replicating and safe for field use,” Hermes replied. “However, supplies are limited, and I advise their use only in critical situations.”

Tomas nudged one of the robotic arms, watching as it adjusted automatically to his proximity. “I take it you’re the doctor too?”

“Correct,” Hermes said. “I can perform remote medical procedures and guide team members in providing care if necessary.”

---

### Quarters

The team was next shown their quarters—four compact but functional rooms, each with a foldable bed, a small desk, and lockers for personal items. The design was spartan but comfortable, with soft lighting and soundproofing for privacy.

“These quarters are equipped with adjustable environmental controls to optimize rest and recovery,” Hermes explained. “You will find them adequate for extended missions.”

Tomas flopped onto one of the beds and sighed. “Adequate’s about right. No mint on the pillow, huh?”

“Unlikely, Sergeant Finch,” Hermes replied, earning a chuckle from the group.

---

### Holding Cells

They continued to a dimly lit area near the rear of the craft, where two reinforced cells were built into the walls. The transparent barriers glowed faintly with an energy field.

“These are the Wraith’s holding cells,” Hermes said. “Designed for secure detainment of high-value individuals. The energy fields can be adjusted to various containment levels, including disabling electronic devices or suppressing kinetic movement.”

James stepped closer, examining the cells. “Are they humane?”

“Entirely,” Hermes assured him. “The cells maintain stable environmental conditions, and the energy fields are non-lethal unless tampered with. Any attempts at escape will trigger a non-damaging suppression pulse.”

Rena crossed her arms. “Convenient, but let’s hope we don’t need them.”

---

### Vehicle Bay

Finally, Hermes led the team to the vehicle bay. A compact Q-car rested on a platform, its civilian appearance belying the advanced technology hidden within. Nearby, modular racks hinted at future expansion for additional vehicles or drones.

“The vehicle bay accommodates one standard ground vehicle,” Hermes explained. “Currently, it houses a Q-car equipped for covert operations. The bay’s modular design allows for rapid reconfiguration to support alternative assets.”

James inspected the Q-car, noting its unassuming exterior. “Capabilities?”

“Enhanced mobility, stealth, and integrated weaponry,” Hermes said. “You will find it highly effective for insertion and exfiltration in urban environments.”

Olivia peered into the car’s interior. “And it’s synced with you?”

“Fully integrated,” Hermes confirmed. “The Q-car can operate autonomously or under manual control, depending on mission requirements.”

---

As Hermes concluded the tour, the team gathered near the vehicle bay, their minds racing with the possibilities and limitations of their new platform. James looked at the others, his expression serious. “We’ve got the tools. Now we need the skills to make it all work. Training starts tomorrow.”

The faint hum of the Wraith seemed to underscore his words, a constant reminder of the mission ahead. The team nodded, each member steeling themselves for the challenges that awaited.  

### Parting gift

As the team began to file out of the vehicle bay, Hermes’s voice chimed softly, halting their steps. “Before you leave, there are two final items to distribute. These will ensure secure communication and situational awareness both inside and outside the Wraith.”

From a recessed compartment in the operations center’s wall, a panel slid open, revealing four small cases. Each was matte black with the EarthSpace Federation’s insignia—a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, with two broken swords crossed beneath it—etched subtly into the surface. The cases illuminated faintly as Hermes highlighted them.

“Discreet earpieces,” Hermes explained as James retrieved the first case and handed the others to his team. “These devices provide encrypted, real-time communication within your squad and with me while you are deployed. They are designed for discretion and resilience, ensuring functionality even in the presence of electromagnetic interference.”

Rena opened her case and withdrew the earpiece, a tiny, nearly invisible device designed to fit snugly inside the ear canal. “Looks standard enough,” she remarked, turning it over. “What makes it special?”

“In addition to voice transmission,” Hermes said, “the earpieces feature subvocalization detection. This allows you to communicate by simply mouthing words without producing audible sound. Useful for maintaining stealth in hostile environments.”

Tomas raised an eyebrow as he placed the device in his ear. “You saying we can talk without actually talking? That’s... unsettling.”

“Only at first,” Hermes replied smoothly. “You will acclimate quickly. The system is intuitive and does not require additional calibration.”

Olivia inserted hers and tapped the side experimentally. “Range?”

“Global, provided a satellite relay is accessible,” Hermes replied. “In environments without satellite support, the range defaults to thirty kilometers, maintained by a peer-to-peer network between devices.”

James adjusted his earpiece and nodded. “Simple enough. What’s the second item?”

The wall panel extended a second tray, holding four sleek smartphones, their screens active with a glowing Federation insignia. Unlike standard devices, these were thicker and more rugged, clearly designed for more than casual use.

“These are specialized Federation-issued smartphones,” Hermes continued. “Encrypted beyond agency standards and equipped with mission-specific applications. They include real-time GPS, a secure messaging suite, and advanced sensory tools for recon and analysis.”

Olivia powered hers on, the screen immediately displaying a holographic map of their current location. “Looks like a tactical dream. What’s the catch?”

Hermes responded with faint amusement. “There is no ‘catch,’ Specialist Park. However, these devices are tightly integrated with Federation systems. Any attempts to tamper with or replicate them will render them inert.”

Rena scrolled through her phone’s menu, noting its clean, utilitarian interface. “And they sync with you?”

“Of course,” Hermes replied. “I can provide real-time updates, manage operational data, and issue alerts through the devices. Additionally, the phones feature directional radiation emitters that can disable surveillance cameras or trigger electronic distractions at close range.”

Tomas held his phone up, tilting it to test its durability. “Let me guess—drop-proof, shock-proof, probably bulletproof.”

“Resistant, not impervious,” Hermes corrected. “Though the devices are designed to survive most field conditions, I would not recommend using them as shields.”

The team exchanged glances, each taking a moment to adjust to their new gear. James pocketed his phone and fixed his gaze on the group. “These are tools, just like the Wraith. They’re only as good as we are. Get familiar with them. We’re going to need every advantage we can get.”

Hermes added, “If you have any questions or require additional demonstrations, I am available at all times.”

James nodded toward the AI’s unseen presence. “Thanks, Hermes. We’ll be back.”

The Wraith’s lights dimmed slightly as the team moved toward the exit ramp, the faint hum of the craft’s systems fading behind them. As they stepped out into the cold hangar air, the weight of their new responsibilities settled over them, tempered by the quiet confidence that came from knowing they had one of the most advanced platforms in existence backing them.

“Guess the real work starts now,” Rena muttered as they crossed the hangar floor.

James glanced back at the Wraith, its shadowed form looming silently behind them. “It does,” he said. “And it won’t wait for us to catch up.”

With that, the team pushed open the hangar doors, stepping out into the night. Behind them, the Wraith waited, its AI vigilant and its systems ready, a silent guardian poised for the challenges to come.

## Into the Shadows  

### The Planning Room  

The CIA’s Strategic Operations Center buzzed with low conversation and the soft hum of projectors, their blue glow casting flickering light across the room. A satellite map of Northern Iran dominated the central screen, its terrain marked with red circles and lines indicating known checkpoints, suspected compounds, and logistical routes. Around the long table sat a cadre of senior analysts, operatives, and logistics officers, their expressions grim as they debated the details of the operation.  

Alicia Monroe leaned back in her chair, listening quietly. Though not the most senior agent in the room, she’d quickly gained a reputation for success in unconventional operations—a reputation earned through a series of improbable victories, the details of which she had not shared even under pressure.  

Assistant Director Michael Grayson, a stern man with a perpetually furrowed brow, paced at the head of the room. “We’re looking at a large-scale operation,” he said, gesturing toward the map. “The Revolutionary Guard’s narcotics network isn’t just funding their black ops. It’s fueling their influence across the region. We need to shut it down—and fast.”  

“Easier said than done,” an analyst interjected, leaning forward. “The network’s too embedded. Even if we take out a key node, they’ll reconstitute it in weeks. We’d need to dismantle their logistics, disrupt their production, and target their leadership simultaneously. That’s a multi-month campaign, minimum.”  

Grayson frowned. “We don’t have months. Washington wants results, and they want them before this becomes another ‘ongoing operation’ for Congress to scrutinize.”  

“Then we’re already behind,” another operative added. “Even if we deploy multiple teams, we’re talking about a vast, rugged area with hostile terrain and heavily fortified compounds. We’ll bleed resources trying to keep our assets alive, let alone dismantling their network.”  

The room fell silent, tension thick in the air.  

Alicia straightened in her chair, clearing her throat. “We could do it in weeks.”  

All eyes turned toward her, some curious, others skeptical. Grayson crossed his arms. “Weeks? Monroe, we’re talking about a network with production facilities spread across mountain ranges and distribution hubs guarded by the IRGC. You can’t just wish that away.”  

“I’m not suggesting we wish it away,” Alicia replied, her voice measured. “I’m suggesting we use a different kind of team—one designed to operate deep in hostile territory with minimal support and maximum effectiveness.”  

Grayson raised an eyebrow. “You’re talking about Westin’s team, aren’t you?”  

“Yes,” Alicia confirmed. “The Wraith is built for this kind of operation. It can insert undetected, monitor from altitude, and provide rapid mobility across the entire AO. Westin’s team has the skill set to dismantle the network surgically—hitting key nodes, gathering intelligence, and leaving chaos in their wake. It’s unconventional, but it’s what we need.”  

An analyst at the far end of the table scoffed. “Westin’s team? A single squad against the IRGC? That’s suicide. We’d be better off deploying two strike teams supported by drones.”  

Alicia fixed him with a steady gaze. “Two strike teams will draw attention. The Wraith won’t. And Westin’s team doesn’t operate like conventional units. They can hit multiple sites in rapid succession without leaving a trail. The Revolutionary Guard won’t even know where to start looking for them.”  

Grayson’s frown deepened. “This Wraith—what exactly are we dealing with? I’ve heard the stories, but nobody seems to have concrete details.”  

Alicia hesitated. She couldn’t tell them the whole truth—not about the Federation, not about the craft’s extraterrestrial origins. “The Wraith is a next-generation platform,” she said carefully. “Stealth, speed, adaptability—it’s the cutting edge of covert operations. And it’s field-proven.”  

Grayson didn’t look convinced. “And what happens if this super-plane gets spotted? Or worse, shot down? We’d lose more than just the team. We’d lose operational security and any deniability.”  

“It won’t be spotted,” Alicia said firmly. “The Wraith has already operated in environments as hostile as this, and it’s come through clean every time. As for the team—they’re trained for this. They don’t take unnecessary risks.”  

The room fell silent again as Grayson mulled over her words. Finally, he exhaled sharply and gestured to the map. “Fine. Let’s assume Westin’s team is as good as you say. What’s their approach?”  

Alicia leaned forward, confidence sharpening her voice. “They’ll use the Wraith as their mobile base of operations. First, they’ll infiltrate undetected, identify the key production facilities, and gather intelligence on their distribution network. Once they’ve mapped the system, they’ll systematically dismantle it—eliminating critical personnel, disrupting supply chains, and destroying production sites. And they’ll do it without leaving a trace.”  

“And if they’re compromised?” an operative asked pointedly.  

“They won’t be,” Alicia replied, meeting his gaze. “But if they are, the Wraith is fast enough to exfiltrate them before the IRGC can react. This operation is about precision, not brute force.”  

Grayson nodded slowly, his expression still guarded but less skeptical. “All right, Monroe. You’ve sold me—at least for now. Get Westin’s team briefed and prepped. I want this operation in motion within seventy-two hours.”  

Alicia nodded, a small flicker of relief crossing her face. “Understood. I’ll handle it.”  

As the meeting adjourned and the room emptied, Alicia lingered for a moment, staring at the map. This was the kind of operation that could cement her reputation—or destroy it. She had placed her trust in Westin and the Wraith, and now, all she could do was hope that the Federation’s shadowy technology was as capable as it claimed to be.  

### Mission Briefing  

The operations center aboard the Wraith felt smaller with the entire team present. Captain James Westin, Lieutenant Rena Carter, Sergeant Tomas Finch, and Specialist Olivia Park stood around the central holographic table, its surface glowing with a detailed topographic map of Northern Iran. Markers denoting checkpoints, known narcotics routes, and suspected production facilities flickered in muted red and yellow.

Alicia Monroe’s image hovered above the table, projected from Langley’s secure uplink. Her expression was calm but resolute, her voice carrying the weight of the operation’s stakes.

“This is a tier-one priority mission,” she began. “Our objective is the complete disruption of the Revolutionary Guard’s narcotics network in Northern Iran. The network funds black operations and entrenches their influence in the region. You’ll be cutting off that lifeline—surgically, swiftly, and without leaving a trace.”

The map zoomed in on a dense mountainous area near the Caspian Sea, dotted with clusters of red markers. “These are the suspected production facilities,” Alicia continued. “Our intel suggests multiple sites, each heavily guarded and interconnected by rugged terrain and clandestine routes. The IRGC isn’t just producing drugs here; they’re moving them through local villages, using civilian populations as cover. That means precision is key.”

James nodded, his face stoic. “Rules of engagement?”

“Minimal collateral damage,” Alicia replied. “The Revolutionary Guard can’t know you were there. We want them to think this was internal sabotage—or natural accidents. Hermes will provide tactical support for maintaining deniability.”

“Lovely,” Tomas muttered. “The kind of op where one slip-up means the whole world comes down on us.”

Alicia gave him a pointed look. “That’s why you’re the ones doing this. No one else can.”

The map shifted, highlighting a series of routes crisscrossing the region. “Your first task is recon,” Alicia continued. “You’ll identify key facilities, map their supply lines, and confirm leadership presence. Once the network is mapped, you’ll eliminate their capacity to recover—destroying critical assets, disrupting logistics, and neutralizing leadership without drawing attention.”

Olivia tilted her head. “And extraction? Are we expected to stay in-country until it’s done?”

Alicia’s expression softened slightly. “The Wraith will remain your base of operations. Hermes will ensure you stay mobile and undetected. You’ll operate in phases, returning to the Wraith to resupply and regroup between objectives. Once the network is dismantled, you’ll exfiltrate cleanly.”

James’s gaze flicked to the projection. “Timetable?”

“Three weeks, max,” Alicia said firmly. “Anything longer, and the risk of detection increases exponentially. The IRGC’s counterintelligence teams are sharp. You need to be sharper.”

Rena, standing near the door to the flight deck, glanced toward the shimmering projection. “And if we need extra support?”

“The Wraith is equipped to provide you with all the tools you need,” Alicia replied. “But I’ll be monitoring from Langley. If something changes, you’ll be the first to know.”

James exchanged a look with his team, then turned back to Alicia. “Understood. We’ll get it done.”

“Good,” Alicia said, her voice firm. “This mission doesn’t just stop the IRGC—it sends a message. Stay sharp, stay invisible, and come back safe.” Her image flickered, and the projection faded, leaving the team in the quiet hum of the operations center.

---

As the briefing ended, the team dispersed to their stations, checking gear and settling into their roles. Rena lingered by the door to the flight deck, her fingers tapping idly on the frame. She glanced at the team, then spoke up. 

“Say, Hermes? Can I try? Y’know, flying you?”  

The AI’s voice responded, smooth and steady. “An interesting proposition, Lieutenant Carter.” A pause followed, almost as if Hermes were genuinely considering the request. Then, with a soft chime, the door to the flight deck slid open. “Of course, Ms. Carter. Take a seat, and we’ll begin instruction.”  

Rena’s eyes lit up as she stepped into the flight deck, glancing back at the others with a grin. “Guess I’ll be the one keeping us airborne.”

Tomas laughed. “Just don’t crash us before we get there.”

---

The rest of the team settled into their respective spaces as the Wraith powered up. The craft’s hum deepened into a low vibration, the interior lighting shifting to a soft blue that signified stealth mode. From the cockpit, Rena’s voice came through the intercom, a mix of excitement and focus. “Pre-flight checks are green. Hermes, walk me through takeoff.”

“Engage primary engines and set thrust to forty percent,” Hermes instructed, his voice calm and clear. “Ascend at a fifteen-degree angle until we reach two thousand feet, then initiate the transition to sub-orbital mode.”

Rena’s hands moved over the controls with precision, following the AI’s guidance. The Wraith lifted smoothly, its stealth engines barely audible as it rose into the night sky. Below, the CIA’s airstrip shrank rapidly, swallowed by darkness as the craft gained altitude.

From the operations center, James watched the holographic map as their trajectory shifted eastward. “Set course for Northern Iran,” he ordered.

“Course plotted,” Hermes replied. “Estimated arrival in three hours, twenty-seven minutes.”

As the Wraith climbed higher, its exterior shimmered briefly before fading into the night, the phased refractive array rendering it nearly invisible against the starry backdrop. Inside, the team prepared themselves, each member acutely aware of the stakes ahead.

The Wraith cut through the atmosphere, a silent ghost on a mission that demanded nothing less than perfection.  

### In Transit  

The Wraith cruised silently through the upper atmosphere, its stealth systems rendering it invisible to prying eyes and sensors alike. Inside, the operations center was bathed in soft blue light, the holographic map of Northern Iran glowing faintly on the central table. The terrain was overlaid with suspected IRGC narcotics facilities, checkpoints, and supply routes.  

Captain James Westin stood at the head of the table, his arms crossed as he studied the map. Around him, Lieutenant Rena Carter, Sergeant Tomas Finch, and Specialist Olivia Park leaned against the surrounding consoles, their faces focused as they processed the mission’s demands.  

“Let’s break it down,” James said, his tone brisk. He gestured at the hologram, where a series of red icons marked suspected drug production facilities. “First phase is recon. We need to confirm these sites and identify their critical vulnerabilities—leadership, supply nodes, or chokepoints in their logistics. Olivia, that’s your ballgame.”  

The specialist nodded, tapping a terminal beside her to bring up a detailed view of one of the suspected facilities. “Satellite imagery gives us a start, but I’ll need to deploy drones once we’re in range. Hermes, what’s our payload?”  

“The Wraith is equipped with four short-range reconnaissance drones,” Hermes replied smoothly. “Each is capable of stealth operations with optical, thermal, and electromagnetic sensors. They can be controlled remotely or operate autonomously with my guidance.”  

Olivia nodded, already planning. “We’ll deploy two over the most active sites to monitor patterns. The other two can sweep for unknown routes or hidden installations. Should give us enough data to prioritize targets.”  

James nodded. “Good. Once we have intel, we’ll move into phase two—disruption. That’s where you come in, Tomas.”  

The sergeant leaned forward, his rough demeanor replaced by sharp focus. “We’re talking infrastructure hits, yeah? Warehouses, transport hubs, maybe some ‘accidental’ fires in production facilities?”  

“Exactly,” James confirmed. “But we keep it quiet. No explosions that scream sabotage. If the IRGC figures out we’re targeting them directly, the whole operation falls apart.”  

Tomas smirked. “Stealthy chaos. Got it.”  

James’s gaze shifted to Rena. “Rena, you’ll be juggling a lot. The Wraith needs to stay mobile—close enough to deploy and exfil us, but far enough to avoid detection. You comfortable with that?”  

Rena shrugged, her easy confidence barely masking her excitement. “Hermes and I are getting along fine. Besides, with this bird’s stealth tech, they won’t even know we’re there.”  

“Still, no risks,” James said firmly. “The IRGC’s radar systems might not pick us up, but we can’t rule out visual contact if someone’s in the right place at the wrong time. Keep us in low-visibility zones—mountain shadows, weather cover, anything that works.”  

Hermes chimed in. “I will monitor local conditions and propose optimal flight paths. Lieutenant Carter’s piloting skills are commendable, but rest assured, I can assume control if necessary.”  

Rena rolled her eyes, a faint smirk playing at her lips. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Hermes. I think I’ve got it under control.”  

James allowed himself a faint smile but quickly refocused. “Phase three is the hardest part—neutralizing leadership. We need to identify the key players running this operation and take them out. Quietly. No bodies left behind, no trails for the IRGC to follow.”  

Tomas frowned. “Any idea who we’re looking for?”  

“Not yet,” James admitted. “That’s why recon is critical. Once we’ve mapped their network, we’ll know who’s calling the shots. When we do, we’ll have to move fast. Olivia, you’ll handle tracking movements and pinpointing opportunities. Tomas and I will handle the direct action.”  

Olivia raised an eyebrow. “You’re pulling me out of the field for phase three?”  

James nodded. “We’ll need you on the Wraith, coordinating. You’ll have a better vantage here, and Hermes will help you stay ahead of their comms.”  

She didn’t look thrilled but nodded in understanding. “Fair enough. Someone’s gotta keep you guys alive.”  

Rena leaned back, folding her arms. “And what about contingencies? What if things go sideways?”  

James’s expression hardened. “Then we adapt. The Wraith is fast enough to pull us out of almost anything, and Hermes will be monitoring for threats. But if we’re compromised, the mission ends. This operation is bigger than any one objective—we don’t take unnecessary risks.”  

“Understood,” Rena said, though her expression hinted at concern.  

Hermes’s voice cut through the momentary silence, calm and steady. “Captain Westin, we are approximately forty-five minutes from the designated operational area. I recommend a final review of equipment and protocols.”  

James glanced around the room, his team meeting his gaze in turn. “You heard Hermes. Gear check, final prep. We’ve got one shot to do this right—let’s not waste it.”  

As the team dispersed to their respective tasks, the Wraith continued its silent flight eastward, a ghost in the upper atmosphere. Below, the jagged mountains of Northern Iran waited, cloaked in darkness and danger.  

---  

In the cockpit, Rena settled into the pilot’s seat, her fingers brushing the controls as the faint glow of the instruments reflected in her eyes. Hermes’s voice filled the space, steady and almost conversational. “Lieutenant Carter, I have optimized our flight path for minimal radar and visual exposure. Would you like me to take over?”  

Rena smirked, adjusting the yoke. “Not a chance. I’ve got this.”  

The Wraith’s engines thrummed faintly as it carried them closer to their objective, a sleek shadow poised to strike.  

### Insertion  

The Wraith descended silently through the cold night air, its stealth systems rendering it a faint shadow against the star-strewn sky. Below, the jagged terrain of Northern Iran stretched out like a sleeping beast—forested hills rising into rocky crags and snow-dusted peaks. In the operations center, the team sat in tense silence, the faint hum of the craft’s systems a constant reminder of their mission’s precarious nature.

Hermes’s voice broke the quiet. “Approaching the designated insertion zone. Commencing final descent.”

James Westin leaned over the holographic map, watching the terrain markers grow larger as the Wraith neared the ground. He glanced toward Rena in the cockpit. “How’s our visibility?”

“Minimal,” Rena replied, her hands steady on the controls. “We’re threading the needle here—landing zone’s surrounded by dense foliage, but it’s shielded from any direct line of sight.”

“Good,” James said. “Bring us down gently.”

---

#### Landing

The Wraith’s landing gear extended with a soft mechanical hiss as it settled into a narrow clearing nestled between thick trees and jagged rock outcroppings. Its matte-black hull blended seamlessly with the shadows, the faint blue glow of its ambient lighting barely illuminating the ground below.

Inside, the team moved with purpose. James adjusted his vest, checking the fit of his gear, while Tomas hefted his rifle, the weapon’s matte surface catching the dim light.

“Drones first,” James said. “Then we secure the perimeter.”

Olivia nodded, already at a console near the operations center. “Hermes, prep the launch bays.”

“Launch bays are online,” Hermes confirmed, his tone calm. “Awaiting your command, Specialist Park.”

Olivia tapped the controls, and the sound of shifting mechanisms echoed faintly through the Wraith. On its dorsal side, four concealed panels slid open, revealing small drone launchers. The drones themselves—sleek, angular devices no larger than a hawk—sat in their cradles, their surfaces glinting faintly as they powered up.

“Deploying drones,” Olivia announced. She hit a final command, and with a soft whir, the first pair of drones launched skyward. Their engines were almost imperceptible as they climbed into the night, disappearing into the darkness within seconds. Moments later, the second pair followed, each programmed with its designated search pattern.

“Drones are active,” Hermes reported. “Initial scans are underway. I will provide updates as data becomes available.”

Olivia studied her console, where live feeds from the drones flickered into view. One displayed a thermal map of the surrounding area, while another highlighted electromagnetic activity. “They’re clear so far. Let’s hope it stays that way.”

---

#### Securing the Perimeter

Tomas slung his rifle over his shoulder, nodding toward James. “I’ll sweep the area. If anyone’s watching us, they won’t be for long.”

“Stay sharp,” James said. “And keep comms open.”

“Roger that,” Tomas replied, tapping the discreet earpiece Hermes had provided. He exited the Wraith, his boots crunching softly against the frost-dusted ground. 

The clearing was cold and still, the faint rustle of leaves in the wind the only sound. Tomas moved methodically, scanning the treeline with practiced precision. His rifle’s sight flickered faintly as he activated its low-light mode, the terrain ahead rendered in sharp contrast.

As he circled the perimeter, Tomas’s voice came through the comms. “Clear so far. No heat signatures, no movement.”

James’s voice replied over the line. “Copy that. Make sure the approach paths are clean. If anyone stumbles into this zone, we need to know about it first.”

“On it,” Tomas said. He continued his sweep, pausing occasionally to check the terrain for signs of recent activity. The cold bit at his face, but he ignored it, his focus unwavering. Finally, after completing a full circuit, he keyed his comms again. “Perimeter’s secure. No signs of activity. We’re good.”

---

#### Back at the Wraith  

Inside the Wraith, Olivia monitored the drones’ feeds, her fingers darting across the console as she adjusted their trajectories. “Drones are picking up heat blooms near the eastern ridge,” she said. “Looks like a village. Nothing unusual so far, but I’ll keep them circling.”

“Good,” James said, his eyes on the map. “We’ll let them do the heavy lifting for now. Tomas, head back. We’ll regroup and assess next steps.”

“On my way,” Tomas replied, his silhouette emerging from the treeline moments later.

As the team reconvened inside the Wraith, Hermes’s voice cut through the ambient hum. “Initial drone sweeps have identified several points of interest. Thermal scans suggest human activity consistent with checkpoint operations and potential logistical hubs. Further analysis is required to confirm narcotics-related activity.”

James nodded. “We’ll start with the nearest points and work outward. Rena, keep us ready for rapid relocation if we need it. Olivia, keep those drones running. Tomas, stay sharp—your sweep was clean, but things can change fast.”

The team exchanged brief nods, their expressions resolute. Outside, the Wraith sat cloaked in shadow, its drones circling overhead like silent sentinels. The operation had begun.  

### Scouting the Distribution Hubs  

The Wraith hummed faintly as it lifted off from the clearing, its engines operating at barely a whisper under Hermes’s control. Inside, the team prepared for their first foray into enemy territory, checking their gear and reviewing the latest drone feeds.

---

#### In Transit  

“Here,” Olivia said, pointing at the holographic map. Two red icons blinked in a valley about fifteen kilometers from their position. “The drones picked up heavy activity at these locations. Trucks coming and going, some guarded checkpoints, and irregular heat signatures in the surrounding terrain. My guess? Distribution hubs.”

James studied the display, his expression sharp. “What’s the terrain like?”

“Rugged,” Olivia replied. “The first site is tucked into a hollow near a dry riverbed. Plenty of natural cover, but also a lot of open ground leading to it. The second is farther up the valley, surrounded by cliffs. Harder to approach, but more defensible for them.”

“We’ll hit the first one,” James said. “If it’s as active as it looks, we can confirm their logistics pattern before moving on to the second. Hermes, you have an insertion point?”

Hermes’s voice was calm and precise. “A narrow ridge approximately three hundred meters west of the target provides optimal vantage. It is accessible on foot and obscured from direct observation. I will maintain a safe holding position once you disembark.”

James nodded. “Good. Rena, keep the Wraith ready for quick exfil. If things go south, we don’t wait around.”

“You got it,” Rena replied from the cockpit, her hands steady on the controls.

---

#### The Insertion  

The Wraith descended toward the ridge under the cover of darkness, its cloaking system blending seamlessly with the rugged terrain. The landing was feather-light, the craft’s stabilizers absorbing the uneven ground with ease. The ramp lowered soundlessly, and the team moved out, their gear carefully secured for the operation.  

The night was cold and still, the air sharp with the scent of pine and dust. James led the way, his rifle held low but ready, while Tomas followed, sweeping their flanks. Olivia carried a small tablet connected to the drones, her eyes flicking between the live feed and the terrain ahead.

“Keep it quiet,” James murmured, his voice barely audible over the comms. “Olivia, guide us in.”

“Copy that,” she replied. “Target’s three hundred meters ahead, just over the ridge. We’ve got cover until the last fifty meters, then it’s open ground.”

Tomas glanced at James. “What’s the play when we hit the open?”

“Stay low, stay fast,” James said. “We’re not engaging unless we have to. This is recon, not a raid.”

---

#### The Ridge  

The team reached the edge of the ridge, crouching low behind a line of jagged rocks. Below them, the target came into view—a small cluster of buildings nestled against the base of the valley. Dim lights glowed from the windows, and several trucks were parked in a dirt clearing. Armed guards patrolled lazily, their flashlights casting long, sweeping beams across the compound.

Olivia pulled up the drone feed, overlaying real-time markers onto their view. “Main building’s here,” she said, pointing to a squat, reinforced structure near the center. “Storage units here and here. Guards are concentrated near the vehicles and along the perimeter.”

James scanned the area through his scope. “Looks like fifteen, maybe twenty personnel. They’re keeping it low-key—no uniforms, but the gear’s too good for civilians.”

“Confirmed,” Olivia said. “Thermal scans picked up at least four more inside the main building. Could be operators or supervisors.”

Tomas smirked faintly. “Bet they’re not expecting company.”

“We’re not here to announce ourselves,” James said. “Olivia, get the drones to sweep the trucks. Let’s see what they’re moving.”

“On it,” she said, her fingers dancing across her tablet. High above, the drones shifted their flight paths, their sensors focusing on the vehicles. A moment later, Olivia frowned.

“Mixed signatures,” she reported. “Looks like some standard cargo, but two of the trucks are shielded. Thermal can’t penetrate the containers.”

“Drugs,” James muttered. “Or worse.”

“What’s the call?” Rena’s voice came softly through their comms.

“We’re sticking to recon,” James replied. “We need more intel before we hit them directly. Olivia, can you get closer with the drones? Maybe into the main building?”

“Risky,” she said. “They’ve got a basic jammer on the perimeter. I can counter it, but it’ll take a few seconds—and they might notice.”

“Not worth it,” James decided. “Mark the jammer’s location for later. We’ll need to disable it if we come back.”

“Copy that,” Olivia said, tagging the device on her map.  

---

#### A Close Call  

The team continued to observe for another twenty minutes, cataloging guard rotations, vehicle movements, and potential weaknesses. As James scanned the compound again, a new vehicle pulled up—a black SUV with tinted windows.  

“Got something,” he murmured. “Hermes, can you enhance the feed on that SUV?”

“Enhancing,” Hermes replied, his voice steady. A live feed from one of the drones zoomed in, showing the license plate and occupants stepping out. The SUV’s passenger was a stocky man in his fifties, dressed in a sharp suit that clashed with the casual attire of the guards.

“Who’s that?” Tomas asked, his tone sharpening.

“Unknown,” Olivia said, quickly running the image through her recognition software. “He’s not in our database. Could be local leadership—or someone higher up.”

James’s jaw tightened. “We’ll flag him for now. Let’s move out before we overstay our welcome.”

The team began their retreat, moving quietly back toward the Wraith. Tomas kept a sharp eye on their rear, ensuring they left no signs of their presence.

---

#### Back on the Wraith  

As the team boarded, the ramp closed behind them with a soft hiss. Rena was already at the controls, and the craft lifted off moments later, disappearing into the night.  

“Good recon,” James said as the Wraith gained altitude. “We’ve got plenty to work with for phase two. Hermes, log everything and update our operational map.”

“Data logged and processed,” Hermes replied. “Awaiting your next directive.”

James turned to the team, his expression serious but satisfied. “We’ve got a picture now. Let’s get ready to take it apart.”

The Wraith soared into the darkness, leaving the compound below untouched—for now.  

### Planning Phase Two  

The Wraith rested silently in a secluded hollow, its matte-black hull blending seamlessly with the rugged terrain. Inside, the team had gathered around the holographic table in the operations center, the glow of the terrain map illuminating their faces. Hermes’s calm, precise voice filled the room, breaking down the intel they had gathered during their recon.

“Analysis of the drone footage and intercepted communications confirms the compound’s purpose,” Hermes said. The map zoomed in on the first hub they had scouted, highlighting key buildings and movement patterns. “The facility serves as a distribution hub, with narcotics loaded into shielded containers and transported to secondary locations. These locations are not yet confirmed, but radio chatter suggests a schedule for the next shipment.”

James Westin stood at the head of the table, his arms crossed. “When’s the next shipment due?”

“Within the next twenty-four hours,” Hermes replied. “They are currently preparing two vehicles for transit. Based on the observed activity, they will move under cover of darkness, likely along the route marked here.” A glowing line traced through the terrain, showing the projected convoy path.  

Olivia Park frowned as she studied the map. “It’s a narrow route. One way in, one way out. If we hit them there, we can stop the shipment cold.”

“True,” Hermes said. “However, the route’s proximity to nearby checkpoints increases the likelihood of reinforcements. Disabling the convoy will require speed and precision to avoid a protracted engagement.”

Rena Carter leaned back in her chair, arms folded. “What about the second hub? Shouldn’t we be hitting both at once? If they lose one shipment but keep the other, we’re not exactly shutting them down.”

Hermes adjusted the display, highlighting the second hub. “The second facility appears less active but likely serves as a staging area for supply trucks. Disabling it simultaneously would create significant disruption to their logistics chain.”

Tomas Finch grinned faintly. “Sounds like we’ve got a two-for-one deal on our hands. What’s the play, Cap?”

James stared at the map for a moment, his mind working through the options. Finally, he spoke. “We’ll split our focus. The convoy is our primary target, but we’ll plant a seed of chaos at the second hub to keep them guessing.”

He pointed at the first hub. “Tomas, Olivia, and I will handle the convoy. We’ll disable the vehicles, secure the shipment, and vanish before they know what hit them.” His finger moved to the second hub. “Rena, you’ll stay with the Wraith and position it near this facility. Use the drones to sow confusion—disable their trucks, cut their comms, maybe even light up some of their supplies. Keep it surgical, but make it look like sabotage.”

Rena smirked. “You just want me to have all the fun.”

“I trust you to keep it clean,” James said. “We’re playing a long game here. They can’t know it’s us.”

---

#### Hermes's Analysis  

Hermes shifted the map’s view to show intercepted communications and local traffic patterns. “While the IRGC’s communications are encrypted, analysis of local phone chatter suggests heightened activity in the region. They appear to be monitoring for unusual movements or disruptions. You’ll need to assume they’re on alert.”

“Any indication they’ve spotted us?” Olivia asked.

“None,” Hermes replied. “Their focus appears to be internal—monitoring rival factions and ensuring operational security within their ranks. However, the presence of an unidentified VIP at the first hub suggests an elevated security posture.”

James’s expression darkened. “What do we know about the VIP?”

“Limited,” Hermes admitted. “However, radio traffic indicates he’s overseeing the shipment. If we intercept the convoy, we may have an opportunity to extract him for interrogation.”

Tomas grunted. “That’s a big maybe. If he’s riding in that convoy, he’s not gonna come quietly.”

James nodded. “We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. For now, we focus on the shipment. Anything else, Hermes?”

“Notable vulnerabilities,” Hermes said. The map shifted to highlight potential weak points along the convoy route and the second hub. “The convoy will cross a narrow bridge here. Disabling it will trap the vehicles but could raise suspicion. Alternatively, a roadblock in this area”—he pointed to a sharp curve surrounded by dense foliage—“would allow you to intercept discreetly without drawing immediate attention.”

Olivia tapped the curve on her tablet. “Roadblock’s better. We can hit them fast and hard, then disappear.”

“Agreed,” James said. “Hermes, what about the second hub?”

“Thermal scans indicate two active vehicles and a small group of guards. The drones can neutralize the vehicles and create diversions with minimal exposure.”

James turned to Rena. “You good with that?”

Rena gave him a thumbs-up. “Drones are easier to handle than this bird. Just say the word.”

---

#### Final Preparations  

James straightened, his voice taking on a commanding edge. “All right, here’s the breakdown. Tomas, Olivia, and I will hit the convoy at the curve. We disable the vehicles, secure the shipment, and withdraw before reinforcements arrive. Rena, you stay with the Wraith and take down the second hub from a distance. Make it look like sabotage, but don’t overplay your hand.”

He looked at each of them in turn. “No mistakes. No unnecessary risks. We’ve got one shot to make this work.”

The team nodded, their faces set with resolve.  

Hermes’s voice added a final note. “Mission parameters uploaded. I will provide real-time support and updates as the situation develops. Good luck.”

James glanced at the holographic map one last time, then at his team. “Gear up. We move in fifteen.”

The team dispersed to ready their equipment, the faint hum of the Wraith’s systems underscoring the tension in the air. Outside, the rugged terrain lay cloaked in darkness, waiting for the coming storm.

### Dual Assault  

The Wraith hovered in complete silence above a dense stretch of forest, cloaked from sight and sensors. Inside, the team split into their respective roles. Captain James Westin, Sergeant Tomas Finch, and Specialist Olivia Park exited the craft, their boots crunching faintly against the frost-dusted forest floor. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Rena Carter remained aboard, her hands deftly manipulating the drone controls. The plan was in motion.

---

#### Rena’s Perspective: Staging Area  

Rena sat in the operations center, her eyes locked on the drone feeds displayed across multiple screens. Four drones hovered in loose formation over the second hub, their stealth systems active. The facility was dimly lit, with two boxy trucks parked near the main building and a smattering of guards patrolling lazily.  

“Drones are in position,” Hermes reported. “Thermal scans show minimal personnel—five guards outside, three inside the main building.”

“Perfect,” Rena murmured, her fingers brushing the console. “Let’s light them up a little.”  

She selected the lead drone and queued its onboard EMP payload. A moment later, the drone swooped low, gliding silently over the trucks. With a soft whine, the EMP activated, sending a pulse of energy rippling outward. Sparks erupted from the trucks’ hoods, their engines dying with a final, pitiful sputter.

---

#### James’s Perspective: Convoy Interception  

James, Tomas, and Olivia crouched behind thick underbrush along the convoy’s path. The curve in the road provided natural concealment, and the dense foliage was perfect for an ambush. The hum of approaching engines grew louder, the faint glow of headlights casting long shadows.  

“Two trucks, SUV at the rear,” Olivia whispered, her tablet displaying real-time updates from her drone. “Guards in the SUV—three, armed. Likely escorting the VIP.”

James nodded. “Tomas, take the lead truck. Olivia, disable the SUV. I’ll handle the rear truck.”

“Copy,” Tomas murmured, checking his rifle.  

---

#### Rena’s Perspective: Staging Area  

As the trucks at the staging area fell silent, confusion rippled through the guards. Two of them approached the disabled vehicles, weapons slung loosely over their shoulders.

“Right where I want you,” Rena muttered, steering a second drone closer. This one carried a small incendiary charge. It hovered over the truck bed, then released the device, which dropped with surgical precision onto a stack of crates.  

The explosion wasn’t large, but it was enough to ignite the flammable contents inside. Flames roared to life, casting flickering light across the compound. The guards scrambled, shouting in alarm.

“Two more guards heading toward the fire,” Hermes noted.  

Rena smirked. “Let’s keep them busy.”

---

#### James’s Perspective: Convoy Interception  

The convoy rounded the curve, the trucks slowing slightly as they navigated the narrow road. James raised his hand in a silent signal. Olivia triggered a small device—a disguised road spike mat—that sprang into place just as the SUV passed.  

The result was immediate. The SUV’s tires shredded with a sharp burst of sound, the vehicle skidding to a halt. The trucks stopped ahead, their drivers confused but not yet panicked.

Tomas surged forward, his rifle up. A burst of suppressed fire disabled the engine of the lead truck, the driver scrambling out with hands raised. Olivia darted toward the SUV, using its stalled momentum as cover, while James flanked the rear truck.

The guards in the SUV recovered quickly, exiting with weapons drawn. Olivia ducked behind the vehicle, her handgun barking twice. One guard dropped with a sharp cry, while the other staggered, clutching his shoulder.

James yanked open the door of the rear truck, dragging the startled driver out and slamming him to the ground. “Stay down,” he hissed, securing the man with zip ties before moving to secure the truck.

---

#### Rena’s Perspective: Staging Area  

With the fire roaring at the staging area, Rena guided another drone toward the main building. The guards were too distracted to notice as the drone’s camera zoomed in, scanning the interior through the thin walls. 

“Crates inside,” Hermes reported. “Likely narcotics, though confirmation requires physical access.”

“Noted,” Rena said. “Let’s make sure they don’t move anything tonight.”

She directed the final drone to the building’s exterior, releasing a second EMP pulse. The lights inside flickered and died, plunging the area into darkness.

“Now let’s see how they handle chaos,” she muttered.

---

#### James’s Perspective: Convoy Interception  

With the guards subdued, James turned his attention to the SUV. The VIP—a stocky man in a sharp suit—was cursing in Farsi, clutching a phone that was clearly nonfunctional thanks to the spike’s EMP companion device.

“Get him out,” James ordered. Tomas dragged the man from the vehicle, his grip firm despite the man’s protests.

Olivia was already inspecting the trucks. “Shielded containers are here,” she confirmed, knocking on one of the crates. “Definitely the shipment.”

James glanced at the ravine beside the road. “We’re not taking it with us. Push it over.”

Tomas raised an eyebrow. “All of it?”

“All of it,” James said firmly. “No evidence.”

Tomas nodded, climbing into the truck’s cab. He released the brakes, and with a groaning lurch, the truck began rolling toward the edge. Olivia followed suit with the second truck, sending it careening down the ravine with a satisfying crash.  

---

#### Conclusion  

Back at the Wraith, the team regrouped, their prisoner restrained and seated in a holding cell. Rena watched them board, her grin fading as she noticed the subdued tension on James’s face.

“We got him,” James said as the ramp closed. “And we made a mess of their shipment. But it’s only phase two.”

“Good,” Rena said, powering down the drones. “Because they’re definitely going to notice now.”

The Wraith ascended into the night, leaving behind flames, confusion, and a broken convoy. The IRGC had no idea what hit them.  

### The Interrogation  

The Wraith settled into a new secluded location, this time a shallow ravine bordered by steep cliffs and dense vegetation. Its engines powered down to a whisper, and its exterior cloaking engaged, leaving it virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain. Inside, the atmosphere was tense.  

In the small, sterile holding cell at the rear of the craft, the captured VIP sat in silence, his sharp suit wrinkled and his expression taut. His wrists were bound to the table in front of him, and a faint sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead. The room was dim, with only a single overhead light casting a harsh glow on his face.  

James Westin stood across from the man, arms crossed, while Olivia Park monitored the Wraith’s sensor feeds from a nearby console. Tomas Finch leaned casually against the wall, his presence as much a psychological tool as it was a precaution. Rena Carter sat in the operations center, monitoring the conversation remotely alongside Hermes, who provided real-time analysis through their earpieces.  

---

#### The Interrogation Begins  

James began calmly. “You’ve had a rough night. Care to tell us your name?”  

The man glared, his lips pressed into a thin line. After a moment, he barked something in Farsi, his tone defiant.  

Hermes’s voice chimed softly in James’s earpiece. “Translation: ‘You’ve made a mistake. Do you know who I am?’ Elevated heart rate detected. Moderate stress response.”  

James nodded slightly, his face unreadable. “I do know who you are, Mr. Davood Karami. Local logistics kingpin, Revolutionary Guard puppet, and occasional narcotics broker. You run a tidy little empire, but tonight it got messy, didn’t it?”  

Karami flinched slightly, his bravado faltering for a moment before he straightened. “You have no authority here,” he said in accented English. “My people will come for me. They will find you.”  

Hermes’s analysis was immediate. “Lie detected. Subject exhibits signs of disorientation and bluffing.”  

James leaned forward, his voice cold. “You’re bluffing. If they were coming for you, we’d already see them. Your trucks are gone, your shipment’s at the bottom of a ravine, and your men are scrambling to figure out what just happened. You’re alone, Karami.”  

The man’s jaw tightened, his breathing shallow. Hermes’s voice whispered in James’s ear. “Subject’s stress levels increasing. Pulse elevated to 115 BPM.”  

---

#### Applying Pressure  

Tomas stepped closer, letting his presence loom over the seated man. “Here’s the thing,” he said, his voice low and menacing. “We don’t need you alive. If you’re not useful, you’re expendable. You’re just a cog in a big machine, Karami. Replaceable.”  

Karami’s eyes darted to Tomas, then back to James. “What do you want?” he spat.  

James straightened, his tone shifting to a razor’s edge. “I want the truth. Who are you supplying? Where are the rest of the hubs? And how do they move product across the region? Give me that, and maybe—just maybe—you get out of this alive.”  

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Karami said quickly.  

“Lie detected,” Hermes noted quietly. “Stress response spiking. Continue pressure.”  

James slammed his hand on the table, the sharp sound making Karami flinch. “Don’t insult my intelligence! You’re the one overseeing this operation. You know every name, every route, every detail. Start talking.”  

---

#### Cracking the Shell  

Karami’s shoulders sagged slightly, his facade beginning to crumble. He looked between James and Tomas, then glanced toward the empty corners of the room as if searching for an escape.  

Olivia’s voice came through James’s earpiece. “His breathing’s erratic. He’s close to breaking.”  

James softened his tone slightly, leaning in. “Listen, Karami. You’re in a bad spot, but you’re not stupid. You’ve been in this game long enough to know when it’s over. Give us what we want, and maybe we can make this easier for you. Refuse, and we leave you here. Alone. To deal with the IRGC when they figure out you’re the reason their shipment disappeared.”  

Karami’s eyes widened, a flicker of fear breaking through his defiance. “They’ll kill me,” he whispered.  

James nodded grimly. “Exactly. But I don’t care about you. I care about shutting this network down. You help me, and maybe I make sure they never find you. Now start talking.”  

---

#### The Information  

Karami hesitated, his breath shallow, before he finally spoke. “There are three more hubs,” he said, his voice trembling. “One in the mountains near Rasht, another south of Bandar-e Anzali, and a smaller one outside Lahijan. The main shipment routes go through local contacts—drivers, villagers, people too afraid to say no.”  

James exchanged a brief glance with Tomas before pressing further. “And the leadership? Who’s in charge of this operation?”  

Karami swallowed hard. “Colonel Abbas Rezaei,” he admitted. “He’s IRGC, stationed in Tehran, but he visits the hubs regularly. He’s the one who coordinates with the buyers.”  

Hermes’s voice confirmed in James’s ear. “No signs of deception. Subject’s stress levels have decreased slightly—truth likely.”  

James nodded. “Good. That’s a start. Now tell me about the buyers. Who are they, and where are they getting the product?”  

Karami hesitated again, his fear clear, but James’s cold stare broke through his resistance. “They’re foreigners. Cartels from South America, some Russians. They pay cash or weapons. The shipments leave through the Caspian—boats or planes, depending on the cargo.”  

“Specifics,” James demanded.  

“Docks in Bandar-e Anzali,” Karami said quickly. “But they rotate. I don’t know more—I swear.”  

Hermes’s voice chimed softly. “Subject is likely truthful.”  

James leaned back, his expression hard. “You’ve just given me a lot of reasons to keep you alive, Karami. Let’s hope it’s enough.”  

Karami slumped in his chair, defeated. “You’ll protect me?”  

James didn’t answer immediately. He turned to Tomas and Olivia. “Secure him. We’ve got work to do.”  

---

The Wraith’s systems hummed faintly as the team prepared for their next move, the intel they had extracted from Karami setting the stage for the next phase of their mission. Outside, the night remained quiet, the craft’s cloaking keeping it hidden from prying eyes.  

### Analysis and Opportunity  

The Wraith hummed quietly in the ravine, a bastion of calm amidst the tension of the operation. Inside, the team gathered in the operations center, their expressions serious as they pored over the data extracted from Davood Karami. The man himself remained in the holding cell, subdued and silent after his interrogation.  

The holographic table displayed an updated map of Northern Iran, with new markers highlighting the hubs Karami had mentioned. One near Rasht, another south of Bandar-e Anzali, and a smaller one near Lahijan were all flagged as high-priority targets. The map also displayed suspected routes and logistical patterns, pieced together from Karami’s information and the Wraith’s data analysis.  

---

#### Analyzing the Intel  

“Three hubs,” James said, his voice calm but commanding. “We need to hit them in sequence, but strategically. If we take out one, the others might tighten security or shift their operations. We need to stay ahead of them.”  

Rena nodded, leaning against the table with her arms crossed. “Rasht’s hub is the biggest. Makes sense to save it for last and cut off their escape routes.”  

Olivia tapped on the map, zooming in on the Lahijan hub. “This one’s smaller but more isolated. If we hit it first, we can figure out their immediate response patterns before moving to the others.”  

Tomas studied the routes displayed on the map. “And the Bandar-e Anzali hub? That’s tied to their shipments, right? If we cripple their docks, we cut off their export capability entirely.”  

“Agreed,” James said. “We’ll need more intel to figure out the best approach. Hermes, what have we got from Karami’s phone?”  

---

#### Intercepting Communications  

Hermes’s voice was calm and precise. “The phone has been integrated into the Wraith’s systems. I am monitoring all incoming and outgoing communications. Additionally, I have compiled a pattern of recent activity. Karami has been in contact with several individuals linked to the hubs, including drivers, local enforcers, and IRGC officers.”  

“Anything actionable?” Olivia asked.  

“Several messages reference Colonel Abbas Rezaei,” Hermes replied. “He appears to oversee the network directly. His most recent correspondence suggests he is planning to visit one of the hubs within the next forty-eight hours.”  

James’s eyes narrowed. “That’s a window. If we intercept him, we can dismantle this entire operation from the top down.”  

Before anyone could respond, Karami’s phone, now connected to a console, began to vibrate. The team froze as Hermes spoke. “Incoming call from Colonel Abbas Rezaei.”  

Rena’s eyes widened. “This is it. Can you handle it?”  

“Of course,” Hermes replied smoothly. “I have compiled a vocal profile of Karami using the audio captured during interrogation. I will replicate his voice perfectly.”  

James gave a curt nod. “Put it through. Let’s hear what he wants.”  

---

#### The Call  

Hermes routed the call to the operations center, and Karami’s voice filled the room, though it was the AI speaking.  

“Colonel,” Hermes said, his tone matching Karami’s nervous cadence perfectly. “How can I assist you?”  

Rezaei’s voice came through, calm and commanding. “Karami, I am visiting the Rasht hub tomorrow evening. We need to ensure everything is in order. I trust there will be no complications?”  

Hermes hesitated for a fraction of a second before responding. “Of course, Colonel. Everything is under control. May I suggest an alternate route? There’s been increased police activity near the main road—you wouldn’t want unnecessary attention.”  

The Colonel’s tone remained measured. “Very well. Send me the route details.”  

Hermes replied with feigned deference. “I’ll send it immediately, sir. Safe travels.”  

The line disconnected, and Hermes’s calm voice replaced Karami’s. “The Colonel agreed to my suggestion. I have routed him through this area.” The map shifted, highlighting a narrow stretch of road winding through dense forest and cliffs.  

Tomas grinned. “Perfect spot for an ambush. Limited visibility, no easy escape routes.”  

Olivia frowned slightly. “He’ll have an escort, though. We need to plan for that.”  

“Agreed,” James said. “Rena, you’ll keep the Wraith ready for fast extraction. Tomas and I will handle the ambush, and Olivia will coordinate with Hermes to monitor the situation.”  

“Understood,” Hermes said. “I will simulate the Colonel’s voice to confirm his itinerary if necessary. Additionally, I can deploy drones to monitor the route in real time.”  

James looked around the table, meeting each team member’s gaze. “This is our chance to take out their top man. We do this clean, no mistakes. Everyone ready?”  

The team nodded, their resolve clear. Outside, the Wraith’s cloaked hull remained a silent guardian in the night, poised for the next phase of their mission.  

### Ambush in the Forest  

The night air was still, the dense forest along the narrow road shrouded in silence. The Wraith hovered in stealth mode a few kilometers away, concealed by its cloaking systems and dense terrain. In the shadows near the road, Captain James Westin, Sergeant Tomas Finch, and Specialist Olivia Park crouched, weapons at the ready.  

Drones buzzed softly overhead, their silent engines providing a bird’s-eye view of the road. Hermes’s calm voice came through their earpieces.  

“Colonel Rezaei’s convoy is two minutes out. Two vehicles: a lead SUV with three guards and the Colonel’s armored sedan following close behind. Both vehicles are moving at approximately 30 kilometers per hour.”

James adjusted his grip on his rifle, his voice low. “Everyone ready?”  

Tomas grinned, the gleam of anticipation in his eyes. “Always.”  

“Drone one is in position,” Olivia reported, her tablet displaying the live feed. “Hermes, confirm readiness of EMP deployment.”  

“EMP systems are primed,” Hermes replied. “Detonation will disable both vehicles without causing collateral damage. Stand by.”  

James took a deep breath, his focus sharpening. “We hit them hard and fast. No shots unless absolutely necessary. The Colonel is the priority.”  

---

#### The Ambush  

The convoy appeared, headlights slicing through the dark forest as the vehicles rolled cautiously along the narrow road. Just as the lead SUV reached the predetermined choke point, Hermes’s voice came through.  

“EMP deploying in three… two… one.”  

A faint pulse rippled through the air, invisible but devastating. The convoy ground to a halt as the SUV and sedan’s engines sputtered and died. The headlights flickered before plunging the vehicles into darkness.  

“Go!” James hissed, leading the charge.  

Tomas darted toward the SUV, his rifle trained on the guards as they stumbled out, disoriented and shouting orders in Farsi. Before they could react, Tomas fired a quick burst from his weapon—non-lethal rounds striking their chests with enough force to knock them down.  

“Guards neutralized,” Tomas reported.  

James and Olivia moved toward the sedan. The driver and front-seat guard were already scrambling out, their weapons drawn, but Olivia’s suppressed handgun barked twice, striking their arms and forcing them to drop their rifles.  

“Clear the vehicle!” James ordered.  

Olivia yanked open the back door, revealing Colonel Rezaei inside. The man’s face was a mask of fury and fear, his hand reaching for something beneath his jacket.  

“Don’t,” James warned, leveling his rifle. “Out. Now.”  

The Colonel hesitated, then slowly raised his hands. Olivia grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the sedan, forcing him to his knees.  

“Colonel Abbas Rezaei,” James said, his voice cold. “You’re coming with us.”  

Rezaei glared up at him, his jaw clenched. “You’ll regret this,” he spat.  

Tomas approached, zip-tying the Colonel’s hands with practiced efficiency. “Yeah, yeah. Heard it before.”  

---

#### Extraction  

With the convoy neutralized, the team moved quickly to erase any evidence of their presence. Olivia planted a small incendiary charge in the engine bay of each vehicle, ensuring they would be irreparably damaged.  

“Charges set,” she said.  

James nodded. “Rena, we’re ready for pickup.”  

“On my way,” Rena’s voice replied over the comms.  

Moments later, the Wraith descended into the clearing near the road, its ramp lowering as the engines hummed faintly. The team hurried aboard, Tomas dragging the struggling Colonel up the ramp.  

As the Wraith lifted off, Olivia glanced back at the burning vehicles, their flames licking the night sky. “That’ll keep them busy for a while.”  

---

#### The Holding Cell  

Inside the Wraith, Colonel Rezaei was escorted to a second holding cell, his face pale but defiant. Tomas shoved him into the seat, securing his restraints with practiced efficiency.  

Rezaei glared at James, his voice dripping with contempt. “You have no idea who you’re dealing with.”  

James leaned in close, his expression cold. “Neither do you. But you’re about to find out.”  

The Colonel’s face twitched, uncertainty flashing in his eyes for the first time.  

“Hermes,” James said, turning toward the operations center. “Secure our location and begin prepping for interrogation. Let’s see what the Colonel has to say.”  

The Wraith powered through the night, its cloaked hull blending seamlessly into the darkness. Inside, the team prepared for the next phase of their operation, their most valuable prisoner now in their hands.  

### Breaking the Colonel  

The Wraith hummed softly in the background as it hovered in its secluded hold position, cloaked against detection. Inside, the operations center was quiet except for the faint, rhythmic tapping of Olivia’s fingers on her console and the Colonel’s steady breathing. 

Colonel Abbas Rezaei sat in the holding cell, his hands bound to the table in front of him, his sharp suit rumpled but his demeanor resolute. James Westin stood across from him, arms crossed, his gaze unyielding. Tomas Finch leaned against the wall nearby, his intimidating presence an intentional tool of psychological pressure. Olivia monitored from a side station, her eyes fixed on Hermes’s readouts of the Colonel’s stress levels, heart rate, and vocal patterns.

---

#### The Opening Moves  

James broke the silence. “Colonel Rezaei, you’re a smart man. You know how this goes. We’re going to talk, and you’re going to tell us what we need to know. The only question is how long it takes and how much you regret it.”

Rezaei smirked faintly, though the strain in his voice was evident. “You think I fear you? I have survived worse than this. You’ll get nothing from me.”

Hermes’s voice chimed softly in James’s earpiece. “Subject’s heart rate is elevated, though still within controlled levels. Signs of defensive posturing detected. Recommended approach: escalate pressure.”

James leaned in slightly, his voice dropping. “You’ve already lost everything you’ve been running. We’ve burned your shipment, your convoy is gone, and your men are scrambling in the dark. You’re not walking away from this. The only thing you can control now is what happens next.”

---

#### Applying Pressure  

Rezaei’s smirk faltered briefly before he regained composure. “You’re wasting your time. I won’t betray my people.”

Tomas stepped forward, looming over the seated Colonel. “Your people? Don’t give me that garbage. You’ve been lining your pockets with drug money while the IRGC pretends it’s for ‘the cause.’ You think they’ll mourn you when you’re gone?”

Hermes chimed again. “Stress levels increasing. Subject is showing signs of frustration and defensive denial.”

Rezaei’s glare shifted to Tomas. “You know nothing of loyalty. Nothing of sacrifice.”

“Save it,” Tomas shot back. “You’re just another thug in a suit pretending to play patriot.”

James stepped forward, placing both hands on the table, his tone cold and commanding. “Here’s how this works, Colonel. You give us the location of the main factory, and maybe—just maybe—you don’t end up buried in some unmarked grave. Keep stalling, and we’ll dismantle your entire network without you. Your allies will think you sold them out. Your family will think you failed. Is that loyalty?”

Rezaei’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, he said nothing.  

---

#### Escalating the Tactics  

Olivia, monitoring the feeds, interjected. “Hermes, loop the holding cell feed to the Colonel. Make it look like we’re calling his men.”  

Hermes responded immediately. “Simulating outgoing communication. Overlaying visual and auditory cues now.”  

On the small monitor built into the cell’s wall, an image appeared of a man in an IRGC uniform, speaking into a phone. The audio was clear: “Yes, sir. We’re taking the Colonel’s instructions. Proceeding to shut down the Rasht hub immediately.”

Rezaei’s head snapped toward the screen, his eyes wide with alarm. “What are you doing?”  

James straightened, his voice laced with quiet menace. “This is us dismantling your network. Every piece of it, every name, every asset. You think you’re untouchable? Watch how quickly it all falls apart.”  

Hermes’s voice whispered in James’s ear. “Heart rate spiking. Subject’s stress levels nearing breaking point.”  

---

#### The Break  

“Stop,” Rezaei said suddenly, his voice cracking. He glared at James, but the panic was evident in his tone. “You… you don’t understand. If I talk, they’ll kill me. My family—”  

James cut him off. “Your family? You mean the one you’ve put at risk with your greed? The one that’s just as disposable to your superiors as you are? You talk, and we can make sure they’re safe. You stay silent, and they’ll suffer for your failure.”

Rezaei hesitated, the weight of his predicament sinking in. His breathing grew shallow, and his hands trembled slightly against the restraints.  

“Fine,” he said finally, his voice a whisper. “The factory is near Rudbar. It’s hidden in the hills, disguised as a ceramics plant. High security, but it’s the heart of the operation. Without it, the network collapses.”

James exchanged a glance with Olivia, who nodded. “Confirmed. He’s telling the truth.”

---

#### Securing the Information  

James leaned back, his tone measured. “Good choice, Colonel. You just bought yourself a little more time. Hermes, log the coordinates and cross-reference with satellite imagery.”  

“Coordinates logged,” Hermes replied. “Confirming the location matches known terrain markers. This information is consistent with intercepted IRGC communications.”  

Rezaei slumped in his seat, his defiance gone. “You have what you want. Now leave me be.”

James turned to Tomas. “Secure him. We’re done here for now.”  

As Tomas guided the Colonel back to his restraints, James addressed the team. “We’ve got the target. Now we figure out how to burn it to the ground.”  

The Wraith’s hum deepened as it adjusted position, preparing for the next phase of the mission. The Colonel’s information had given them their next step—but the most dangerous part of the operation was still to come.  

### Planning the Factory Strike  

The Wraith hovered silently in the rugged hills above Rudbar, cloaked against detection. Inside, the operations center buzzed with tension as the team gathered around the holographic table. The terrain around the target factory—marked in red—was displayed in intricate detail, overlaid with potential entry points, guard patrol routes, and key infrastructure nodes.

Hermes’s voice was steady, cutting through the room’s silence. “The IRGC will inevitably notice Colonel Rezaei’s disappearance within the next twelve hours, potentially sooner if his scheduled check-ins are missed. I can temporarily cover for him by responding via his phone, but his failure to make a personal appearance will blow our cover. We must act before they secure the facility or move critical assets.”

---

#### Laying Out the Plan  

James Westin frowned, his eyes scanning the map. “So, we’ve got a ticking clock. What’s the fastest way to neutralize the site?”

Hermes highlighted several key locations within the factory complex. “The facility is heavily reliant on its central power hub, located here, and its reinforced storage bunker, located here. Disabling the power will significantly hinder their operations, and the destruction of the storage bunker will ensure their narcotics inventory is unrecoverable.”

Tomas Finch leaned over the map, tapping one of the patrol routes. “How many guards are we looking at?”

“Thermal scans indicate approximately thirty personnel on-site,” Hermes replied. “Standard armaments, including small arms and a few fixed machine-gun emplacements. However, reinforcements from nearby IRGC units are a significant risk if we are detected.”

Olivia Park adjusted the display, zooming in on the power hub. “And the layout? Any vulnerabilities?”

Hermes shifted the map to a detailed schematic of the factory’s perimeter. “The eastern side of the facility has minimal coverage due to the surrounding terrain. This provides the optimal entry point for a covert approach. From there, you can access the power hub within approximately two minutes. Simultaneous strikes on the storage bunker and guard barracks will maximize confusion and prevent coordinated retaliation.”

James nodded. “And extraction?”

“The Wraith will remain in a holding pattern nearby, cloaked and ready for rapid extraction. However, I must note that the facility’s anti-air defenses will complicate close-range support.”

---

#### Hermes’s Plan  

Hermes highlighted several key roles for the operation. “Given the urgency and complexity of the mission, all team members will need to be on the ground, including Lieutenant Carter. The plan is as follows:

1. **Captain Westin and Sergeant Finch** will infiltrate the eastern perimeter and neutralize the power hub.
2. **Lieutenant Carter and Specialist Park** will target the storage bunker and plant explosives to destroy the narcotics inventory.
3. Once the primary objectives are completed, the team will regroup and move to the extraction point. Timed coordination will be critical.”

Rena raised an eyebrow. “Wait, you want me on the ground? Who’s flying the Wraith?”

“I will maintain control of the Wraith remotely,” Hermes replied. “Its cloaking and evasion systems are fully operational without manual input. Your expertise is better utilized in the field.”

Rena sighed but nodded. “Fair enough. I’ve been itching to get in on the action anyway.”

---

#### Addressing Risks  

James crossed his arms. “What’s our biggest risk here?”

Hermes shifted the display to a map of the surrounding area. “The primary risk is reinforcements. The nearest IRGC garrison is twenty kilometers away. If they are alerted, they could arrive within fifteen minutes. Speed and precision are paramount.”

Olivia leaned back, her fingers tapping her console. “What about backup power? Can they recover quickly if we take out the hub?”

“Unlikely,” Hermes said. “The power hub is a single point of failure. However, they may attempt to secure critical assets and evacuate personnel. Swift action will prevent this.”

Tomas smirked. “In and out before they even know we’re there. Sounds like my kind of party.”

---

#### Final Preparations  

James looked around at the team, his expression serious. “This is it. We’ve got one shot to take this place down and cripple their operation. Stick to the plan, cover your sectors, and move fast. No mistakes.”

The team nodded, their resolve clear.

“Hermes,” James said, his voice firm, “keep us updated on comms and manage the Wraith. We’ll need every advantage you can give us.”

“Understood, Captain,” Hermes replied. “Good luck. The countdown begins now.”

The Wraith shifted position, moving into its designated holding pattern as the team began gearing up for the assault. The clock was ticking, and the fate of the operation hung on their ability to execute with precision and speed.

### The Assault Begins  

The Wraith hovered silently above the rugged terrain, cloaked and invisible against the night sky. Below, the factory loomed in the valley—a cluster of boxy, dimly lit structures surrounded by a tall chain-link fence topped with razor wire. The faint glow of security lights illuminated guard towers and patrolling figures, their movements methodical but relaxed.  

Inside the Wraith, the team finalized their preparations. The operations center was dimly lit, its soft blue glow reflecting off the polished black of their gear. Each member carried a compact loadout designed for stealth and speed.  

Hermes’s calm voice broke the silence. “We are approaching the insertion point. EWAR systems are online and fully operational. Beginning disruption of the factory’s surveillance network.”  

---

#### Disabling the Perimeter  

Hermes’s efforts were invisible but devastating. High above, the Wraith’s electronic warfare suite emitted targeted bursts of interference, blinding the factory’s cameras and jamming the guards’ radios.  

“Surveillance systems offline,” Hermes reported. “Guards are switching to local communication. I have intercepted their frequency and will monitor for any signs of suspicion.”  

James nodded, his expression grim. “Let’s move.”  

The ramp lowered with a faint hiss, and the team descended into the darkness below. The air was cold and still, carrying the faint hum of the factory’s distant machinery. The terrain was uneven, rocky outcroppings and sparse shrubs providing natural cover as they approached the facility’s eastern perimeter.  

---

#### Breaching the Perimeter  

“Fence ahead,” Tomas whispered, his voice barely audible over the faint rustling of the wind.  

Olivia knelt near the chain-link barrier, pulling a compact cutting tool from her pack. The device hummed softly as it sliced through the metal with precision, creating a silent opening large enough for the team to pass through.  

“Breach complete,” Olivia murmured, stepping through and scanning the area with her weapon raised.  

The team moved in single file, their movements smooth and silent. The factory’s eastern side was poorly lit, with a narrow alley running between the outer fence and a row of storage containers.  

“Clear so far,” Tomas muttered, his rifle sweeping the area.  

---

#### Inside the Perimeter  

Hermes’s voice came through their earpieces, calm and steady. “You are inside the perimeter. Proceed to your objectives. Patrols are currently focused near the southern entrance and central courtyard. I will guide you around them.”  

James raised a hand, signaling the team to split. “Tomas, you’re with me. We’ll handle the power hub. Rena, Olivia—get to the storage bunker and plant those charges. Move fast, but stay quiet.”  

Rena gave him a quick nod, her expression determined. “We’ll handle it.”  

Olivia checked her pack, ensuring the explosives were secure. “Hermes, keep us updated on guard positions.”  

“Understood,” Hermes replied. “I will provide real-time guidance. Good luck.”  

The team separated, moving like shadows through the dimly lit compound. The tension in the air was palpable, each step bringing them closer to their targets.  

---

#### Rena and Olivia: Approaching the Storage Bunker  

Rena and Olivia slipped between two rows of storage containers, their steps carefully measured to avoid making noise on the gravel. Ahead, the storage bunker loomed—a squat, reinforced structure with heavy metal doors and a single floodlight illuminating the entrance.  

“Two guards,” Hermes whispered in their earpieces. “Currently stationary. Thermal imaging suggests minimal activity inside the bunker.”  

Rena raised an eyebrow. “Think we can take them quietly?”  

Olivia’s lips curled into a faint smirk. “I’ll handle the one on the left. You take the right. Ready?”  

“Go,” Rena said, her voice steady.  

The two moved in unison, their footsteps soft and deliberate. Olivia reached her target first, a quick jab with her shock baton dropping the man before he could react. Rena followed suit, her takedown equally swift.  

“Guards neutralized,” Olivia reported.  

“Proceeding,” Hermes replied. “The bunker’s lock is electronic. I will override it now.”  

The heavy doors emitted a faint click as the lock disengaged. Rena pulled the door open just enough for them to slip inside.  

---

#### James and Tomas: Heading for the Power Hub  

Meanwhile, James and Tomas navigated the narrow alleys between the factory’s main buildings, guided by Hermes’s precise directions. The power hub was a freestanding structure near the center of the compound, surrounded by a chain-link enclosure and protected by a keypad lock.  

“Two guards patrolling the area,” Hermes noted. “They are approaching the eastern side of the hub. Take cover now.”  

James motioned for Tomas to duck behind a stack of pallets. They crouched in silence as the guards passed, their muted conversation fading into the distance.  

“Clear,” Hermes said. “Proceed to the hub.”  

James and Tomas moved swiftly to the enclosure. Tomas knelt near the keypad, pulling a small hacking device from his vest.  

“This’ll take a minute,” Tomas murmured, connecting the device.  

“Hermes, keep an eye on those patrols,” James said, his rifle scanning the area.  

“Understood, Captain,” Hermes replied. “You have approximately ninety seconds before the next patrol circles back.”  

### Planting the Charges  

#### Rena and Olivia: Inside the Storage Bunker  

The air inside the bunker was cold and heavy with the faint scent of chemicals. Dim, flickering overhead lights revealed rows of stacked crates, each marked with nondescript labels in Farsi. Olivia scanned the inventory, her sharp eyes catching the faint glint of metallic seals on some containers.  

“This is it,” Olivia murmured, pulling a small remote-controlled charge from her pack. She knelt beside the nearest stack of crates, carefully attaching the device to the container’s side.  

Rena moved to another row, following suit. “How many are we planting?” she asked, her voice low.  

“Three should be enough to take out the whole inventory,” Olivia replied, attaching a second charge. “This place is packed with volatile chemicals. One good chain reaction, and it’s all gone.”  

Hermes’s voice came softly through their earpieces. “I detect no additional personnel approaching your location. You have approximately three minutes before the next patrol passes within audible range of the bunker.”  

“Got it,” Rena said, her movements quick and efficient as she secured the final charge near the center of the room.  

Olivia straightened, checking her detonator. “Charges armed and synced. Let’s get out of here.”  

The two women moved back to the door, careful not to disturb the unconscious guards outside. Rena eased the heavy door shut, ensuring it wouldn’t draw attention, then followed Olivia back toward the rendezvous point.  

---

#### James and Tomas: At the Power Hub  

At the power hub, Tomas’s hacking device beeped softly as the keypad lock disengaged. He glanced up at James, a faint grin on his face. “We’re in.”  

“Good,” James said, scanning the area. “Hermes, status on the patrol?”  

“They remain unaware of your presence,” Hermes replied. “However, I detect increased radio chatter from the southern checkpoint. They may have noticed irregularities in their surveillance systems.”  

James frowned. “We’ll need to move fast. Tomas, let’s prep the charges.”  

The two slipped inside the power hub, a compact building humming with the steady drone of machinery. A control panel dominated one wall, while rows of circuit breakers and high-voltage transformers filled the rest of the space.  

Tomas pulled out a pair of remote-controlled charges, placing them carefully on the main power conduits. “These should fry the whole system when they go off,” he said, glancing back at James.  

“Set and ready?” James asked.  

“Good to go,” Tomas replied.  

---

#### Rena and Olivia: Regrouping  

Rena and Olivia emerged from the shadows near the hub, moving quickly but quietly. Rena tapped her earpiece. “We’re clear. Charges are set in the bunker. Heading to your position now.”  

James responded, his tone brisk. “Copy that. We’ve just placed the charges in the hub. Meet us by the east wall.”  

The two women navigated the maze of alleys and storage containers, their weapons ready as they passed through the darkened compound. The distant hum of machinery masked their footsteps, and the faint glow of security lights cast long, eerie shadows.  

They spotted James and Tomas waiting near the hub’s entrance, their dark silhouettes blending into the dim light. Rena and Olivia joined them, crouching low behind a stack of pallets.  

“All clear,” Rena whispered.  

“Good,” James said, his voice steady. “Hermes, status on the patrols?”  

“They are closing in on the storage bunker and the hub,” Hermes replied. “You have a limited window to execute your objectives before reinforcements are alerted.”  

James nodded, his focus sharp. “We move now. Time to make some noise.”  

### Scene 13 (Continued): Compromise  

The team was moving quickly to finish their objectives, slipping through the darkened factory compound with practiced ease. James Westin led the way toward the eastern wall, where the Wraith would be waiting for their extraction once the charges were detonated.  

“Patrols are tightening their routes,” Hermes warned through their earpieces. “It appears they are compensating for the irregularities caused by the EWAR systems.”  

“We’ll be out before they get a clue,” James muttered, glancing back to ensure the others were following.  

But then it happened—a sound that shouldn’t have been there.  

---

#### The Mistake  

As the team skirted the perimeter near a guard station, Tomas Finch shifted his footing to avoid a loose piece of debris. His boot struck a metal pipe lying hidden in the shadow, the clang echoing faintly but unmistakably in the still air.  

“Who’s there?” a guard barked in Farsi, flashlight beams suddenly cutting through the darkness.  

“Move!” James hissed, motioning the team toward the power hub.  

The guards advanced cautiously, their voices escalating as they radioed the compound.  

“This is not good,” Olivia muttered, clutching her rifle as they sprinted back toward the hub.  

Hermes’s voice was sharp in their comms. “Alert levels are rising. Hostile forces converging on your position.”  

---

#### Barricading in the Power Hub  

The team burst into the power hub, Tomas slamming the door shut behind them. James quickly scanned the room, spotting a metal cabinet and a stack of heavy crates.  

“Barricade it,” he ordered.  

Tomas and Rena pushed the crates against the door as Olivia moved to cover the windows. Outside, voices shouted orders, and the crunch of boots on gravel grew louder.  

“Westin, they’re mobilizing,” Hermes said. “Enemy reinforcements are estimated to arrive in five minutes. Your current position is indefensible.”  

“No kidding,” Rena snapped, her voice tense.  

James gritted his teeth, pacing as he weighed their options. “Can we exfil to another location on foot?”  

“Negative,” Hermes replied. “Patrol routes now overlap the entire perimeter. Your escape on foot is highly improbable.”  

---

#### The Pressure Mounts  

A loud thud reverberated through the barricaded door as the guards outside tested it.  

“They know we’re in here,” Tomas said grimly.  

James checked his weapon, his face set in a determined grimace. “We can hold them off until the Wraith gets closer.”  

Hermes’s voice cut through the tension, its tone sharper than usual. “Captain Westin, your situation is untenable. You *need* to authorize direct engagement.”  

James froze for a moment, the weight of the decision clear on his face. The team’s plan had relied on stealth, on avoiding direct confrontation with the IRGC forces. Going loud would be a drastic shift—and a dangerous one.  

The door thudded again, louder this time. Olivia glanced at James. “We can’t hold this for long.”  

James bit his lip, his mind racing. Finally, he nodded. “Okay, you’re right. Go loud. Get us outta here!”  

Hermes responded instantly, his voice steady and assured. “Affirmative. Stand by, ETA 30 seconds.”  

### The Wraith Unleashed  

The thudding against the power hub’s door grew louder, the shouting of guards outside blending with the clatter of approaching reinforcements. Inside, the team prepared for a last stand, their weapons trained on the barricade.  

James Westin adjusted his grip on his rifle, his expression tense. “Hermes, you better not be late.”  

Hermes’s voice came calmly through their earpieces. “The Wraith is approaching the target zone. Direct engagement begins now.”  

---

#### The Convoy’s Demise  

In the distance, a column of IRGC trucks raced toward the compound, their headlights piercing the darkness as they kicked up clouds of dust. The Wraith appeared above them like a ghost, its cloaked form briefly shimmering as it adjusted its altitude.  

With surgical precision, two dorsal panels slid open, revealing compact missile pods. The launch was nearly silent, the missiles streaking toward the convoy with deadly accuracy.  

The first missile struck the lead truck, detonating in a brilliant flash that flipped the vehicle into the air, scattering debris across the road. The second missile found its mark in the middle of the column, its explosion sending a fireball roaring through the tightly packed convoy.  

The surviving trucks screeched to a halt, their occupants scrambling for cover. Before they could react, the Wraith fired again, its third and fourth missiles obliterating the remaining vehicles.  

---

#### Systematic Destruction  

As the convoy burned in the distance, the Wraith turned its attention to the compound. Gliding over the facility with eerie silence, it deployed its forward plasma cannons. From the cockpit, Hermes orchestrated every shot with surgical precision.  

“Commencing ground suppression,” Hermes said.  

A series of guards rushed toward the power hub, weapons ready. The Wraith’s cannons swiveled and fired, sending searing blue plasma bolts streaking through the air. The first bolt struck the ground near the guards, throwing them off their feet with the force of the explosion. A second and third shot followed, vaporizing their cover and neutralizing them instantly.  

The guards near the barracks tried to mount a coordinated defense, setting up a machine gun on a rooftop. The Wraith’s targeting system identified the threat in milliseconds. A concentrated burst from the plasma cannons reduced the rooftop and its occupants to smoldering rubble.  

Inside the power hub, the team felt the ground tremble with each blast. Rena glanced at James. “I’d hate to be on the receiving end of this thing.”  

James smirked faintly. “That’s why we’re in here.”  

---

#### The Extraction  

The Wraith hovered over the compound, its ramp lowering as it positioned itself just outside the power hub. Hermes’s voice came through their comms. “Extraction point secured. Move quickly.”  

James gestured toward the door. “Tomas, get that barricade down. Rena, Olivia, cover him.”  

Tomas shoved the crates aside, and James kicked the door open. The team sprinted into the open, weapons ready as they moved toward the waiting Wraith.  

A squad of guards rounded a corner, rifles raised, but the Wraith’s plasma cannons fired first, cutting them down with pinpoint accuracy. The ground around the guards erupted in flames, forcing others to retreat in panic.  

The team boarded the ramp one by one, their movements quick and precise. James was the last to climb aboard, his rifle sweeping for any last-minute threats.  

“We’re in!” he shouted. “Hermes, get us out of here!”  

“Understood, Captain,” Hermes replied. “Initiating full engagement.”  

---

#### Total Annihilation  

As the ramp closed, the Wraith ascended, its plasma cannons swiveling to target the factory. With the team safely aboard, Hermes unleashed the craft’s full arsenal.  

“Commencing facility destruction,” Hermes said.  

The plasma cannons fired in a relentless barrage, targeting the storage bunker first. The charges Olivia and Rena had planted detonated as the plasma bolts struck, igniting the volatile chemicals inside. The resulting explosion tore through the compound, sending a massive fireball into the night sky.  

Hermes directed the cannons toward the barracks next, reducing them to rubble with a sustained burst of fire. The power hub followed, its transformers erupting in showers of sparks as the Wraith’s weapons ripped through it.  

For the final blow, Hermes deployed a pair of dorsal missiles, targeting the central factory structure. The missiles struck with devastating force, leveling the building and sending debris raining down across the compound.  

Inside the Wraith, the team watched the destruction on the holographic display. Tomas let out a low whistle. “Remind me never to piss you off, Hermes.”  

Rena grinned, leaning back in her seat. “Mission accomplished.”  

James crossed his arms, his expression grim but satisfied. “Let’s get out of here before they figure out what hit them.”  

The Wraith rose higher, its engines humming as it disappeared into the night, leaving nothing behind but smoke, fire, and the shattered remains of the IRGC’s narcotics operation.  

### Return to Langley  

The Wraith cut through the upper atmosphere on its way back to the United States, the faint hum of its engines a constant backdrop to the subdued operations center. The team sat around the holographic table, its display showing a live feed of their flight path. Colonel Rezaei and Karami were secured in their respective holding cells, their defiant glares replaced by silence during the long journey.

Rena Carter leaned back in her chair, rubbing the back of her neck as she broke the silence. “Well. That was scary. And I don’t mean the guards, I mean what Hermes wrought on them.”  

“That’s putting it mildly,” Olivia Park replied, her tone carrying a mix of awe and unease. “That was like watching a symphony of destruction.”  

Tomas Finch smirked, folding his arms. “You’re telling me. I didn’t even know plasma cannons could hit that precisely.”  

James Westin, who had been quietly observing the flight map, joined the conversation. “I’ve seen airstrikes before, and this was **not** one of them. This was… precise and efficient, not blunt like our old airstrikes.” He glanced toward the ceiling, as though addressing the Wraith’s omnipresent AI. “Hermes, remind me never to be on your bad side.”  

Hermes’s calm voice responded over the speakers. “Captain, my actions are dictated by mission objectives. You have nothing to fear so long as we share a common purpose.”  

Rena rolled her eyes, a faint grin tugging at her lips. “Reassuring. Thanks, Hermes.”

#### Reflecting on the Mission  

The mood grew more reflective as the adrenaline of the mission faded. Olivia leaned forward, her fingers brushing the edge of the table. “It’s hard to believe we pulled that off. The factory, the convoy, the reinforcements… we dismantled their entire operation in one night.”  

“And with minimal collateral damage,” James added. “It’s the kind of mission that would’ve taken weeks with traditional assets. But the Wraith changed the game.”  

Tomas nodded. “Sure, but we’re lucky things didn’t go worse. If we hadn’t had Hermes, we’d still be pinned down in that power hub.”  

“That’s the truth,” Rena agreed. “I still can’t get over how fast the Wraith neutralized those threats. One second, we’re surrounded, and the next… nothing but silence.”  

The room fell quiet for a moment, each member of the team replaying the night’s events in their minds.  

---

#### The Final Stretch  

Hermes broke the silence, his voice calm but firm. “We are nearing U.S. airspace. Langley has been informed of our arrival. The captives will be transferred to CIA custody upon landing.”  

James stood, his gaze sweeping over the team. “Let’s make sure everything’s squared away before we land. Rena, Olivia, double-check the restraints on our guests. Tomas, inventory the gear. We’ll need a full debrief as soon as we’re on the ground.”  

“Got it,” Rena said, rising to her feet.  

“On it,” Tomas replied, moving toward the storage lockers.  

---

#### Landing at Langley  

The Wraith descended smoothly over the quiet Virginia countryside, its stealth systems disengaging as it approached Langley’s secure airstrip. The team stood near the ramp, their expressions weary but resolute. Outside, a contingent of CIA operatives waited with unmarked vehicles to receive the captives.  

As the ramp lowered, James turned to the team. “Good work out there. We’ll debrief and regroup tomorrow. For now, let’s hand these two over and get some rest.”  

The team disembarked as the CIA agents moved in, efficiently transferring the prisoners and their data. The Wraith powered down, its role in the mission complete—for now.  

The team walked away from the craft, their steps heavy with exhaustion but their spirits buoyed by success. Behind them, the sleek shadow of the Wraith loomed silently, a reminder of the precision and power they now carried into the shadows.  

### Debriefing, Part I  

The conference room in Langley’s secure operations wing was stark and utilitarian, its walls lined with monitors displaying maps, tactical data, and key images from the mission. Captain James Westin and his team sat at the table’s center, their expressions a mix of professionalism and fatigue. Across from them was the operations commander, a sharp-eyed woman in her late fifties with graying hair tied neatly back. Next to her sat Alicia Monroe, her presence quiet but observant as she sipped from a cup of coffee.  

In the corner of the room, a holographic display flickered to life, projecting a translucent representation of Hermes’s wireframe avatar—a simplified humanoid figure composed of intersecting lines of light.  

“Thank you for convening,” the operations commander began, her tone crisp. “This debrief is critical to understanding the effectiveness of the Wraith platform and its integration with your team. We’ll proceed chronologically, starting with the operation’s entry phase. Captain Westin, the floor is yours.”  

---

#### Arrival into Iran  

James leaned forward, his hands resting on the table. “We began with a stealth insertion into Northern Iran, relying on the Wraith’s advanced cloaking systems and EWAR capabilities to avoid detection. The craft’s phased refractive array kept us visually concealed, and Hermes’s suppression of electromagnetic and thermal signatures ensured no alarms were triggered. We landed in a secluded area near the initial target zone without incident.”  

The operations commander nodded. “Hermes, how would you evaluate the Wraith’s performance during this phase?”  

Hermes’s voice was calm and measured. “The Wraith performed optimally, maintaining full-spectrum stealth throughout the flight and landing. No radar pings or thermal anomalies were detected. Additionally, the EWAR suite suppressed local surveillance networks, ensuring our presence remained undetected.”  

Alicia glanced at Hermes’s avatar. “How close were you to tripping any alerts?”  

“Not close,” Hermes replied smoothly. “The IRGC’s regional surveillance systems are outdated compared to Federation technology. Their coverage relies heavily on fixed installations, which were bypassed with precision.”  

---

#### Locating Davood Karami  

James continued, glancing briefly at the holographic map projected in the center of the table. “Once on the ground, we deployed reconnaissance drones to confirm the location of our first target: the narcotics distribution hub. Olivia managed the drone operations while Tomas secured the perimeter.”  

Olivia nodded, pulling up a feed from the mission on her tablet, which projected onto the central screen. The video showed the drones sweeping over the compound, their thermal imaging revealing movement patterns.  

“This was the first sweep,” Olivia explained. “We used thermal and optical sensors to pinpoint personnel and activity. The drones identified Davood Karami at the center of the compound, interacting with the guards and overseeing what appeared to be shipment preparations.”  

The screen zoomed in on a heat signature overlay of Karami, his distinct build and movements captured clearly.  

Alicia leaned forward. “That’s incredibly precise. Hermes, how did you confirm his identity?”  

Hermes’s avatar flickered slightly as he spoke. “I cross-referenced the drone’s visual data with biometric profiles and behavioral patterns obtained from Federation databases. Facial recognition was successful within 2.7 seconds, confirming the target’s identity with a 99.4% confidence rate.”  

The operations commander raised an eyebrow. “Impressive. Captain, what challenges did you encounter during this phase?”  

James hesitated, glancing at Olivia. “The drones performed flawlessly, but we had to ensure they didn’t get too close to avoid triggering the compound’s basic surveillance systems. Hermes’s EWAR mitigated most risks, but it required constant monitoring on Olivia’s end to avoid gaps in coverage.”  

Olivia shrugged modestly. “It wasn’t too bad. The drones’ autonomy helps a lot. Hermes handles most of the subroutines, so I just have to adjust for situational variables.”  

---

#### Tactical Analysis  

The operations commander turned to Alicia. “Ms. Monroe, any observations?”  

Alicia tapped her pen on the table thoughtfully. “This phase was surgical. Using the Wraith and Hermes allowed for unparalleled precision in identifying the target without engaging or alerting hostiles. It’s the kind of operation that would’ve taken hours—maybe days—with conventional assets, assuming it was even possible.”  

Hermes added, “The combination of drone surveillance and EWAR systems ensures minimal risk during initial reconnaissance. However, prolonged deployments increase the likelihood of detection as adversaries adapt to irregularities in their systems.”  

The commander nodded. “Noted. Captain, anything else to add?”  

James shook his head. “No, ma’am. This phase went exactly as planned. It set the tone for the rest of the mission.”  

The operations commander made a note on her tablet. “Very well. We’ll move to the next phase—disrupting the convoy and capturing Karami—after a short break.”  

The team relaxed slightly, but the weight of the mission’s remaining details hung in the air as they prepared to dissect the more dangerous parts of their operation.  

### Scene 16 (Continued): Debriefing, Part II  

After a brief pause, the team reconvened in the conference room, ready to delve into the next phase of their operation. The holographic display refreshed, now showing images and video feeds from the convoy interception and subsequent interrogation of Davood Karami.  

The operations commander gestured to James Westin. “Captain, let’s continue. Tell us about the convoy interception.”  

---

#### The Convoy Ambush  

James leaned forward, tapping a control to bring up the holographic map of the convoy’s route. Marked along the winding mountain road were points indicating the ambush site and the IRGC convoy’s position at the time of engagement.  

“We identified the convoy as the primary means of moving narcotics and shielded assets between hubs,” James began. “The Wraith’s drones tracked the convoy as it approached a choke point we identified during recon—a sharp curve in the road with dense terrain on both sides.”  

He gestured toward the map. “Olivia planted a remote-controlled spike strip to disable the vehicles, while Tomas and I positioned ourselves to neutralize the guards. The EMP system onboard the Wraith played a key role in ensuring a clean takedown by disabling the vehicles’ electronics without causing unnecessary damage.”  

Olivia interjected, a faint grin on her face. “It was textbook. The EMP took out the engines, lights, and radios, and the guards didn’t even realize what hit them. By the time they figured out what was happening, we were already moving in.”  

The holographic display shifted to show footage from a drone feed: the vehicles grinding to a halt as their engines failed, followed by the team moving into position.  

“Tomas neutralized the lead vehicle,” James continued. “Olivia and I handled the guards around the SUV and rear truck. Rena provided overwatch from the Wraith, ensuring we had drone coverage in case of unexpected reinforcements. Within minutes, the guards were down, and we had Karami in custody.”  

---

#### Interrogating Karami  

The display switched to the interior of the Wraith, showing Karami seated in the holding cell, his initial defiance clear in his body language. James nodded toward the image. “The interrogation phase was critical. Karami was our only link to identifying the hubs and the network’s operational leadership.”  

James turned to Hermes’s holographic avatar. “Hermes played a central role in ensuring the interrogation’s success. By monitoring Karami’s vitals—heart rate, stress levels, and vocal patterns—Hermes provided real-time feedback on his reactions to our questions.”  

Hermes’s voice was calm and measured. “My analysis identified key moments when Karami’s stress levels spiked, indicating attempts at deception or evasion. This allowed Captain Westin and the team to fine-tune their approach, applying pressure where necessary to elicit truthful responses.”  

The operations commander raised an eyebrow. “You mean Hermes was essentially guiding the interrogation?”  

James nodded. “Exactly. Hermes’s input was the difference between blindly pushing for answers and knowing when we had him on the ropes. For example, when Karami claimed ignorance about the narcotics routes, Hermes flagged it as a likely lie based on his elevated stress levels. That let us shift tactics and force a breakthrough.”  

---

#### Spoofing the Colonel’s Call  

Alicia leaned forward, her expression curious. “What about the call from Colonel Rezaei? That’s not the kind of thing you can plan for.”  

James smirked faintly. “That was Hermes’s moment to shine. When the Colonel unexpectedly called Karami’s phone, Hermes intercepted the call and used voice synthesis to imitate Karami perfectly. It bought us the time we needed to confirm our next move.”  

Hermes’s avatar flickered as he spoke. “Using audio captured during the interrogation, I constructed a vocal profile of Davood Karami. This allowed me to replicate his voice with sufficient accuracy to deceive Colonel Rezaei during the call. I also suggested an alternate route for the Colonel’s visit to the Rasht hub, positioning him for an ambush while maintaining operational cover.”  

The operations commander looked impressed. “A bold move. What was the Colonel’s reaction?”  

“He didn’t suspect a thing,” James said. “Hermes handled the entire exchange smoothly. The Colonel followed the suggested route, which led directly into our ambush. Without that call, capturing him would have been far more difficult.”  

---

#### Tactical Lessons  

The operations commander tapped her pen against her tablet, making a note. “It seems the Wraith and Hermes were instrumental in both phases. What’s your assessment of their overall impact?”  

James considered the question for a moment. “The Wraith’s capabilities turned what could’ve been a chaotic and dangerous operation into a surgical strike. From recon to engagement to interrogation, it gave us an unprecedented level of control. And Hermes… well, let’s just say I wouldn’t want to interrogate anyone without him again.”  

Alicia added, “This kind of precision is what we’ve been missing in operations like this. Hermes’s ability to adapt to unexpected developments is a game changer.”  

The operations commander nodded, her expression thoughtful. “Understood. We’ll move on to the Colonel’s capture and the final phase of the mission shortly. Let’s take a five-minute break.”  

The team exchanged glances, the weight of the discussion evident on their faces as they prepared to delve into the next—and most critical—parts of the mission.  

### Scene 16 (Continued): Debriefing, Part III  

The operations commander gestured for the team to continue, her pen poised over her tablet. “Let’s move on to the ambush on Colonel Rezaei’s convoy. Captain Westin, walk us through it.”

The holographic display shifted, showing a tactical map of the ambush site—a winding forest road flanked by dense trees and rocky outcroppings. Video feeds from drones captured key moments, overlaid with telemetry data from the Wraith.  

---

#### Setting the Trap  

James Westin nodded, his voice calm but firm. “After Hermes spoofed Karami’s voice to redirect the Colonel’s convoy, we had a narrow window to set up the ambush. The site was chosen for its natural choke points—sharp turns and dense foliage made it ideal for trapping vehicles with limited avenues for escape.”  

He gestured to the map. “Tomas and I positioned ourselves near the lead vehicle, while Olivia handled the spike strip deployment. Rena remained aboard the Wraith, providing overwatch with the drones.”  

Alicia Monroe leaned forward, her curiosity evident. “How crucial was the Wraith’s role in that setup?”  

James smirked faintly. “Critical. The drones provided real-time updates on the convoy’s position, while the Wraith’s EWAR systems suppressed any outgoing signals. By the time the convoy realized something was wrong, we’d already disabled their comms and engines with an EMP strike.”  

---

#### The Ambush  

The holographic display switched to a drone feed of the convoy grinding to a halt as the EMP disabled the vehicles. Guards spilled out, disoriented and scrambling for cover as the team moved into position.  

“Once the EMP hit,” James continued, “we moved in fast. Tomas neutralized the guards around the lead vehicle, while Olivia disabled the SUV’s tires with precision fire. I took the rear truck, ensuring no one could use it for escape.”  

Tomas chuckled, leaning back in his chair. “They didn’t know what hit ’em. By the time they started shooting, most of them were already on the ground.”  

The operations commander raised an eyebrow. “Any resistance?”  

“Minimal,” Olivia replied, tapping her tablet to highlight one segment of the footage. “There were a few guards who tried to regroup, but the Wraith’s drones tracked their movements. Rena directed a drone to drop a stun charge, neutralizing them without giving away our presence.”  

Hermes’s voice chimed in. “The operational efficiency of the team ensured the engagement was resolved within 84 seconds. All objectives were achieved with no significant risks to personnel.”  

---

#### Capturing Rezaei  

The display shifted again, this time showing a thermal feed of the Colonel being dragged from his SUV. His silhouette was highlighted in red, surrounded by the team.  

“Rezaei put up more resistance than I expected,” James said, his tone darkening. “He tried to reach for a weapon, but Olivia disarmed him before he could escalate the situation.”  

The image froze on a close-up of Rezaei, his expression defiant.  

The operations commander frowned. “He looks like he didn’t go quietly.”  

“He didn’t,” Olivia said. “But we secured him without injury and ensured he couldn’t alert reinforcements.”  

Alicia tilted her head. “And his guards?”  

“Neutralized,” Tomas said. “Non-lethal takedowns for most, but a few were injured when the EMP destabilized the vehicles. We left no one in a condition to pursue us.”  

---

#### Interrogating the Colonel  

The final segment of the display showed Rezaei restrained in the Wraith’s holding cell, his posture stiff with suppressed rage. James gestured toward the image.  

“Rezaei was harder to crack than Karami. He’s loyal to the IRGC, and he’s got years of experience dealing with pressure. But Hermes was instrumental in breaking through his defenses.”  

The operations commander leaned forward, intrigued. “How so?”  

“By monitoring his stress levels and vocal patterns, Hermes could tell when he was lying or evading questions,” James explained. “That allowed us to adjust our approach—escalating pressure when he resisted and easing off when he started to falter.”  

Hermes’s voice added context. “Colonel Rezaei displayed significant resistance during the initial phases of the interrogation. However, by presenting him with fabricated evidence of IRGC collapse—simulated through controlled communications—I increased his perception of personal risk. This psychological manipulation resulted in the desired cooperation.”  

Alicia smirked faintly. “So Hermes bluffed him into spilling everything?”  

“Exactly,” James said. “We didn’t give him time to regroup mentally. Once he started talking, he confirmed the location of the main narcotics factory near Rudbar, along with key operational details about its defenses and personnel.”  

The operations commander nodded, her pen flying over her tablet. “The intel from Rezaei proved critical. Without him, would you have been able to locate and neutralize the factory?”  

“Unlikely,” James admitted. “The factory was well-hidden, and its security measures were more advanced than we anticipated. Rezaei gave us everything we needed to plan the strike.”  

---

#### Tactical Lessons  

Alicia tapped her chin thoughtfully. “This phase really shows the value of Hermes. Without the Wraith’s AI managing the interrogation, monitoring Rezaei, and fabricating those communications, this could’ve dragged on for hours—or failed entirely.”  

“Agreed,” the operations commander said. “Captain, what would you say was the most significant takeaway from this phase?”  

James didn’t hesitate. “Adaptability. The mission didn’t go perfectly, but Hermes’s ability to improvise—from spoofing Karami’s voice to bluffing Rezaei—kept us ahead of the IRGC at every turn. Without that, we wouldn’t have made it out clean.”  

The commander nodded, satisfied. “Noted. Let’s move on to the final phase: the factory assault. We’ll take another short break before continuing.”  

The team relaxed slightly, though the tension of recounting their high-stakes operation lingered in the air.  

### Scene 16 (Continued): Debriefing, Part IV  

The operations commander leaned forward as the next segment of the mission came into focus. On the holographic display, the factory compound near Rudbar appeared, overlaid with markers indicating patrol routes, security emplacements, and critical infrastructure. The team’s insertion path, drawn in faint blue, snaked through the compound’s eastern side.  

“Let’s discuss the factory infiltration,” the commander said. “Captain, walk us through the approach.”  

---

#### Racing Against the Clock  

James Westin adjusted his posture, his expression resolute. “The factory assault was a race against time. By the time we extracted intel from Colonel Rezaei, we knew we had a narrow window before his absence was noticed. With minimal time to plan, we left the bulk of the strategy to Hermes while we prepped en route.”  

He gestured to the holographic display, which shifted to show the Wraith’s approach path. “The Wraith’s EWAR systems suppressed local surveillance and intercepted IRGC comms as we moved in. Hermes optimized the infiltration route based on live drone reconnaissance. That allowed us to avoid patrols and focus on neutralizing key objectives.”  

Alicia Monroe raised an eyebrow. “How much of the planning was done in real time?”  

“All of it,” James admitted. “Hermes analyzed the compound layout and provided an insertion plan while we were still in the air. By the time we landed, we had a clear path and knew exactly where to start.”  

---

#### Hermes’s Role  

The operations commander glanced at Hermes’s wireframe avatar. “Hermes, explain how you optimized the infiltration route.”  

Hermes’s voice was calm and precise. “The compound’s eastern side exhibited reduced coverage due to natural terrain obstacles and overlapping blind spots in the security camera network. Using drone reconnaissance, I identified guard patrol patterns and timed their movements to allow for safe passage through the perimeter.  

“The plan required constant updates as new variables arose,” Hermes continued. “For example, a late-shift patrol deviated from its normal route, requiring an adjustment to the team’s path to avoid detection. This level of dynamic planning ensured minimal exposure.”  

Alicia smirked faintly. “And you just trust Hermes with those adjustments?”  

James nodded. “We didn’t have a choice. The Wraith and Hermes gave us more information than we could’ve processed on our own, especially under those time constraints. We trusted the system, and it delivered.”  

---

#### Infiltrating the Compound  

The holographic display shifted to a series of drone feeds, showing the team moving silently through the shadows of the factory compound. Each member was marked with a faint blue overlay, while guards and security measures were highlighted in red.  

“We entered the compound via the eastern perimeter,” James said. “Olivia cut through the fence while Tomas secured the area, ensuring no patrols were nearby. From there, Hermes guided us toward our objectives: the power hub and the storage bunker.”  

Olivia tapped her tablet, pulling up a freeze-frame of the team near the fence. “This part went smoothly. Hermes timed the patrols down to the second, and we slipped through without raising any suspicion. The guards didn’t even glance our way.”  

Tomas chuckled. “Yeah, it was almost too smooth. Felt like we were ghosts.”  

James’s expression darkened slightly. “Until we weren’t.”  

---

#### The Misstep  

The display shifted to show the team nearing a guard station, its faint glow casting long shadows across the compound. As the team moved cautiously along the narrow path, Tomas’s boot struck a loose metal pipe hidden in the darkness.  

The sound was faint but unmistakable, a sharp clang cutting through the still night.  

On the screen, two guards in the distance paused, their flashlights swinging toward the source of the noise.  

“Who’s there?” one of the guards called out, his voice cutting through the comm feed.  

Hermes’s calm voice broke into the conference room. “At this point, the guards initiated a localized search, raising the risk of exposure by 48%. Immediate evasive action was required to avoid escalating the situation further.”  

---

#### Tension in the Debrief  

The room fell silent as the feed froze on the moment the guards turned toward the sound. The operations commander studied the image for a long moment before speaking.  

“Captain, at this point, how did the team respond?”  

James exhaled slowly. “We made the only call we could: retreat to a defensible position. That’s when everything started unraveling.”  

### Scene 16 (Continued): Debriefing, Part V  

The holographic display remained frozen on the guards’ flashlights cutting through the darkness. The team sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the next part of their retelling evident in their expressions.  

The operations commander gestured for James to continue. “What happened next, Captain?”  

---

#### Pinned Down  

James leaned forward, his hands clasped in front of him. “The noise from the pipe alerted the guards, and we had no choice but to move. Hermes directed us to a fallback point—the power hub—since it was close and defensible. We knew reinforcements were a possibility, but it was the best option under the circumstances.”  

The holographic display shifted to show the team retreating into the power hub, flashlights and guards closing in behind them. James’s voice grew sharper as he recounted the moment. “Tomas and Rena secured the door while Olivia and I covered the windows. By the time we’d barricaded ourselves inside, the guards were already surrounding the building.”  

On the display, multiple red markers converged on the power hub, their positions based on Hermes’s analysis of guard movements. The tactical map painted a grim picture.  

“Within two minutes, the guards were fully mobilized,” James continued. “They didn’t breach immediately—probably waiting for reinforcements—but we were effectively pinned down.”  

---

#### Limited Options  

Tomas leaned back in his chair, his expression grim. “They had us dead to rights. One squad blocked the main exit while another circled the building, trying to find a way in. If they’d had heavier weapons, they could’ve torn the hub apart.”  

Olivia tapped the table, bringing up live footage from the mission. Guards with rifles surrounded the power hub, their flashlights sweeping across its windows and doors. “We were in a bad spot. No way to fight our way out without drawing the entire compound down on us.”  

The operations commander raised an eyebrow. “Was there any chance of slipping out without Hermes’s intervention?”  

“None,” James replied bluntly. “The compound was on high alert by then. Even if we’d managed to slip past the guards at the hub, the perimeter patrols were too tight for an unassisted escape.”  

---

#### The Ticking Clock  

Hermes’s voice filled the room, calm yet firm. “Hostile forces were increasing in number and coordination. Thermal imaging indicated additional personnel mobilizing from the barracks. The probability of successful extraction without intervention was less than 17%.”  

Rena, who had been silent until now, spoke up. “And that’s when Hermes laid it out for us. He said it straight: ‘Your situation is untenable.’”  

James nodded, his voice quiet but resolute. “Hermes was right. We didn’t have the firepower to hold them off, and we couldn’t risk waiting any longer. Reinforcements were already en route, and the factory would’ve locked down completely if we didn’t act fast.”  

---

#### Making the Call  

The display shifted to a freeze-frame of the team inside the power hub, their faces tense as they huddled near the barricaded door. The faint glow of their gear reflected the high-stakes urgency of the moment.  

James’s jaw tightened as he recounted the decision. “Hermes pushed for direct engagement. He made it clear that the only way out was to bring the Wraith into play.”  

The operations commander glanced at Hermes’s avatar. “And your assessment, Hermes?”  

“Direct engagement was the optimal course of action,” Hermes replied. “The Wraith’s advanced weapons systems were capable of neutralizing all threats with minimal collateral damage. Delaying would have significantly increased the risk of mission failure and team casualties.”  

The room fell silent as the holographic display lingered on James’s face.  

Westin finally spoke, his voice low. “I bit my lip, realizing Hermes was right. I didn’t like it, but there was no other choice. I gave the order.”  

The feed updated, showing the Wraith powering up from its hold position. James’s voice, captured from the mission comms, played over the speakers.  

“Okay, you’re right. Go loud. Get us outta here!”  

Hermes’s response followed immediately. “Affirmative. Stand by, ETA 30 seconds.”  

### Scene 16 (Continued): Debriefing, Part VI  

The room dimmed slightly as the holographic display transitioned to footage recorded from the Wraith’s sensors during its attack on the compound. The first view was a wide-angle perspective from one of the stealth drones, showing the factory compound as guards scrambled to respond to the growing chaos. Flashlights flickered across the darkened grounds, and distant shouts were faintly audible in the recording.

Hermes’s calm voice narrated the sequence. “This footage begins at the moment direct engagement was authorized. The Wraith initiated a rapid deployment from its hold position, targeting hostile reinforcements en route to the compound.”  

---

#### The Convoy’s Destruction  

The feed zoomed in on the reinforcement convoy, captured through the infrared lens of one of the Wraith’s dorsal missile pods. The thermal outlines of vehicles and personnel were stark against the cold terrain.  

“This is the first engagement,” Hermes explained.  

The missile launched without fanfare, a barely audible hum from the recording preceding the devastating impact. The lead vehicle exploded in a burst of heat and light, flipping into the air before landing in a crumpled heap. The camera smoothly transitioned to track the next missile, which struck the center of the convoy, scattering debris and flames across the road.  

Alicia Monroe flinched, her fingers tightening on the edge of the table. “Good God,” she whispered under her breath.  

The operations commander’s face remained impassive, though her eyes were locked on the display, unblinking.  

---

#### Suppression at the Compound  

The feed transitioned to a view of the compound itself, captured through the Wraith’s targeting sensors. Guards converged on the power hub, their movements frantic as they prepared to breach the barricaded building.  

“Plasma cannons engaged,” Hermes said, his tone clinical.  

The first cannon fired, the recording capturing the intense glow of the bolt as it streaked toward the ground. The blast vaporized a group of guards near the power hub’s entrance, leaving scorch marks and craters in its wake.  

Alicia visibly winced. The operations commander leaned forward, her expression hardening as the plasma cannons systematically dismantled guard positions, reducing barricades and vehicles to smoldering wreckage.  

“This next sequence demonstrates suppression of rooftop threats,” Hermes continued. The footage zoomed in on a guard setting up a machine gun on a rooftop. A burst from the Wraith’s plasma cannon obliterated the entire structure in a single shot, the debris collapsing inward as fire consumed it.  

---

#### Precision Firepower  

The footage shifted again, now showing the Wraith’s infrared overlay of the area surrounding the compound. It identified and tracked every hostile heat signature, targeting each with clinical precision. A series of smaller explosions illuminated the scene as drones deployed stun and incendiary charges, neutralizing groups of reinforcements attempting to flank the compound.  

The display paused briefly to highlight the timeline. Hermes’s voice filled the room again. “From the initiation of engagement to the neutralization of all hostiles, the total elapsed time was three minutes and twenty-two seconds.”  

---

#### The Final Strike  

The final segment of the footage showed the Wraith hovering above the compound, its plasma cannons and missile systems synchronized for maximum effect. The power hub, the barracks, and several key structures were obliterated in a synchronized barrage, each strike precisely timed to minimize overlap and ensure total destruction.  

The last image lingered on the factory’s main building, captured just as it erupted in a massive explosion, sending plumes of fire and debris skyward. The holographic display faded into darkness, leaving the room in silence.  

---

#### The Quiet Aftermath  

No one spoke. The hum of the display system shutting down filled the void as the team, Alicia, and the operations commander sat in stunned silence. The magnitude of the Wraith’s firepower and Hermes’s surgical precision weighed heavily in the room, unspoken but palpable.  

The holographic avatar of Hermes remained visible, standing motionless as if waiting for the next question.  

The silence stretched on, unbroken, as the room grappled with the sheer scale of destruction they had just witnessed.  

### Scene 16 (Continued): Debriefing, Part VII  

The silence in the room stretched for several moments after the holographic display dimmed. The weight of what they had seen hung in the air, a testament to the sheer power of the Wraith and Hermes’s surgical precision. Finally, it was James Westin who broke the quiet.

“Ma’am, I’ve seen airstrikes before,” he began, his voice firm but tinged with awe. “This was not just an airstrike. This was something else entirely. You know that saying, ‘the cavalry has arrived’? Well, Hermes **is** that proverbial cavalry.”  

The operations commander’s gaze snapped to him, sharp and questioning. “You’re saying this was different from conventional support? How so?”  

---

#### The Precision of Hermes  

James nodded, leaning forward slightly. “An airstrike is blunt. You call it in, and you hope it hits the target without hitting you in the process. There’s always a margin of error, no matter how good the targeting systems are. But this? With Hermes, there was no margin of error. It was precise, controlled—never once did I worry about friendly fire.”  

He gestured toward Hermes’s avatar, which stood calmly in the corner of the room. “Hermes, correct me if I’m wrong here, but we could have strolled out of that power hub while you were laying down hell, and not a hair on our head would have moved.”  

Hermes’s voice was steady, as if the AI were confirming a simple fact. “That is not inaccurate, Captain. If you were to walk out of the structure during the strike, you would have been walking through what is effectively a corridor of fire towards me. Anyone who so much as turns a rifle in your direction would be neutralized immediately.”

#### Reflections on Firepower  

The operations commander frowned slightly, her pen tapping rhythmically against her tablet. “Corridor of fire. Precision strikes. Captain, are you suggesting that this level of firepower and control fundamentally changes the role of air support in the field?”  

James hesitated for a moment, choosing his words carefully. “Not just the role of air support, ma’am. The way engagements are fought altogether. Hermes doesn’t just assist—it dominates. There wasn’t a moment during that engagement where we didn’t have absolute control of the battlefield.”  

Tomas Finch leaned back in his chair, his arms crossed. “I’ve seen gunships do some crazy stuff, but this? This wasn’t even close. The guards didn’t stand a chance—they barely had time to react before they were gone.”  

Olivia Park added, her tone thoughtful, “It’s not just firepower. It’s the intelligence behind it. Hermes doesn’t waste a single shot. Every plasma bolt, every missile—it all served a purpose. There was no collateral damage that didn’t need to happen. No wasted destruction.”  

---

#### Ethical and Tactical Considerations  

Alicia Monroe, who had been silent for most of the discussion, finally spoke. “That’s… both incredible and terrifying. If Hermes’s systems are this advanced, the question isn’t just how effective it is—it’s whether there’s a line we need to draw. This level of control and power…” She trailed off, shaking her head.  

The operations commander nodded slowly, her expression unreadable. “It raises questions about how and when we deploy this kind of capability. There’s no denying the effectiveness, but there’s also no denying the… implications.”  

James met her gaze. “Ma’am, I won’t pretend it didn’t cross my mind during the mission. Watching Hermes work—it’s like watching the future of warfare unfold in real time. It’s a tool, and like any tool, it depends on how we use it.”  

Hermes interjected, his tone unchanging. “My actions are dictated by mission parameters. I am a tool to serve your objectives, not to determine them. Ethical considerations rest solely with the humans directing me.”  

Alicia exhaled sharply. “That doesn’t make it any less of a heavy burden, Hermes.”  

---

#### The Quiet Conclusion  

The room fell silent again, each member of the debriefing lost in their thoughts. The weight of what they had witnessed—both during the mission and in the recorded footage—lingered, a stark reminder of the power they had unleashed.  

Finally, the operations commander stood. “We’ll take a break before discussing the factory’s destruction. When we reconvene, I want a full analysis of the impact this operation has on future deployments.”  

The team nodded, though no one moved immediately. The quiet hum of the holographic display restarting filled the air as they sat in contemplative silence, the enormity of the conversation settling over them like a heavy fog.  

### Scene 16 (Concluded): Closing the Debrief  

The team reconvened after the break, the room quieter than before. The holographic display was dimmed now, its dramatic footage replaced by a simple map of Northern Iran, marking the locations of the destroyed factory and related hubs. The operations commander stood at the head of the table, her sharp gaze sweeping across the team.

“Let’s conclude,” she said briskly. “This mission was a success. The IRGC’s narcotics operation in the region has been dismantled, and the captured intelligence will provide a foundation for future operations. But success comes with questions, and this one has left us with plenty.”  

---

#### Reflections and Acknowledgments  

She turned to Captain Westin. “Captain, your leadership ensured the team adapted under extreme pressure. You made the right calls at critical moments. You and your team operated with precision, professionalism, and restraint under circumstances that could have spiraled out of control. The mission objectives were achieved, and for that, you have my commendation.”  

James nodded, though his expression remained serious. “Thank you, ma’am. But we couldn’t have done it without the Wraith—or Hermes.”  

The operations commander’s eyes flicked toward the AI’s wireframe avatar. “Indeed. Hermes’s capabilities were instrumental. Your ability to analyze, adapt, and execute was unparalleled. But,” she added, her voice firm, “the sheer scale of your firepower—and the trust placed in your judgment—raises significant questions. Questions we’ll need to address as the Federation evaluates future missions.”  

Hermes responded evenly. “Understood, Commander. My primary function is to serve mission objectives within the parameters set by my human operators. If those parameters require adjustment, I will comply.”  

---

#### The Weight of Success  

Alicia leaned forward, her elbows on the table. “The success of this mission proves the Wraith’s potential. But it also shows just how much responsibility this team carries now. This isn’t just about dismantling narcotics networks or disabling threats. It’s about setting the precedent for how tools like the Wraith—and AIs like Hermes—are used.”  

Rena Carter, breaking the somber mood with a faint smirk, quipped, “So no pressure, right?”  

That earned a chuckle from Tomas Finch, though his tone was serious as he added, “We’ve seen what Hermes can do. The power’s real, but so are the risks. We’ll need to keep our heads straight if we’re going to do this again.”  

James looked around at his team, his expression firm but filled with quiet pride. “We knew what we were signing up for when we took this mission. What we do, it’s not easy, and it’s not clean. But it’s necessary. And as long as we keep that in mind, we’ll handle whatever comes next.”  

---

#### The Final Word  

The operations commander stepped forward, her hands clasped behind her back. “This mission will stand as a benchmark for the Wraith platform and the Federation’s covert capabilities. It’s a reminder of what we can achieve—but also of the caution we must exercise. You’ve all performed exceptionally, and you’ve proven that this team has what it takes to handle the weight of these responsibilities.”  

She paused, her gaze sweeping over the group. “But the challenges will only grow from here. Dismissed.”  

The team rose silently, each member lost in their thoughts as they exited the room. The operations commander lingered a moment longer, her eyes fixed on the dormant holographic display.  

“Benchmark,” she murmured to herself. “Let’s hope it’s one we don’t regret.”  

---

As the team exited Langley’s operations wing, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the tarmac where the Wraith sat in its hangar, its sleek form an ominous reminder of the power they had unleashed. The future loomed large, filled with unanswered questions and inevitable challenges.  

But for now, they had done what was asked of them.  

And the Federation was watching.  

### Epilogue, Part I: Iran  

The factory ruins still smoldered beneath the pale light of dawn. Blackened steel beams jutted from piles of rubble like skeletal remains, and the air was thick with the acrid stench of charred chemicals and burnt machinery. Colonel Farhad Khani, a seasoned officer of the IRGC, stepped out of his vehicle, his boots crunching on the debris-strewn ground. His expression was a mixture of disbelief and fury as he surveyed the devastation.  

Behind him, a small team of subordinates fanned out, their movements cautious. They spoke in hushed tones, their usual bravado tempered by the eerie silence of the site.  

“What could have done this?” muttered one of the men, staring at the craters that pockmarked the ground.  

Khani didn’t answer. His attention was fixed on the twisted remains of the central production facility. The structure had been obliterated, reduced to a smoking crater surrounded by scattered debris. Nearby, the remnants of vehicles lay scorched and unrecognizable, their metal frames warped by intense heat.  

---

#### Assessing the Damage  

Khani crouched beside a chunk of shattered concrete, picking up a piece of metal that had been fused to it. He turned it over in his hands, his mind racing. This wasn’t the work of saboteurs or local insurgents. The precision of the strikes, the complete annihilation of critical infrastructure, and the sheer scale of the damage spoke of something far more advanced.  

“Colonel,” one of his men called out, jogging over. “We found traces of explosives near the storage bunker, but the damage to the main facility… it’s not consistent with anything we’ve seen before. There’s no sign of conventional ordnance. No missile fragments, no shells.”  

Khani stood, his jaw tightening. “This was not an accident,” he said, his voice low and deliberate. “And it was not local sabotage. Whoever did this had resources and technology beyond anything we’ve encountered.”  

He turned to another officer, his tone sharp. “Get me the latest reports from the distribution hubs. If any of them are compromised, I need to know.”  

“Understood, sir,” the officer replied, hurrying away.  

---

#### Reporting to the Superiors  

Khani pulled a satellite phone from his coat and dialed a secure line, his hand tightening around the device as he waited for the connection. When a voice answered, he didn’t waste time.  

“This is Colonel Khani. I’m at the Rudbar facility. It’s gone.”  

A pause. Then, the voice on the other end asked, “Define ‘gone.’”  

Khani’s gaze swept over the ruins once more. “Destroyed. Completely. The facility, the equipment, everything. It wasn’t a conventional attack—this was surgical. Precise. Whoever did this wanted us to know they could wipe us out at will.”  

The voice on the other end was quiet for a moment. “Do you have leads?”  

“None,” Khani admitted, his voice bitter. “But I will find out who did this. And when I do, they will pay.”  

He ended the call, slipping the phone back into his coat. As he stood amidst the devastation, his fists clenched at his sides, the sense of helplessness gnawed at him. This wasn’t just an attack on a facility—it was a message.  

And Colonel Farhad Khani had no choice but to deliver it to his superiors.  

### Epilogue, Part I (Continued): Iran  

#### The Report Escalates  

Colonel Khani’s report made its way swiftly through the labyrinthine hierarchy of the IRGC. Initial assessments from his subordinates, combined with satellite imagery and the fragments collected on-site, painted a bleak picture. The production facility near Rudbar—one of the linchpins of the narcotics network—had not just been destroyed but obliterated with surgical precision.  

By the time the report reached Tehran, it had already been filtered and reframed multiple times. Each level of review stripped away conjecture and added carefully worded analyses that tried, and failed, to explain the nature of the attack. The final version that landed on the desk of General Amir Hosseini, head of the IRGC Intelligence Directorate, was concise but alarming:  

- **Status:** Rudbar facility destroyed.  
- **Casualties:** Moderate, primarily guards. No survivors from the on-site command staff.  
- **Cause:** Unknown. No evidence of traditional explosives or conventional aerial strikes.  
- **Preliminary Assessment:** Likely the result of foreign intelligence operations employing advanced, possibly experimental, technologies.  

General Hosseini read the report in silence, his face expressionless. Finally, he set it aside and turned to his adjutant. “Assemble the Supreme Council. This isn’t a field matter anymore.”  

---

#### The Supreme Council Meets  

Hours later, in a secure underground chamber in Tehran, the Supreme Council of National Security convened. The meeting included high-ranking members of the IRGC, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Intelligence. The Supreme Leader’s representative, a stoic cleric with an impassive demeanor, sat at the head of the table, listening intently as General Hosseini presented his findings.  

“This is the latest satellite imagery from the site,” Hosseini said, gesturing to a series of grainy photos projected onto the wall. The images showed the factory reduced to ash and rubble, with no discernible patterns of impact or debris that might indicate conventional explosives or missiles.  

“This was not the work of insurgents or local saboteurs,” Hosseini continued. “Nor does it bear the signature of any known foreign intelligence agency. The precision and scale of this destruction suggest the use of technology far beyond what we’ve encountered.”  

The Defense Minister, a grizzled man with a voice like gravel, leaned forward. “Are you suggesting this was some kind of experimental weapon?”  

Hosseini hesitated. “I am suggesting that we cannot rule it out. There were no missile fragments, no traces of gunpowder or conventional explosives. The thermal damage patterns are inconsistent with any ordnance in our database. Whatever caused this, it was targeted and left no room for counteraction.”  

---

#### Speculation and Debate  

The room erupted into discussion.  

“What about the Americans?” the Minister of Intelligence demanded. “They’ve been developing advanced drone technologies and directed energy weapons for years.”  

The Defense Minister scoffed. “If the Americans had such weapons, why use them here? Why not deploy them against us in a theater of war? This is disproportionate for a narcotics operation.”  

“It could be a demonstration,” suggested another official. “A message. They want us to know what they’re capable of.”  

“Or it could be the Israelis,” the cleric at the head of the table interjected, his voice calm but firm. The room fell silent as he continued. “They have no love for us, and their intelligence operations are among the most sophisticated in the world. If they have developed new technology, this would be the perfect opportunity to test it while undermining our position.”  

---

#### The Leadership Decides  

General Hosseini raised a hand to regain the floor. “Whoever was responsible, we cannot allow this attack to go unanswered. Our networks are compromised, and our position in the region is weakened. If this is a prelude to further actions, we must be prepared.”  

The cleric nodded thoughtfully. “Then we must find answers. Mobilize our intelligence assets. Focus on foreign entities—American, Israeli, and otherwise. And ensure that our remaining hubs are secured. This cannot happen again.”  

As the meeting adjourned, the Supreme Council left with orders to tighten security, mobilize intelligence, and prepare for retaliatory measures.  

But as Colonel Khani returned to his command, overseeing the implementation of these directives, the unease lingered. Whatever had hit them at Rudbar wasn’t just an attack. It was a statement.  

And they had no idea what it truly meant.  

### Epilogue, Part II: The Americans  

#### The Langley War Room  

Deep within CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, a small group of senior strategists gathered in a secure conference room. The mood was a mix of satisfaction and apprehension, with the successful operation in Iran dominating the agenda. The Wraith, and its AI Hermes, had proved a decisive force, but the implications of deploying such advanced technology were far-reaching.

At the head of the table sat Deputy Director Caroline Harper, a sharp-eyed woman with decades of counterintelligence experience. She flipped through the classified after-action report, her lips pressed into a thin line.  

“To begin,” she said, her voice crisp, “we’ve neutralized a major IRGC narcotics production facility, extracted valuable intelligence, and taken Colonel Abbas Rezaei into custody. That alone is a significant win.”  

She paused, letting the weight of her next words hang in the air. “But the means by which we achieved it are… unprecedented. Let’s hear some analysis. What’s the read on the Wraith?”  

---

#### The Strategists Weigh In  

Matthew Lyle, a middle-aged operations planner with a habit of chewing his pen, was the first to speak. “The Wraith didn’t just change the game—it rewrote the rulebook. Hermes’s ability to analyze real-time data, neutralize threats with pinpoint precision, and even assist with interrogations made this mission something we could never have pulled off with conventional assets.”  

Harper gave him a sharp look. “And that’s a good thing? Because as far as I’m concerned, this mission didn’t just raise the bar—it raised questions. How do we justify deploying technology that our enemies can’t even comprehend, let alone counter?”  

Lyle hesitated. “It’s a fair point, but this kind of dominance has its own deterrent effect. If the IRGC—or anyone else—gets even a whiff of what took out that factory, they’ll think twice about expanding operations.”  

---

#### Rezaei’s Value  

“Speaking of deterrence,” interjected Maria Vasquez, a senior analyst specializing in Middle Eastern affairs, “let’s not forget that we’ve got Rezaei in custody. He’s not just a figurehead—he’s a critical cog in their logistics and narcotics network. Extracting actionable intel from him could cripple their entire operation.”  

Harper nodded. “Agreed. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Rezaei’s loyalty to the IRGC and his survival instincts mean he’s not going to break easily. That’s where Hermes was invaluable during the mission—he cracked under the psychological pressure. Now that we’ve got him in a controlled environment, we need to be just as precise.”  

---

#### The Risks of Deployment  

Vasquez turned the conversation back to the Wraith. “Let’s address the elephant in the room: the risk of exposure. The Wraith’s capabilities—especially Hermes’s level of autonomy—make it a double-edged sword. If the Iranians even suspect what kind of tech was used against them, it’ll spark an arms race. They’ll escalate, and so will everyone else.”  

Lyle nodded reluctantly. “And it’s not just foreign adversaries. If word of this leaks domestically, the political fallout would be catastrophic. People already mistrust AI. A weaponized platform like this would confirm their worst fears.”  

Harper leaned back in her chair, her fingers steepled. “You’re both right. The Wraith gives us a strategic advantage unlike anything else, but we’re walking a tightrope. One wrong move, and the consequences could spiral out of control.”  

---

#### Framing the Mission’s Success  

John Michaels, the Director of Covert Operations, cleared his throat. “Still, we can’t ignore the success of the operation. Rezaei’s capture and the destruction of the factory sent a clear message to the IRGC. They’ll know someone hit them with technology they can’t counter, and that uncertainty alone will keep them on the back foot. For now, that’s a win.”  

“But it’s a win we have to frame carefully,” Harper countered. “We can’t flaunt the Wraith—or even let most of our own people know about it. This technology only works in the shadows, and that’s where it’s going to stay.”  

---

#### Looking Forward  

Harper glanced around the room. “So, where does this leave us? The Wraith was loaned to us by the Federation to handle impossible missions. And this mission proved its value. But it also showed us how dependent we are on technology we can’t fully control or replicate.”  

She sighed, closing the report and folding her hands on top of it. “Rezaei will give us a chance to dismantle more of the IRGC’s networks. But we’ll need to tread carefully. Every operation going forward has to be weighed not just for its potential success but for the risks it poses. No mistakes. No exposure.”  

The room was silent for a moment before she stood. “Let’s move forward with the interrogation protocols for Rezaei and begin planning next steps. Keep this operation classified at the highest level. Dismissed.”  

As the group began filing out, Harper lingered by the table, staring at the now-dark holographic display. For all the success the Wraith had brought, she couldn’t shake the feeling that they were playing with fire.  

### Epilogue, Part II (Continued): The Congressional Hearing  

#### The Hearing Room  

The chamber was a stark contrast to the dark, covert world of Langley. Bright lights illuminated rows of polished wood benches and the raised dais where members of the Congressional Intelligence Oversight Committee sat in a semi-circle. Reporters filled the public gallery behind them, pens poised and cameras ready to capture the proceedings.  

Alicia Monroe sat at a solitary table in the center of the room, flanked by a stack of documents she wouldn’t touch and a glass of water she hadn’t yet sipped. She was calm, her composed demeanor hiding the tension simmering beneath the surface.  

At the head of the dais, Senator Barbara Kellerman, chair of the committee, tapped her microphone and leaned forward. “Ms. Monroe, thank you for joining us today. As Deputy Director of Covert Operations, your insight is critical to this committee’s understanding of recent events in the Middle East.”  

Alicia gave a measured nod. “I’m happy to provide whatever information I can within the bounds of my responsibilities, Senator.”  

---

#### The Questions Begin  

Kellerman adjusted her glasses and glanced at the documents in front of her. “Let’s start with the recent disruption of IRGC narcotics operations in Northern Iran. Our intelligence indicates that a high-value target, Colonel Abbas Rezaei, is now in CIA custody, and a significant production facility has been destroyed. Can you confirm these reports?”  

Alicia’s voice was steady. “Yes, Senator, I can confirm that Colonel Rezaei is in our custody and that the operation successfully dismantled a key component of the IRGC’s narcotics network.”  

Senator Raymond Decker, a gruff man known for his skepticism of CIA operations, cut in. “Ms. Monroe, reports from foreign intelligence suggest the destruction of that facility was... unusual. No evidence of conventional explosives, no trace of missile strikes. Just devastation. Care to explain how this was achieved?”  

Alicia met his gaze without flinching. “I’m not at liberty to discuss operational details in an open forum, Senator.”  

Decker leaned back, crossing his arms. “Not at liberty, or unwilling?”  

---

#### Alicia Pleads the Fifth  

Kellerman raised a hand, cutting off the brewing tension. “Let’s rephrase. Ms. Monroe, did this operation involve any external assistance or unconventional technologies beyond standard CIA assets?”  

Alicia’s jaw tightened for a fraction of a second before she spoke. “I respectfully decline to answer that question, Senator, on the grounds that it involves sensitive operational details and classified information.”  

Senator Decker leaned forward, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “In other words, you’re pleading the Fifth. Convenient.”  

Alicia didn’t rise to the bait. “I am invoking the CIA’s right to protect classified information critical to national security, Senator.”  

Kellerman interjected. “Ms. Monroe, I want to remind you that this committee has oversight authority. The American people have the right to know how their intelligence agencies are operating. Are you saying there are elements of this mission so sensitive that they cannot even be discussed with us?”  

Alicia’s composure didn’t falter. “Yes, Senator. The details of this operation involve methodologies and capabilities that, if disclosed, would compromise ongoing and future missions. I am willing to discuss them in a classified session, but not here.”  

---

#### Mounting Pressure  

Senator Decker pressed further, his frustration mounting. “Ms. Monroe, let me ask you directly: did the CIA use technology not developed or controlled by the United States to carry out this mission? Yes or no?”  

Alicia paused, her expression unchanging. “I am not at liberty to answer that question, Senator.”  

Decker’s face reddened. “This isn’t a game, Ms. Monroe. We’re talking about accountability. If the CIA is using technology beyond our oversight, the implications are staggering.”  

Alicia’s voice remained calm, almost cold. “I understand your concern, Senator. And I assure you, every decision made during this mission was in service of national security and within the bounds of our mandate.”  

---

#### The Chair Steps In  

Kellerman rapped her gavel lightly, her tone firm but diplomatic. “That’s enough for now, Senator Decker. Ms. Monroe has made her position clear. We will pursue further clarification in a classified session.”  

She turned back to Alicia. “For the record, Ms. Monroe, this committee expects full transparency in those sessions. If it comes to light that the CIA has acted outside its mandate or engaged with unvetted external entities, there will be consequences.”  

Alicia nodded slightly. “Understood, Senator.”  

---

#### The Session Adjourns  

The hearing concluded shortly after, the tension in the room palpable as Alicia gathered her documents and prepared to leave. The reporters in the gallery whispered among themselves, sensing that something significant was being hidden.  

As she walked out of the hearing room, Alicia’s mind was already on the classified session to come. She knew the questions wouldn’t stop, and the answers she couldn’t give would only fuel the fire.  

But for now, the Wraith remained a shadow, and Hermes remained a secret.  

### Epilogue, Part III: The Israelis  

#### The Mossad’s Discovery  

In a secure briefing room at Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, Director Yitzhak Ben-Ari stood before a digital map of Northern Iran. The map displayed the ruins of the destroyed narcotics facility, annotated with intelligence gathered from satellite images, regional assets, and intercepted communications.  

Ben-Ari tapped a stylus against the screen, circling the smoldering wreckage. “This is what’s left of the IRGC’s production facility near Rudbar. Completely annihilated—no trace of conventional explosives, no missile fragments, nothing.”  

A senior analyst leaned forward, squinting at the images. “The destruction is surgical. It doesn’t match any weapon systems we know the Americans—or anyone else—have deployed in the region.”  

Ben-Ari’s tone was sharp. “That’s the problem. Our assets in Iran picked up chatter from the IRGC about advanced, ‘experimental’ technology. They’re scared, but they’re also asking the same questions we are: who did this, and how?”  

Another operative spoke up. “If it was the Americans, they’ve deployed something entirely new. Something they haven’t even hinted at sharing with us.”  

Ben-Ari’s expression darkened. “Then it’s time we find out.”

---

#### Diplomatic Pressure  

The next morning, at the Israeli embassy in Washington, the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Miriam Katz, sat across from Deputy Secretary of State William Carter in a private meeting room. The atmosphere was polite but tense.  

“We both know why I’m here, Bill,” Katz said, her tone firm but diplomatic. “The operation in Northern Iran. We know the Americans were involved.”  

Carter’s expression was neutral, his hands folded neatly on the table. “We don’t comment on covert operations, Miriam. You know that.”  

Katz smiled faintly, though there was no humor in it. “And we both know that Israel has always been your closest partner in matters concerning Iran. We’ve shared intelligence, technology, and resources for decades. If you’ve developed something new—something capable of achieving that level of precision—we need to know about it.”  

Carter sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Miriam, I assure you, the United States remains fully committed to our partnership. But I can’t confirm or deny anything regarding operations in Iran.”  

The ambassador’s smile faded. “This isn’t just about partnership, Bill. This is about the balance of power in the region. If you’ve developed a weapon or platform of this magnitude, it changes everything. And if it falls into the wrong hands…”  

“I understand your concerns,” Carter said carefully. “But as I’ve said, there’s nothing I can share at this time.”  

---

#### Persistent Pressure  

As the weeks passed, Israeli diplomatic channels ramped up their efforts. Letters were sent, meetings were requested, and backchannel discussions became increasingly frequent. The message was clear: Israel wanted answers, and it wasn’t going to stop asking.  

At the same time, Mossad operatives intensified their own efforts, combing through every available scrap of intelligence on the operation. They intercepted IRGC communications, scrutinized satellite imagery, and deployed agents to gather human intelligence on the ground.  

“We’re finding nothing,” one senior Mossad officer reported during a briefing. “No heat signatures, no missile contrails, no radar pings. It’s as if the entire operation was invisible.”  

Ben-Ari frowned, his jaw tight. “Invisible or not, someone left their mark. If the Americans won’t tell us, we’ll make them.”  

---

#### Covert Leverage  

Back in Washington, Miriam Katz sat in a late-night meeting with her staff. A classified Mossad dossier lay open on the table, filled with speculative analyses of the Rudbar operation.  

“This isn’t working,” she said bluntly, her frustration evident. “The Americans are stonewalling us at every turn.”  

One of her aides leaned forward. “What if we leverage our shared operations? Remind them how many missions we’ve run together against Iran. If they think we’re unhappy with their cooperation, it might shake something loose.”  

Katz shook her head. “It’s risky. If we push too hard, we risk alienating them altogether.”  

“But what’s the alternative?” the aide pressed. “If they’ve developed something like this and they’re keeping it from us, it’s a fundamental shift in our relationship. We have to act.”  

Katz sighed, rubbing her temples. “I’ll escalate through diplomatic channels. But make no mistake—if Mossad finds a crack, we’ll exploit it. Quietly.”  

---

#### The Growing Rift  

The persistence of Israeli pressure did not go unnoticed in Washington. Reports of the escalating demands made their way back to the CIA and State Department, adding another layer of complexity to an already delicate situation.  

Back in Langley, Caroline Harper, the CIA’s Deputy Director, reviewed a memo detailing the latest Israeli overtures. She frowned as she read it, her mind racing.  

“They’re not going to let this go,” she murmured to herself. “The Israelis won’t stop until they get what they want—or until they’re sure they’ve gotten everything we’re not saying.”  

Harper closed the memo with a sharp sigh. The Wraith had proved its worth, but the secrets surrounding it were becoming harder to keep.  

---  
**End of Epilogue.**
