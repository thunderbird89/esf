## Whisper of Shadows

**Tokyo, Japan - Defense Intelligence Agency Headquarters**

The conference room was silent, the air tense with a mix of concern and frustration. A holographic map of the Sea of Japan shimmered above the round table, dotted with red markers denoting recent incidents. Each was a report of North Korean provocations—commercial shipping harassment, unauthorized maritime patrols, and the occasional ballistic missile launch. The room was populated by high-ranking officers of the Japanese Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), their faces etched with worry.

"Yet another freighter was forced to alter its course under duress," Commander Takashi Mori stated, his voice steady but heavy with urgency. He gestured to one of the glowing markers on the map. "The *Kanzaki Maru*—a vessel carrying critical lithium supplies—was intercepted just outside our territorial waters."

"We've filed protests, sent warnings," General Saito interjected, his tone clipped. "Pyongyang doesn’t seem to care. These provocations are escalating beyond mere political posturing. They’re testing our resolve."

Across the room, the youngest officer present, Lieutenant Ayako Nishi, studied the data scrolling on her tablet. She spoke cautiously, "General, what worries me more are the missile launches. Ballistic trajectories suggest some of these aren't just showpieces for intimidation. There’s refinement in their targeting systems—testing the waters, so to speak."

The murmurs of agreement were punctuated by a distinct cough from a corner of the room. Colonel Hideki Yamada, who had been sitting quietly, leaned forward, his hands clasped in thought. "And yet, despite their improvements, North Korea's capabilities remain... mundane. Crude compared to what we've seen other actors wield."

He paused, letting the weight of his next words settle. "Not unlike the Americans and the Israelis in recent months. Their advances have been... unparalleled. Their precision strikes and defensive systems? They no longer operate within the constraints of conventional technology. Surely, I’m not the only one who suspects assistance from the Federation."

The room fell silent. All eyes turned toward Yamada, whose statement hung in the air like a heavy fog.

General Saito’s brow furrowed deeply. "The Federation," he said slowly, the word carrying a mix of reverence and apprehension. "If what you imply is true, then this is not just a matter of sovereignty or politics. It is a question of control—who dictates the rules in this new game of shadows."

Lieutenant Nishi hesitated before adding, "But the Federation doesn’t get involved lightly, General. If they’ve extended their hand to the Americans and Israelis, it’s for something significant, perhaps to stabilize a growing threat." Her voice dropped. "Maybe something we aren’t yet privy to."

Commander Mori rose, his hands splayed on the table. "Whatever their reasons, it’s clear that the status quo is shifting. And if North Korea has even the faintest inkling of the Federation’s moves, they might see these provocations as a means to bait their response—or worse, escalate to draw attention away from some larger play."

"Then we need intelligence," Saito declared, his voice firm. "We must discern what the Federation is doing and why. If the Americans and Israelis are getting preferential treatment, it could unbalance our entire regional strategy. Lieutenant Nishi, I want a full review of any suspected Federation activities in our region over the last twelve months."

"Aye, sir," Nishi said, her fingers already flying over her tablet.

Colonel Yamada folded his hands again, his gaze distant. "If the Federation is truly watching... then they will know we are, too."

The holographic map flickered as the lights dimmed slightly, the room’s gravity growing heavier. Outside, the Tokyo skyline shimmered with its usual vibrance, unaware of the shifting tides of unseen conflicts. But in this room, where whispers carried the weight of futures, the stakes were unmistakable.

The Federation’s calling card echoed silently in their minds: **"We Are Watching."**

---

The café was a modest but popular corner spot, tucked away in the bustling streets of Shibuya. Lieutenant Ayako Nishi sat in a corner booth, her steaming cup of coffee untouched. Her mind churned with thoughts from the meeting earlier that day, replaying Colonel Yamada’s words. *The Federation. If they’re involved… what could they want from us?*

A soft chime interrupted her reverie as a notification popped up on her phone. It was nothing important—just an advertisement for a streaming service—but her glance caught something else. On the wall opposite her table hung a poster, new and out of place amid the usual advertisements for local music gigs and niche art exhibitions.

The title stood out in bold, stylized letters: **"Federation"**. Below it, an illustration depicted two sleek, futuristic aircraft—one cutting through the clouds, the other emerging from what appeared to be a glowing shield encircling the Earth. The tagline read: *"The Sky Belongs to the Watchers."*

At the bottom, a small, cryptic URL was printed in dark blue:  
**https://www.federation-anime.jp**

Nishi’s brow furrowed as she leaned closer to examine the poster. Her fingers traced her phone absentmindedly. *Anime? This timing… it’s too coincidental.* She snapped a picture of the poster and tucked her phone back into her jacket.

---

That night, Nishi sat cross-legged on her futon, her laptop glowing faintly in the dimly lit room. The URL lingered in her mind as she chewed on her thumbnail. The image of the aircraft was eerily similar to descriptions of advanced Federation technology she’d read in classified files—far beyond what any anime studio should be able to conceive.

Her cursor hovered over the address bar as she typed the URL. A moment of hesitation. Then, with a steadying breath, she hit *Enter*.

The screen flickered to black for a moment before text appeared, white against the void.

> **Welcome, Watcher.**  
> **Initializing secure channel…**  
> **Connected.**  

A chatbox materialized, accompanied by a faint pulsing sound. The username on the other end read: **「生霊少女」**.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard before she typed hesitantly:  
> Nishi: Who is this?

The response came almost instantly.  
> 「生霊少女」: Someone who knows what you saw today. Who knows what’s at stake.

A chill ran up her spine. She glanced around her apartment, the stillness making the quiet seem louder.  
> Nishi: What do you want from me?

There was a pause this time, as if the person—or entity—on the other end was choosing their words carefully.  
> 「生霊少女」: To give you what you need. Tools to protect your country. To ensure that those you care about can sleep soundly.

Her fingers hesitated. The words felt weighty, pressing on her chest.

> Nishi: Why me?

Another pause. When the reply came, the simplicity of it sent a chill down her spine.  
> 「生霊少女」: Because no one expects you.

She swallowed hard, her hands trembling slightly as she pulled them back from the keyboard. The glow of the laptop seemed more menacing now, the words on the screen lingering like a whispered promise.

Her heartbeat quickened as she typed one last question, almost without thinking.  
> Nishi: What happens if I say no?

This time, the response was slower, but no less chilling.  
> 「生霊少女」: You’ll continue as you are. A soldier waiting for orders that may never come. But if you say yes… you’ll be the one giving them.

The screen flickered, and the chat disconnected abruptly, leaving her staring at the blank page. For a long time, she sat frozen, her thoughts a whirl of confusion and fear.

The Federation. The strange poster. This... *生霊少女*. It couldn’t be real. Could it? Yet the words gnawed at her resolve.

*No one expects you.* 

Nishi’s hands clenched into fists as she closed the laptop. The question burned in her mind long into the night: *What do I do now?*

---

Nishi stared at the blank chat screen, her thoughts a jumbled knot of fear and curiosity. Before she could stop herself, her hands returned to the keyboard.

> Nishi: What tools are you offering?

The reply came swiftly, almost as if it had been waiting for her to ask.

> 「生霊少女」: The same ones the Americans are using to stay ahead.  
> The ones that were withheld from the Israelis until they changed their ways.  
> The ones that will let Japan defend itself from the North Korean regime.  
> But only if you ask for it.

Her breath caught as she reread the words. *Withheld until they changed their ways.* Was it referring to the rumors about Federation involvement in Israel’s recent territorial negotiations? And what had the Americans been given? Advanced missile defenses? Covert strike capabilities? She couldn’t ignore the implications.

Her resolve wavered. The weight of her next decision pressed heavily on her chest. Yet, beneath her fear, a flicker of something more primal stirred—hope. If this was real, if these tools could truly protect her country…

Her fingers trembled as she typed.

> Nishi: Give them to me.

For a moment, there was no response, and the silence felt oppressive, as though the room itself held its breath.

Then, the screen flickered, and new text appeared.

> 「生霊少女」: Present this conversation to your superiors.  
> Then, go to the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Hokkaido facility.  
> Everything will become clear there.  

The chat box dissolved into static for a heartbeat before fading to black. One final line appeared in bold white letters, accompanied by a glowing emblem: a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, crossed by two broken swords.

> **Federation**

The laptop powered itself down with a faint hum, leaving Nishi in darkness. She sat motionless, her hands still on the keyboard, as the weight of what had just happened settled over her.

The Federation. The emblem was unmistakable, the same one whispered about in intelligence briefings and classified files. She had just spoken to them—or someone claiming to represent them. And now, they were asking her to take this to her superiors. To walk into the heart of the Defense Intelligence Agency and demand answers.

Her breath hitched as doubt clawed at her. *What if this is a trap? What if it’s some elaborate hoax?*

But deep down, she knew. The Federation didn’t deal in hoaxes. And if they had reached out to her, of all people, it wasn’t by accident.

She glanced at the faintly glowing clock on her nightstand. It was well past midnight. Tomorrow, her life could change forever. But for now, she needed to steady herself.

Sliding the laptop under her bed, Nishi lay back on the futon, staring at the ceiling. The emblem of the Federation burned in her mind, accompanied by their ominous calling card.

*We Are Watching.*

### Into the Shadows

The Defense Intelligence Agency’s Tokyo headquarters was a hive of activity, but the atmosphere in the secure briefing room was distinctly uneasy. Five senior officers, including Colonel Yamada and General Saito, sat around the conference table, their eyes fixed on Lieutenant Nishi. Her normally calm demeanor betrayed a hint of nervous energy.

“This better be good, Nishi,” General Saito said curtly, breaking the silence. “Your request for an emergency meeting disrupted ongoing operations.”

Nishi took a steadying breath and connected her laptop to the room’s secure display system. As the holographic projection blinked to life, she began, her voice steady but tinged with urgency. “What I’m about to show you happened late last night. I believe it warrants immediate attention.”

She played the recording of the chat, starting from her initial interaction with 「生霊少女」 and ending with the ominous instructions to visit the Hokkaido facility. The room was silent, save for the faint hum of the projector.

When the Federation’s emblem flashed on the screen at the conclusion, Nishi turned to face her superiors. “Who—or *what*—ever it was on the other side, they used the handle ‘Wraith Girl.’ I can’t help but notice that in communications with allies, the Americans repeatedly referenced something they called the *Wraith*. It doesn’t align with anything in military registries.”

She paused, her lips quirking into a sheepish smile. “I also couldn’t help but notice the reference to the *Hell Girl* series there… you know, the anime? Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but the phrasing stood out.”

Her attempt at levity fell flat, and the room remained tense. Colonel Yamada finally broke the silence, leaning forward with his hands clasped. “You’re suggesting that the same entity the Americans call the *Wraith* is reaching out to us? And they’ve chosen *you* to make contact?”

“I don’t know why they chose me,” Nishi admitted, her voice firm despite her unease. “But whoever—or whatever—this is, they knew details no outsider should. They spoke of technologies only the Federation could provide. And their timing...” She gestured to the holographic map on the table, which still displayed North Korea’s recent provocations. “It’s too perfect to ignore.”

General Saito’s frown deepened. “And you believe this is authentic? That this isn’t some elaborate psy-op or phishing attempt?”

Nishi nodded. “The emblem at the end of the conversation matched the one from classified files on the Federation. That can’t be forged easily. And the mention of the Hokkaido facility—it’s an internal site, known only to select personnel within the DIA.”

Colonel Yamada tapped his fingers against the table, his expression contemplative. “If this is a Federation contact, the implications are... staggering. But why you? Why not reach out directly to someone higher up?”

“They said it themselves,” Nishi replied, her gaze steady. “‘Because no one expects me.’ Maybe they think I’m less likely to attract attention. Or maybe they’re testing us—seeing if we’ll act on this or dismiss it outright.”

“And if it’s a trap?” General Saito countered.

“I’m willing to take that risk,” Nishi said firmly. “This is too significant to ignore. If the Federation is offering us the same tools the Americans and Israelis are rumored to have received, we can’t afford to hesitate.”

The room lapsed into silence again, the weight of the decision pressing on everyone present. Finally, Colonel Yamada spoke.

“General, I propose we take this seriously. We’ll monitor Lieutenant Nishi as she follows through with the instructions. If this leads to nothing, we lose only time. But if it’s real…” He let the thought hang.

General Saito’s jaw tightened, but he nodded reluctantly. “Agreed. Lieutenant, you are to proceed as directed. However, you will be under constant surveillance. If this is a Federation contact, we need to ensure it’s genuine. And if it’s a trap, we need to neutralize it swiftly.”

“Yes, sir,” Nishi said, bowing slightly. Relief mingled with apprehension as she retrieved her laptop. The meeting concluded quickly, leaving her with a singular task: travel to the Hokkaido facility and uncover the truth behind the enigmatic 「生霊少女」. 

As she left the room, the faint echo of the Federation’s emblem lingered in her mind. For better or worse, her life was about to change.

### Touch of Shadows

The flight to Hokkaido had been uneventful, but Lieutenant Ayako Nishi’s mind buzzed with the weight of her assignment. The Defense Intelligence Agency’s facility nestled in the snowy expanse of northern Japan was a stark contrast to the bustling streets of Tokyo. Its gray, utilitarian buildings stood against a backdrop of towering pines and distant mountains, exuding an air of secrecy and isolation.

Nishi arrived under the guise of routine personnel rotation, and she wasted no time immersing herself in her usual tasks. Her cover was flawless—an analyst reassigned to audit intelligence reports regarding North Korea’s maritime activities. It was work she was intimately familiar with, ensuring she could blend in without suspicion.

But as the hours ticked by, she found it impossible to focus.

The cryptic instructions from 「生霊少女」 loomed over her thoughts, each keystroke on her terminal a reminder that she was waiting for something. *What?* she thought as her eyes darted to the corner of the sterile office, where a faint mechanical hum emanated from the air vents. *An invitation? A sign? A threat?*

The facility bustled with activity, but to Nishi, every sound—whether the distant clatter of boots in the hallway or the buzz of a door scanner—felt ominous. She found herself checking over her shoulder constantly, her eyes scanning for anything unusual.

By midday, her paranoia had reached its peak. As she entered the cafeteria, a loud *clang* from the kitchen made her jump. Her tray slipped from her hands, scattering utensils and rice across the floor.

A few heads turned, but most ignored her, engrossed in their own conversations. Nishi flushed, muttering apologies to the staff as she cleaned up the mess. *Pull yourself together,* she chided herself, her heart still racing.

The rest of the day was no better. She startled at the innocuous hum of the printers in her office and flinched when a colleague accidentally knocked over a stack of files. The tension was suffocating, her every instinct screaming that she was being watched. Yet, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

By the time she returned to her quarters, the only thing more exhausting than her workload was the gnawing doubt in her mind. Sitting at the small metal desk in her room, she opened her laptop and drafted her report to her superiors.

---

**To: General Saito, Colonel Yamada**  
**Subject: Day One, Hokkaido Facility**

Sir,  

I’ve completed my first day at the facility and have maintained cover as instructed. My assigned duties have provided a convenient front, and I’ve ensured my presence remains inconspicuous.  

That said, I must report… nothing unusual has occurred. No contact. No sign of Federation activity. Nothing to indicate the significance of this location.  

While I remain committed to this assignment, I cannot help but question the authenticity of the contact. Was it genuine, or have I been chasing shadows? I will continue to observe and report, but I must admit… my confidence in this mission is beginning to waver.  

Respectfully,  
Lt. Ayako Nishi  

---

She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. Her doubts weighed heavily, and the silence of her quarters amplified her frustration. Was she being played? Or worse, had her superiors sent her here as a test of loyalty, to see how far she would follow through on a phantom lead?

With a sigh, Nishi closed her laptop. The snow outside her window sparkled under the moonlight, a serene contrast to the storm inside her mind. *One day down. Tomorrow might bring something.* She hoped it would. But as she lay down to sleep, the Federation’s emblem haunted her thoughts once more.

*We Are Watching.*

---

The morning air was crisp, biting against Nishi’s cheeks as she walked from the dormitories to the main intelligence building. The snowfall from the previous night crunched softly under her boots, and her breath fogged in the cold as she adjusted the strap of her bag.

The facility was quiet at this hour, the kind of stillness that felt oddly unnatural. She glanced at the rows of vehicles in the staff parking lot, neatly aligned but oddly sparse. The lot felt emptier than usual, an absence that gnawed at the edges of her already-frayed nerves.

As she passed the far end of the lot, a faint shimmer caught her eye—like heat rising from asphalt on a hot day. But this was winter, and the shimmer was unnatural, an almost imperceptible distortion in the air.

She froze mid-step, her pulse quickening. Her hand instinctively went to her phone, her thumb hovering over the emergency call button, when the shimmer deepened, coalescing into the faint outline of a craft. Within seconds, the distortion dissolved, and a sleek, matte-black aircraft materialized before her.

The craft was unlike anything she’d ever seen. It had an angular, predatory design, its surface swallowing the light around it. The air seemed to hum faintly with its presence. On its side, just below the cockpit, was a faintly glowing emblem: a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, crossed by two broken swords.

Her breath hitched. *The Federation.*

Before she could process what was happening, a section of the craft’s underbelly slid open with a smooth, mechanical hiss. A ramp extended to the snowy ground, and a soft, distinctly feminine voice echoed from within.

“Lieutenant Nishi,” the voice called, its tone calm and oddly welcoming. “It’s good to finally meet you. Please, come aboard.”

Nishi’s hand tightened on her phone, her mind racing. “Who... Who are you?”

“You know me already,” the voice replied, an audible smile in its inflection. “生霊少女. You called me ‘Wraith Girl,’ remember? And this…” A faint chuckle followed, accompanied by a subtle shift in tone, as if introducing an old friend. “This is the Wraith platform. The one I promised you.”

Nishi’s grip on her phone slackened as realization struck. The enigmatic 「生霊少女」 from the chat, the mysterious "Wraith" referenced in American reports—it was all connected. And now, standing in front of her, was proof.

“Why me?” she managed to ask, her voice barely above a whisper. The question felt futile now, but she couldn’t help repeating it.

“Because you’re curious,” the voice said gently, almost reassuringly. “And because curiosity drives action.”

The ramp’s soft glow seemed almost inviting, a contrast to the forbidding exterior of the craft. Nishi hesitated, glancing around the lot. Still empty. Still quiet. The world around her felt eerily still, as though holding its breath.

“You’re not going to leave me much of a choice, are you?” she asked, a nervous chuckle escaping her lips.

“You’ve always had a choice, Lieutenant,” the voice replied. “But wouldn’t you like to know what’s waiting for you?”

Nishi swallowed hard, steeling herself. The frost-laden wind bit at her face as she took a step forward, then another. Her boots met the ramp’s surface with a faint metallic echo. She ascended slowly, her heart pounding with every step.

Inside, the Wraith’s interior was dimly lit, a sleek blend of advanced technology and minimalist design. Panels pulsed softly with blue light, and the hum of unseen machinery resonated through the cabin.

As she stepped fully inside, the ramp retracted behind her, and the voice spoke again. This time, it was closer, as if the speaker stood just beside her.

“Welcome aboard, Lieutenant Nishi. Let me show you what the Federation can do.”

The craft’s interior lights dimmed further, and holographic projections flared to life around her, showcasing schematics, tactical maps, and intelligence dossiers. Nishi’s breath caught as she absorbed the overwhelming display. Her doubts from the previous day evaporated in an instant. This was real—undeniably, unshakably real.

And she had just stepped into the heart of it.

---

## The Offer

The Wraith’s cabin was enveloped in a serene, muted glow, its panels humming faintly with a mechanical cadence that was almost soothing. Lieutenant Ayako Nishi stood in the middle of the cabin, her eyes darting from one holographic display to the next as information flowed like a torrent around her. Schematics, tactical maps, and intelligence overlays projected in midair, each more complex than the last.

The voice returned, clear and calm, resonating from the walls themselves. “Lieutenant Nishi, allow me to explain why you are here.”

She turned toward the cockpit, though she knew there was no physical entity speaking to her. The voice belonged to the Wraith’s AI, an intelligence that felt startlingly human despite its synthetic nature. 

“Japan holds a unique position in this region,” the AI continued. “Your nation, alongside its allies, represents a critical counterweight to destabilizing forces—chiefly, North Korea. The Federation’s mandate is clear: to maintain stability on Earth, especially in regions where tension threatens to escalate into open conflict.”

Nishi frowned, folding her arms. “Why intervene at all? The Federation operates in the shadows. Why expose yourself now?”

“Because the situation demands it,” the AI replied without hesitation. “North Korea’s provocations are not isolated events. They are part of a larger pattern—a web of influence involving external powers both terrestrial and extraterrestrial. The Federation has observed these developments for years, but recent escalations have forced us to act.”

The holographic displays shifted, focusing on a map of East Asia. Red and blue markers lit up across the Korean Peninsula, the Sea of Japan, and surrounding territories. The AI highlighted a cluster of incidents involving North Korean missile tests and maritime harassment.

“North Korea’s aggression risks destabilizing not just this region but global power dynamics. Their ambitions, while crude by Federation standards, have the potential to drag major powers into a conflict none of them are prepared to manage. Japan, with its strategic alliances and economic influence, is a cornerstone of stability in this region. Protecting your nation ensures broader equilibrium.”

Nishi’s brow furrowed as she digested the AI’s words. “And the Wraith? Why give us something this… advanced? Surely there are simpler ways to help.”

The AI’s tone softened, almost as if anticipating her question. “The Wraith is more than a weapon. It is a platform for intelligence gathering, rapid response, and covert operations—an asset designed to adapt to crises before they spiral out of control. By entrusting this platform to Japan, the Federation is ensuring that you have the tools necessary to maintain balance without reliance on overt militarization.”

Nishi glanced at the glowing schematics of the Wraith projected beside her. Its sleek form bristled with potential, from its cloaking capabilities to its advanced weaponry and electronic warfare systems. The weight of the responsibility began to settle on her shoulders.

“And me?” she asked, her voice quieter now. “Why make me part of this?”

“You are a bridge,” the AI said simply. “Your role in the Defense Intelligence Agency positions you uniquely as a conduit between the Federation and Japan’s leadership. You are disciplined, yet curious. Loyal, yet willing to question. These qualities are rare.”

Nishi let the words sink in, her mind racing. “You want me to be your… liaison?”

“Yes,” the AI confirmed. “Through you, we can ensure the Wraith is deployed effectively and responsibly. You will convey the Federation’s goals to your superiors while providing us with insight into their strategies and priorities. This is not a task we assign lightly, Lieutenant. The Federation does not act unless the stakes demand it.”

The cabin fell silent for a moment, save for the faint hum of the Wraith’s systems. Nishi took a deep breath, her gaze fixed on the shifting holograms. The enormity of the task before her was daunting, but the clarity of the AI’s logic was undeniable.

“This is… a lot to process,” she admitted. “You’re asking me to represent the Federation’s interests to my own country. That’s not something I can decide lightly.”

“We understand,” the AI said, its tone soothing. “Take the time you need. But remember, Lieutenant Nishi: the tools we offer can protect your nation and preserve the stability of this region. Without them, the risks escalate exponentially.”

The holograms faded, leaving Nishi standing alone in the dim cabin. The silence now felt less oppressive, more reflective. She had a choice to make, one that could reshape the course of her career—and perhaps, the fate of her nation.

The Wraith’s AI spoke once more, its voice gentle but firm. “When you are ready, I will be here. And together, we will ensure your people can sleep soundly at night.”

---

Nishi descended the ramp of the Wraith, her boots crunching softly against the snow-covered asphalt of the parking lot. The morning sun hung low, its light barely warming the icy air. She cast one last glance back as the craft shimmered and faded from view, leaving behind an eerie stillness where moments ago, an advanced Federation platform had stood.

Her mind swirled with conflicting thoughts as she walked briskly toward the main facility. The AI’s words echoed in her head. *A bridge. A conduit. A liaison.* The enormity of the responsibility pressed against her chest, a weight that threatened to crush her resolve.

Reaching her office, she slumped into her chair, barely registering the bustle of her colleagues. The room felt claustrophobic, the stark gray walls closing in as she stared at her screen. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitating. She knew the protocol—any encounter with potential foreign technology or intelligence should be reported immediately. But this wasn’t just foreign intelligence. This was the Federation.

*What would they do if I told them? Would they believe me? Would they even let me continue this mission?*

She tried to focus on her regular tasks, reading through reports on North Korean naval movements and satellite imagery of missile sites. But the words blurred together, her mind consumed by the morning’s events.

By lunchtime, the indecision had become unbearable. She pushed her tray aside in the cafeteria, her appetite nonexistent. Her thoughts churned as she replayed the Wraith’s holographic projections in her mind. Finally, she pushed back her chair and returned to her desk.

Sitting down, she typed a terse email to her superiors.

---

**To: General Saito, Colonel Yamada**  
**Subject: Immediate Request for Meeting**  

Sir,  

I need you both to come to Hokkaido as soon as possible. There is something I must show you—something that cannot be explained in a report. This matter is urgent and of strategic importance to national security.  

Respectfully,  
Lt. Ayako Nishi  

---

She hit *Send* before she could second-guess herself, the whoosh of the email leaving her inbox feeling like a door slamming shut. Her hands trembled slightly as she leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes. *It’s done.* 

But now, there was nothing to do but wait.

---

Unable to focus, Nishi left the building and wandered through the facility grounds. The crisp air was a welcome reprieve from the stifling tension in her office. Her feet carried her almost unconsciously toward the parking lot where it had all started.

The area was just as quiet as it had been that morning. The vehicles were lined up neatly in their rows, a perfect image of normalcy. And yet, she knew better. Somewhere in the lot, hidden behind its cloaking systems, the Wraith was waiting.

Nishi stood still, scanning the empty space. The faint hum she had noticed earlier was gone now, or perhaps she was just imagining it. But she could feel its presence, like a shadow lurking just out of reach.

Taking a deep breath, she spoke softly, almost to herself. “I’ve sent the message. They’re coming.”

There was no reply, no shimmer of light or acknowledgment. Only the wind whispered through the lot, carrying with it the faint scent of pine. Still, Nishi felt a strange comfort in knowing the Wraith was there, even if unseen.

For now, all she could do was wait—for her superiors, for the next step, and for the truth that was slowly unfolding around her. The Federation had chosen her, and the path ahead was no longer hers alone to decide.

---

The morning air was biting, colder than the day before, as Lieutenant Nishi stood waiting at the facility’s main gate. Her hands were stuffed deep into her coat pockets, her breath visible in the frosty air as she watched the black government sedan pull up. General Saito and Colonel Yamada stepped out, their expressions grim but curious.

“You don’t call us out to Hokkaido lightly, Lieutenant,” Saito said as he approached, his voice cutting through the stillness. “This had better be worth it.”

Nishi nodded, swallowing her nerves. “It is, sir. Please, follow me.”

Without further explanation, she led them across the facility grounds, her boots crunching against the snow. The sun had just risen, casting long shadows over the deserted parking lot as they approached. The rows of vehicles gleamed faintly with frost, and once again, the far end of the lot seemed unnaturally empty.

“This is where it happened?” Colonel Yamada asked, his voice skeptical. “An empty parking lot?”

“Not empty,” Nishi replied, her voice wavering slightly. She stopped at the edge of the lot and turned to face the space she knew the Wraith occupied. Her pulse quickened as she drew a deep breath.

“生霊少女!” she called out, her voice firm despite the weight of the moment. “It’s me. I’ve come to take your offer.”

Behind her, General Saito and Colonel Yamada exchanged bewildered glances, clearly struggling to make sense of what they were witnessing. Before they could ask any questions, the air ahead of them shimmered, just as it had the day before.

The Wraith decloaked slowly, its angular, predatory silhouette materializing before their eyes. The frost on the ground melted as the craft’s faint heat signature rippled through the air. The two men stiffened, their skepticism giving way to stunned silence as the ramp beneath the craft lowered with a mechanical hiss.

A familiar, calm voice emanated from the craft, its tone carrying an almost welcoming warmth. “Lieutenant Nishi. General Saito. Colonel Yamada. Welcome.”

General Saito’s mouth tightened as he turned to Nishi. “What… What is this, Lieutenant?”

“This is the Wraith platform,” Nishi said, forcing herself to meet his gaze. “It’s part of what I told you about—the Federation.”

Colonel Yamada’s eyes narrowed, but he said nothing, his gaze fixed on the sleek, matte-black craft before them.

The voice spoke again, addressing them all. “Please, come aboard. There is much to discuss.”

The three exchanged uncertain glances before Nishi took the first step toward the ramp. Her superiors followed hesitantly, their footsteps echoing faintly against the metal as they ascended into the craft. Inside, the dimly lit cabin greeted them with its clean, minimalist design. Holographic projections flickered to life around them, displaying schematics, maps, and intelligence feeds.

“Lieutenant Nishi,” the voice said, its tone shifting slightly, as though addressing an old friend. “Have you made your decision?”

Nishi swallowed hard, her hands clenching at her sides. This was the moment—the choice she had been agonizing over for days. She turned to face one of the glowing panels, as though speaking directly to the AI that now commanded her attention.

“I accept your offer,” she said, her voice steady. “I’ll be your liaison to the Defense Intelligence Agency.”

Her words hung in the air for a moment before the voice responded, its tone carrying a note of satisfaction. “You have chosen wisely, Lieutenant. Together, we will ensure your nation’s safety and preserve the stability of this region.”

General Saito stepped forward, his expression a mixture of shock and skepticism. “What exactly are we agreeing to here? Who—or what—are you?”

The AI responded without hesitation. “I am the Wraith, an autonomous Federation platform. My purpose is to provide intelligence, strategic support, and advanced capabilities to those who align with the Federation’s mandate of stability. Your nation has proven itself a cornerstone in maintaining equilibrium in this volatile region. It is only fitting that you are granted the tools necessary to uphold that balance.”

“And what’s the catch?” Colonel Yamada asked sharply, his tone carrying an edge of suspicion.

“There is no catch,” the AI said simply. “Only trust. Lieutenant Nishi will act as your liaison, ensuring that the Wraith is deployed effectively and responsibly. The Federation’s interest is not in dominance, but in peace.”

The holograms shifted, displaying detailed schematics of the Wraith’s capabilities: cloaking systems, advanced weaponry, electronic warfare modules, and real-time tactical analysis. The two men stared, their skepticism slowly giving way to reluctant awe.

Nishi finally broke the silence. “This isn’t just about Japan. It’s about preventing something worse—something we’re not equipped to handle on our own.”

General Saito’s gaze lingered on the holograms before he turned to Nishi. “You’ve put a lot of faith in this… Federation. Let’s hope it’s justified.”

“It will be,” the AI replied confidently. “Now, if you are ready, we can begin.” 

The cabin filled with a faint hum as the Wraith’s systems powered up, its holographic projections shifting to display real-time intelligence on regional threats. Nishi felt a strange sense of calm wash over her. The path ahead was uncertain, but she was no longer walking it alone.

## Ripples of the Unknown

The Wraith’s sleek, angular form loomed over the Hokkaido facility’s parking lot, its matte-black surface glistening faintly in the morning sun. It was impossible to ignore. Personnel who passed by stopped in their tracks, their eyes widening at the sight of the mysterious craft. 

Rumors spread like wildfire through the base. Soldiers whispered to one another about the strange ship that had appeared out of nowhere, its design unlike anything in their arsenal—or the world’s. Analysts peered out of windows, snapping pictures with their phones, their faces etched with curiosity and disbelief. Within an hour, a small crowd had gathered at a respectful distance, staring in awe at the Wraith.

---

Inside the Wraith, the atmosphere was tense but focused. Holographic projections flickered around General Saito, Colonel Yamada, and Lieutenant Nishi as the AI addressed them. The craft’s interior exuded an otherworldly sophistication, its walls smooth and seamless, pulsing faintly with soft light.

“This platform,” the Wraith began, its calm, feminine voice filling the cabin, “is not a gift. It is a tool, entrusted to your nation under specific conditions.”

General Saito crossed his arms, his brow furrowed. “Conditions? What exactly does the Federation want from us?”

The AI responded without hesitation. “To maintain stability. The Federation’s primary directive is to ensure Earth does not spiral into chaos—whether from internal conflicts or external interference.”

The holograms shifted, displaying a map of East Asia, with glowing red markers denoting recent incidents: missile launches, naval skirmishes, and intelligence reports on North Korean military movements.

“This region,” the AI continued, “is critical to global stability. Japan’s role as a counterbalance to North Korea and its alliances with the United States and other democratic powers make it uniquely positioned to prevent escalation.”

Colonel Yamada leaned forward, his expression skeptical. “And what happens if we don’t meet your conditions? If Japan doesn’t align with your… mandate?”

The Wraith’s voice remained steady. “Then the Federation will withdraw its support. This platform, along with all associated technologies, will be removed. The Federation intervenes only where it is assured of mutual alignment with its goals.”

“And those goals are?” Saito pressed, his tone edged with suspicion.

“To prevent conflict and maintain peace,” the AI said simply. “The Federation operates in the shadows for this reason—providing tools where they are most needed, without becoming a direct participant in geopolitical affairs.”

Lieutenant Nishi, standing to the side, spoke up. “The Federation isn’t asking us to serve them. They’re giving us the means to serve ourselves—to keep the peace in a way we couldn’t before.”

General Saito turned to her, his gaze sharp. “And you trust this machine? This Federation?”

“I do,” Nishi said firmly. “Not blindly. But I’ve seen what this platform is capable of. It’s real, sir. And it’s offering us something we desperately need.”

The room fell silent for a moment, save for the faint hum of the Wraith’s systems. The holograms shifted again, this time displaying a detailed analysis of Japan’s current defense capabilities against North Korean provocations. Beside it was a simulation of how the Wraith’s intervention could neutralize threats with precision and efficiency.

“This platform will operate under your command,” the AI said, addressing Saito and Yamada. “Lieutenant Nishi will act as your liaison, ensuring the Federation’s conditions are met. In return, the Wraith will provide intelligence, tactical support, and advanced operational capabilities.”

Colonel Yamada exchanged a glance with Saito, his skepticism softening into cautious acceptance. “If this is real—and I’m still not sure I believe it—then this changes everything.”

“It is real,” the AI said, its tone carrying a subtle note of finality. “And it is now your responsibility.”

Saito sighed, his shoulders tense but resolute. “If we’re to accept this… gift, then we’ll need assurances. Transparency. This isn’t something we can take lightly.”

“Transparency will be provided where possible,” the AI replied. “But there are limits to what the Federation can reveal. You must decide if the results are worth the uncertainty.”

Outside, the crowd in the parking lot continued to grow, their murmurs audible even from inside the Wraith. The weight of the moment pressed heavily on everyone in the cabin. Finally, Saito turned to Nishi.

“This is your mission now, Lieutenant,” he said. “You’ve brought this to us. You’ll be our connection to the Federation.”

Nishi nodded, her resolve firm. “I won’t let you down, sir.”

The Wraith’s voice interjected, calm and unwavering. “Together, we will ensure stability. The Federation will watch over this region—but only if you are willing to lead.”

General Saito exhaled sharply, then gave a single nod. “Very well. Let’s see what this platform can do.”

### Stepping Into the Spotlight

The ramp of the Wraith lowered with a hiss, and Lieutenant Nishi followed General Saito and Colonel Yamada into the biting morning air. The small crowd that had gathered outside the craft had grown significantly, their hushed conversations swelling into murmurs of excitement and disbelief.

General Saito raised a hand to quiet them. His commanding presence immediately brought the scene under control. “This is a classified asset under the jurisdiction of the Defense Intelligence Agency,” he barked, his voice carrying over the parking lot. “I want everyone not cleared for this project to return to their duties immediately. There will be no photos, no discussions, and no unauthorized access to this area. Do I make myself clear?”

The murmurs quieted, and people began to disperse, though not without glances back at the Wraith’s intimidating silhouette. Colonel Yamada remained by Saito’s side, his sharp gaze ensuring the General’s orders were followed to the letter.

Nishi, meanwhile, seized the opportunity to slip away, her unassuming presence allowing her to melt into the background. She moved quickly but calmly, her destination clear in her mind: the commander of the facility’s field agents.

---

The commander’s office was a modest, utilitarian space on the second floor of the main intelligence building. Inside, Commander Hiroshi Takeda, a middle-aged man with a gruff demeanor and a reputation for no-nonsense leadership, was seated behind a metal desk cluttered with reports and tactical maps.

He barely glanced up when Nishi entered. “Lieutenant Nishi,” he said, his tone curt. “I assume you have a reason for interrupting me?”

“I do, sir,” she replied, steadying her voice. “General Saito has tasked me with assembling the first team to be trained on the Federation platform.”

Takeda’s pen froze mid-signature, and he looked up sharply. “The Federation platform? You’re talking about that… thing sitting in the parking lot?”

“Yes, sir,” Nishi confirmed, her voice calm but firm. “The Wraith. It’s a game-changer, and we need agents ready to operate with it.”

Takeda leaned back in his chair, studying her with narrowed eyes. “And the General personally assigned you to this?”

“Yes, sir,” Nishi said without missing a beat. “He’s overseeing the situation outside right now, but he made it clear this needs to move quickly. I’m acting under his authority.”

It wasn’t entirely a lie—the General *had* told her this was her mission. But she wasn’t about to let Takeda’s skepticism slow things down.

Takeda frowned, his gaze scrutinizing her for a moment longer before he gave a resigned nod. “Fine. I’ll authorize it. But if this goes sideways, it’s your head on the line, not mine.”

“Understood, sir,” Nishi replied, relief washing over her.

Takeda grabbed a clipboard from his desk and scanned its contents. “I’ll assign Agent Ishikawa as team lead. He’s sharp and adaptable. You’ll also need specialists for electronic warfare and close-quarters combat. I’ll have profiles sent to you by the end of the hour. Anything else?”

“No, sir,” Nishi said. “Thank you.”

She turned to leave, her heart pounding in her chest. As the door closed behind her, she allowed herself a small, triumphant smile. The pieces were falling into place, and for the first time, she felt a sense of control over the chaos unfolding around her.

The Wraith had chosen her, and now she was beginning to choose her path.

---

### The Wraith’s Introduction

The interior of the Wraith hummed with energy as the newly assembled team of field agents stepped cautiously into the craft. Nishi stood near the entrance, her posture straight and confident despite the nervous flutter in her stomach. This was her mission now, and she had to own it.

The team consisted of four agents: Ishikawa, the team lead, a tall man with sharp eyes and a no-nonsense demeanor; Okabe, a wiry electronic warfare specialist with an almost hyperactive energy; Tanaka, a solidly built close-quarters combat expert with a steady, quiet presence; and Kuroda, a young reconnaissance expert with a knack for blending into crowds.

As the agents took in the sleek interior of the Wraith, the holographic projections around them flared to life. Schematics of the craft appeared, rotating slowly in midair, accompanied by streams of data. The AI’s calm, feminine voice filled the cabin.

“Welcome aboard the Wraith. I am the platform’s integrated AI, tasked with supporting your operations, providing tactical analysis, and ensuring mission success. Together, we will achieve the Federation’s objectives.”

Okabe tilted his head, his eyes narrowing at the projection of the Wraith’s schematics. “So… you’re the Wraith Girl? That’s what Nishi told us.”

“That is one of the designations I have been given,” the AI replied smoothly. “It is derived from my operational alias, 生霊少女, or ‘Wraith Girl.’”

Tanaka frowned, his eyes darting to the glowing orb in the center of the projection that pulsed faintly as the AI spoke. “No offense, but your voice is a little… intimidating. It’s like you’re about to announce the end of the world.”

The AI paused, as if considering his comment. “My current auditory profile is designed to convey authority and clarity. Would you prefer an alternative tone or visual representation?”

Ishikawa crossed his arms, smirking slightly. “You’re saying you can change how you look and sound?”

“Correct,” the AI responded. “I can adapt my visual and auditory interface to better suit your preferences. Shall we experiment?”

Okabe grinned, leaning forward eagerly. “Oh, this I have to see.”

The holograms shifted, and the first new avatar materialized in front of them: a tall, imposing figure with a military cap and a ship’s wheel motif, clearly inspired by *Kantai Collection*. The AI spoke, her voice taking on a confident but slightly softer tone. “How does this suit you?”

Kuroda chuckled nervously. “It’s… um… still pretty intimidating.”

“Understood,” the AI replied. The avatar dissolved, and a new one took its place—a petite girl with animal ears and a short uniform, reminiscent of *Strike Witches*. Her voice became lighter and almost cheerful. “Perhaps this is more approachable?”

Tanaka raised an eyebrow. “I… don’t know if that’s better.”

The AI continued seamlessly, shifting to another form—a traditional shrine maiden with long flowing hair, clearly drawn from *Touhou Project*. Her voice took on a calm, melodic quality. “I am always willing to adjust to your needs. Does this inspire confidence?”

Okabe was practically in stitches, while Ishikawa rubbed his temples. “Alright, alright. I think we get the point.”

Nishi, who had been watching the display with a mixture of amusement and exasperation, finally stepped in. “Let’s keep things professional, Wraith. Maybe something a bit more neutral?”

The holograms shifted again, and the avatar settled into a sleek, futuristic figure with minimalistic features—still feminine but without the exaggerated traits of the previous forms. Her voice returned to its original tone, though softened slightly. “Acknowledged. I will maintain this profile for now. If further adjustments are necessary, do not hesitate to inform me.”

The agents exchanged glances, their expressions ranging from bemused to intrigued. Ishikawa finally spoke up. “Alright, Wraith. Let’s get serious. What exactly can you do?”

The holograms around them expanded, displaying real-time tactical overlays, schematics of the craft’s cloaking systems, and detailed intelligence maps of the region. The AI’s voice resumed its calm professionalism. “This platform is equipped with advanced electronic warfare capabilities, real-time reconnaissance tools, and precision strike systems. My purpose is to augment your team’s effectiveness while maintaining operational security. Allow me to demonstrate…”

As the Wraith began showcasing its capabilities, Nishi felt a flicker of pride. The agents were impressed—intimidated, perhaps, but willing to learn. The Federation’s tools were in their hands now, and it was up to her to ensure they were used wisely. 

This was only the beginning.

The holographic projections around the cabin flickered as the Wraith’s AI began explaining the platform’s myriad features. The agents stood in a loose semicircle, their focus shifting between the glowing displays and the AI’s sleek new avatar.

“Let us begin with the Wraith’s primary capability: stealth,” the AI said. A schematic of the craft expanded, highlighting its cloaking systems and emitting faint pulses to emphasize specific components. “The Wraith employs active radar cancellation, optical cloaking, and thermal masking to render itself invisible to conventional and advanced detection systems. These systems can remain operational near-indefinitely, allowing for prolonged covert operations.”

Kuroda leaned forward, squinting at one of the overlays. “So… this thing could park right in the middle of an enemy base and no one would know?”

“Precisely,” the AI confirmed, her tone carrying a faint note of satisfaction. “After all, did I not do just that?”

The team exchanged glances, and Okabe let out a low whistle. “You’re saying you’ve been sitting here this whole time, and no one noticed? That’s… unsettling.”

“It is also a demonstration of my capabilities,” the AI replied. “The Federation designed this platform to operate undetected in even the most hostile environments. Its stealth systems are complemented by an advanced electronic warfare suite.”

The schematics shifted, replaced by a projection of the Wraith’s electronic warfare systems. A glowing grid represented the range of its capabilities, with icons symbolizing drones, communications arrays, and enemy vehicles.

“These systems allow me to disrupt or control enemy communications, disable surveillance networks, and neutralize electronic threats,” the AI continued. “For example, I can intercept encrypted transmissions, jam radar and sonar systems, and deploy targeted EMP bursts to disable hostile electronics.”

Ishikawa nodded, his arms crossed as he studied the display. “And this electronic warfare… it’s remote? Or do we need to get close?”

“I can operate at a range of several kilometers, depending on the environment and the strength of the opposing systems,” the AI explained. “In optimal conditions, I can neutralize an enemy network without ever entering their detection range. However, proximity increases effectiveness.”

Tanaka, who had been quiet until now, gestured toward another display showing interior schematics. “And this? Is the Wraith meant to act as a mobile HQ?”

“Correct,” the AI said, shifting the display to highlight the craft’s interior features. “The Wraith is equipped with secure communications and real-time tactical analysis tools, making it an ideal field headquarters. Its onboard systems can coordinate operations, process intelligence, and provide mission-critical support to deployed teams.”

She paused, allowing the agents to absorb the information before continuing. “It is also equipped with an interrogation and containment module, crew quarters for extended deployments, and a modular bay capable of housing two Q-cars or equivalent field assets.”

Okabe’s eyes lit up. “Wait, two Q-cars? So this thing’s not just brains, it’s muscle too?”

“Indeed,” the AI confirmed. “While the Wraith’s primary role is support and coordination, it is also capable of direct engagement. Its offensive systems include a turreted plasma cannon, dorsal missile banks, and modular hardpoints for additional weaponry as needed.”

The schematics shifted again, displaying a simulation of the plasma cannon firing, its energy bolts slicing through a simulated armored target. The team watched in awe as the simulation zoomed out to show a missile salvo obliterating a cluster of drones.

“For defense,” the AI continued, “the Wraith relies primarily on its stealth systems to avoid detection. However, should engagement become unavoidable, its mid-grade energy shields can withstand sustained anti-aircraft fire. Additionally, its agility and electronic countermeasures allow it to evade or neutralize most airborne threats.”

Kuroda let out a low hum of appreciation. “So it’s basically a fortress that no one can see.”

“A fortress,” the AI replied, “that you now command. This platform is not just a tool—it is an extension of your team’s capabilities. With proper training, you will be able to leverage its features to outmaneuver, outwit, and outlast any adversary.”

The room fell into a contemplative silence as the agents took in the enormity of what they were being handed. Nishi, standing slightly apart from the group, felt a quiet surge of pride. This was her team, her mission—and the Wraith was the key to everything they would accomplish.

The AI’s voice broke the silence, calm but resolute. “There is much more to learn, and our time is limited. Shall we proceed?” 

The agents exchanged nods, their initial hesitation fading into focused determination. They were ready. Or, at least, they were willing to try.

The Wraith’s holograms flared brighter, the displays shifting to the next topic. The briefing was far from over, and the team was just beginning to understand the true potential of the Federation’s prized platform.

### A Glimpse of Destruction

The Wraith’s holographic displays flickered and shifted, the schematics and tactical overlays replaced by a glowing playback bar. The AI’s calm voice addressed the team as they stared at the suspended image of a desert landscape, partially obscured by heat distortion.

“To understand the Wraith’s full capabilities, I will show you an operational engagement. This footage was recorded during an extraction mission in Iranian territory, involving an infiltration team codenamed *Hermes*. Their objective was to sabotage a high-value weapons manufacturing facility while evading local military forces.”

The playback began, and the team leaned in, their curiosity palpable. The footage appeared to be from the Wraith’s perspective, its systems highlighting targets and terrain in sharp relief.

The camera panned over a convoy of armored vehicles speeding toward the factory complex. A targeting overlay illuminated each vehicle in red as the AI narrated. “Reinforcements were en route to intercept the Hermes team, requiring immediate action.”

A split second later, the Wraith’s missile banks came to life. The footage showed the craft firing precise salvos, each missile streaking through the air and striking a target with pinpoint accuracy. The explosions were almost surgical, engulfing the vehicles in flames while sparing the surrounding terrain.

“Missiles neutralized the convoy,” the AI explained. “Engagement time: six seconds.”

“Six seconds?” Okabe whispered, his voice tinged with disbelief. “It’s like they never even had a chance.”

The footage shifted as the Wraith approached the factory complex, its plasma cannon swiveling into position. The overlay identified various obstacles: barricades, guard towers, and reinforced gates.

“The Hermes team required a direct route to the extraction point,” the AI said. “Obstructions were dismantled to facilitate their retreat.”

The plasma cannon fired with terrifying efficiency, bolts of searing energy obliterating each obstacle in its path. Guard towers crumbled, barricades vaporized, and the reinforced gates melted away as if they were paper. The footage was eerily silent, save for the hum of the Wraith’s systems and the occasional flash of destruction.

Tanaka crossed his arms, his jaw tightening. “That’s… brutal. Precise, but brutal.”

“It had to be,” Nishi interjected, her voice steady despite the awe on her face. “The team’s survival depended on it.”

The camera zoomed in as the Hermes team emerged from the factory, their forms highlighted in green by the Wraith’s targeting systems. Gunfire erupted around them, but the plasma cannon swept the area, neutralizing hostiles with mechanical precision. The Wraith descended toward the extraction point, its ramp extending to receive the team.

Once the Hermes operatives were safely aboard, the footage took on a new intensity. The Wraith pulled back, the factory sprawling beneath it. The overlay highlighted key structures in red, marking them for destruction.

“With the team secured, the Wraith completed the mission objective,” the AI said. “The facility was destroyed to prevent further production of advanced weapons.”

The Wraith’s missiles launched again, striking storage tanks and power stations. The plasma cannon followed, carving through walls and silos with frightening ease. Secondary explosions rippled through the complex as the factory collapsed in on itself, reduced to smoldering rubble in under a minute.

When the footage ended, the team sat in stunned silence, their faces a mix of awe and unease. Kuroda broke the silence first, his voice almost a whisper. “It’s not just a fortress… it’s a weapon of annihilation.”

“Controlled annihilation,” the AI corrected. “Every action is calculated to minimize collateral damage and maximize mission success. The Wraith does not act indiscriminately.”

Okabe leaned back, exhaling sharply. “I knew this thing was advanced, but seeing it in action… It’s like having a storm in your back pocket.”

Ishikawa remained silent, his gaze fixed on the now-blank hologram. His mind was clearly racing, weighing the implications of commanding such a platform.

“It’s overwhelming,” Tanaka said finally. “The precision, the power… It’s hard to even wrap your head around.”

Nishi stepped forward, her voice calm but resolute. “And now it’s in our hands. This is what the Federation is entrusting to us—not just to use, but to use wisely. It’s a responsibility, not a free pass.”

The AI’s voice followed seamlessly, addressing the group. “You are correct, Lieutenant. The Wraith is a tool, one that requires discipline and foresight to wield effectively. With proper training, you will become the vanguard of stability in this region.”

The room fell into another silence, the weight of the demonstration still hanging heavily over the team. They weren’t just being shown a piece of advanced technology—they were being entrusted with something that could reshape the balance of power.

Nishi’s gaze swept over the team, their expressions ranging from awe to determination. This was just the beginning, but the stakes were already clear. The Wraith wasn’t just a platform—it was a promise, and they were the ones who had to keep it.

### Whispers in the Cafeteria

The cafeteria buzzed with low conversation, the hum of speculation filling the air. Officers, analysts, and field agents sat in small groups, their trays forgotten as they exchanged whispered stories about the enigmatic craft parked in the far lot. The Wraith had become the talk of the base, and the tales surrounding it grew with each retelling.

A junior analyst leaned over his tray, his voice hushed but excited. “I heard it just *appeared* one morning. No warning, no landing—just decloaked right there in front of Lieutenant Nishi.”

His companion, a field engineer, snorted into his coffee. “Yeah, right. Like a ghost ship. Next, you’ll tell me she *summoned* it.”

“That’s exactly what I heard,” a logistics officer chimed in, her eyes wide with excitement. “She called out to it—what was the name again? Something about a spirit girl?”

“生霊少女,” the analyst supplied, stumbling over the pronunciation. “It means ‘Wraith Girl,’ I think. Supposedly, she said it, and bam, there it was.”

Another officer, older and more skeptical, crossed his arms as he listened. “That’s ridiculous. You’re telling me the most advanced craft in existence is voice-activated by a single officer? What if someone sneezes the wrong way?”

The group chuckled nervously, but the logistics officer shook her head. “No, it’s more than that. They say the Wraith chose her.”

“Chose her?” the field engineer repeated, incredulous.

The logistics officer leaned in conspiratorially. “Yeah, like it singled her out. She’s the only one who can call it. I heard the General himself had to defer to her because of whatever connection she has to the thing.”

“That’s absurd,” the older officer scoffed. “Machines don’t choose people.”

“But this isn’t just a machine,” the analyst countered, his voice lowering further. “It’s Federation tech. You’ve read the briefings—if anyone could build something that chooses, it’s them.”

The field engineer scratched his chin, a flicker of doubt crossing his face. “And she’s the only one who’s actually spoken to it, right?”

The logistics officer nodded vigorously. “Exactly! No one else even gets close to it without her around. The General’s probably afraid it’ll vanish if she’s not there.”

The older officer sighed heavily, clearly unconvinced. “These rumors are getting out of hand. Next, you’ll tell me she controls it with her mind.”

“Well…” the analyst began hesitantly, but the older officer cut him off with a dismissive wave. “Don’t even start.”

---

Across the cafeteria, another group was huddled around their table, equally engrossed in the latest stories. A young communications specialist recounted the tale with dramatic flair. “I heard it doesn’t even land—it just hovers there, waiting for her. Like it’s alive or something.”

“That’s nothing,” a logistics handler said, shaking his head. “I heard she walked into the parking lot and *dared* it to show itself. And it did!”

“Dared it?” another specialist laughed. “What, like a kid challenging a monster in a ghost story?”

The logistics handler shrugged. “Hey, that’s what I heard. She said something like, ‘Come out if you’re real,’ and boom—it decloaked right there.”

“I heard it’s the other way around,” a transport officer added, his voice barely above a whisper. “The Wraith called *her*. Like, in her head. That’s why she knew where to go.”

The group fell silent for a moment, the idea settling uncomfortably in their minds. Finally, the communications specialist spoke, his tone half-joking but tinged with unease. “If that’s true, maybe we should start being nicer to her. You know, just in case.”

The table erupted in nervous laughter, but beneath it was a current of genuine awe. The Wraith—and by extension, Lieutenant Nishi—had captured their imaginations, transforming the mundane rhythms of base life into something extraordinary.

---

Stories continued to ripple through the cafeteria, growing and shifting with each retelling. The Wraith was no longer just a craft—it was a legend in the making, and Nishi was at its center.

The rumors would evolve further, weaving a tapestry of awe, fear, and curiosity that bound the base together in shared wonder. But for now, the tales of summoning and choosing were enough to keep the whispers alive.

---

As the initial wave of stories about Lieutenant Nishi and her supposed connection to the Wraith began to settle, the talk naturally shifted to the craft’s capabilities. Its mere presence had already sent ripples of fascination through the base, but the snippets of information leaking from the team assigned to it were fueling an entirely new round of speculation.

A young radar technician leaned forward at his table, his voice barely above a whisper. “You know how we never picked it up on our systems? That’s because it’s *invisible*, even to the best gear we have.”

“I heard the same thing,” a supply officer chimed in, nodding. “One of the agents said the Wraith can hover right over an active radar array and not even ping. It’s like… it doesn’t exist.”

The technician nodded eagerly. “Exactly. They said it cancels out its own radar signature. Some kind of… counter-wave thing. Makes it look like empty air. And it masks its heat too—totally invisible to IR scans.”

A senior analyst sitting nearby frowned thoughtfully. “That sounds like more than just cloaking. That’s electronic warfare at its peak.”

“Oh, you haven’t even heard the half of it,” a junior field agent interjected, leaning his chair back on two legs. “Okabe—the guy from the Wraith team? He said the thing can intercept any signal in range, even encrypted ones. Like, it doesn’t just jam them—it listens in and *deciphers* them.”

“That’s insane,” the supply officer said, his tone awestruck. “How is that even possible?”

The field agent shrugged. “It’s Federation tech. That’s all they ever say when you ask how it works.”

“Yeah, but it’s not just signals,” another communications specialist added, joining the conversation. “I heard it can scramble entire networks. Like, wipe out every drone or camera linked to a system. One minute they’re working fine, and the next… nothing.”

A skeptical logistics handler raised an eyebrow. “Sounds like someone’s been exaggerating.”

“I don’t think so,” the specialist replied. “Okabe wouldn’t shut up about how it knocked out an entire grid during their simulation runs. All their systems just… went dark.”

The radar technician leaned in again, his expression serious. “I heard it’s even worse for vehicles. They said the Wraith can disable a convoy without firing a single shot—just flips a switch, and every engine stalls.”

“That can’t be real,” the handler scoffed, shaking his head. “No way one platform can do all that.”

“Why not?” the specialist countered. “It’s not like anything else we’ve seen. If it can cloak itself and hack networks, why wouldn’t it be able to take out vehicles too?”

The handler didn’t reply, but his skepticism seemed to waver.

---

Across the room, another group was deep in their own discussion. A naval officer with a weathered face gestured animatedly as he spoke. “You all remember that drill we ran last week? The one where we simulated a communications blackout? Well, I found out afterward it wasn’t a glitch.”

The others at his table leaned in, their curiosity piqued.

“It was the Wraith,” the officer continued. “They were testing its EWAR capabilities. Knocked out every comms line we had without tripping a single alarm.”

“Wait,” a young marine interjected, his brow furrowed. “You’re saying it spoofed the entire network? Like, made it look like everything was normal?”

The officer nodded grimly. “Exactly. It wasn’t until after the drill ended that we realized the systems weren’t just down—they’d been *tricked*. Half the data we thought we were transmitting was fake.”

The marine sat back, shaking his head. “That’s terrifying. If it can do that to us, imagine what it could do to an enemy.”

“That’s the point,” the officer said simply. “With the Wraith in the field, the enemy won’t know what hit them—because they won’t even know it’s there.”

---

The conversations swirled throughout the cafeteria, growing more intense with every new detail shared. The Wraith’s abilities were becoming the stuff of legend, its capacity for stealth and electronic warfare painting a picture of an unstoppable force operating from the shadows.

For now, the talk stayed focused on its subtlety—its ability to disappear, disrupt, and deceive. But the stories of what it could do when it chose to act decisively, when subtlety was no longer an option, were waiting in the wings, ready to ripple through the base like the echoes of an oncoming storm.

---

As the discussions about the Wraith’s stealth and electronic warfare capabilities began to wind down, the tone in the cafeteria shifted. A hushed intensity took hold as the conversation turned to the one thing that had everyone on edge: its raw destructive power.

“Did you hear what Tanaka told the motor pool guys?” a logistics officer whispered to her table, leaning in conspiratorially. “He said the Wraith isn’t just a ghost—when it decides to strike, it’s like… like a storm unleashed.”

The others at the table exchanged uneasy glances. “What kind of storm?” someone asked cautiously.

“A very precise one,” the logistics officer replied. “Apparently, they watched footage of it taking out an entire convoy without breaking a sweat. Missiles, plasma cannon, the works. Everything was obliterated in seconds.”

A junior analyst at the next table overheard and turned to join in. “That’s nothing. Ishikawa told someone in recon that it wasn’t just the convoy. After the team it was extracting got on board, the Wraith turned its weapons on the whole factory they were targeting.”

A young marine blinked in disbelief. “The whole factory? As in, leveled?”

“Completely,” the analyst confirmed. “Plasma cannon melted through reinforced walls like butter. Missiles hit every critical structure with pinpoint accuracy. They said it took less than a minute to turn the place into rubble.”

“Less than a minute?” a supply officer repeated, his voice tinged with awe. “You’re telling me it leveled an entire facility faster than we could even call in an airstrike?”

The analyst nodded solemnly. “And it wasn’t just brute force. It was surgical. Every shot was calculated to cause maximum destruction while minimizing waste. The team said it was… surreal. Like watching a scalpel with the power of a wrecking ball.”

---

At another table, the conversation was even more charged. A communications officer leaned forward, her voice low and urgent. “Okabe said it didn’t just destroy the place. It *erased* it. Like, there’s nothing left to salvage.”

“Nothing?” a field engineer asked, frowning. “That doesn’t sound right. Even an airstrike leaves debris.”

“Well, that’s the thing,” the communications officer continued. “The plasma cannon didn’t just punch holes—it atomized parts of the structure. And the missiles? They triggered chain reactions that took out the rest.”

“Chain reactions?” the engineer asked skeptically.

“Yes!” she insisted. “Okabe said the Wraith targeted key points to make the whole facility collapse in on itself. No debris worth scavenging, no intel left behind. Just smoke and ashes.”

Another officer nearby shook his head, his face pale. “That’s terrifying. It’s not just the power—it’s how it uses it. Like it knows exactly what to do to leave nothing standing.”

The communications officer nodded. “Exactly. It’s not like it’s just firing at random. Every shot, every strike… it’s all part of some bigger plan.”

The cafeteria grew quieter as more groups joined the discussion, their voices hushed as the weight of the stories settled over them. A seasoned naval officer, who had been silently listening, finally spoke up, his voice grim.

“This isn’t just a weapon,” he said, his tone carrying the authority of experience. “It’s a deterrent. Something the Federation made to show they mean business.”

“But why give it to us?” a younger officer asked nervously. “Why let us have something that powerful?”

The older officer’s gaze swept over the room, his eyes dark with thought. “Because they expect us to use it. Or at least, to make everyone else *think* we’ll use it. That’s how deterrents work.”

The younger officer fell silent, the gravity of the statement sinking in.

---

The conversation continued, but now it was laced with a sense of unease. The Wraith wasn’t just an asset—it was a responsibility, one that could shape the balance of power in ways no one fully understood. The cafeteria buzzed with the tension of unanswered questions, and everyone present knew that the stories would only grow from here, their implications rippling far beyond the walls of the base.

### The Legend of Mistress Nishi

Lieutenant Nishi stepped into the cafeteria, the familiar hum of conversations and clatter of trays greeting her. She exhaled softly, relieved to take a break from the intensity of the past few days. But as she made her way toward the food line, heads began to turn. Conversations paused mid-sentence, and she could feel eyes following her.

*Not again,* she thought, her stomach sinking.

She collected her tray and scanned the room for an empty table, only to find herself intercepted by a grinning field agent she vaguely recognized. His name tag read *Kobayashi*, and he was flanked by two equally amused-looking colleagues.

“Lieutenant Nishi,” Kobayashi said with mock reverence, bowing slightly. “It’s an honor to meet the one who summoned the Wraith from the ether.”

She blinked, nonplussed. “What?”

“You know,” one of his companions chimed in, smirking. “The way you called out its name and it appeared out of nowhere. I heard the General was so shocked he couldn’t speak.”

“That’s not what happened,” Nishi said quickly, her cheeks flushing. “It wasn’t— I mean, it wasn’t like that.”

“Oh, come on,” Kobayashi said, grinning wider. “Half the base knows the story by now. You walked into the parking lot, called out to it like some kind of sorceress, and poof—there it was!”

Nishi groaned inwardly. “That’s an exaggeration. I just… It was already there, cloaked. I knew it was there because—” She stopped herself, realizing anything she said would only fuel the fire.

“Because you *command it*,” Kobayashi finished for her, his tone dripping with faux admiration. “It’s okay, you don’t have to downplay it. The Wraith chose you, after all.”

“It didn’t *choose* me!” Nishi said, her voice rising slightly. She glanced around, hoping the conversation wasn’t drawing too much attention, but more people were starting to look their way. “It’s a machine. An advanced, Federation-built machine. That’s all!”

Kobayashi’s companion leaned in, a mischievous glint in her eye. “But you did say its name, didn’t you? ‘Wraith Girl’? The whole 生霊少女 thing?”

Nishi sighed, setting her tray down on the nearest table. “Yes, I said its name, but that’s just… That’s how it communicates. It’s not some magical entity that answers to my beck and call!”

As if on cue, the cafeteria loudspeakers crackled to life. The room fell silent as a distinctly feminine voice with a playful edge spoke, its tone dripping with amusement.

“What is your will, Mistress Nishi?”

Nishi froze, her face draining of color as laughter erupted around the room. She turned slowly, her gaze darting to the loudspeaker. “Oh no…”

“Looks like the Wraith has something to say about that!” Kobayashi crowed, doubling over with laughter.

Nishi buried her face in her hands, mortified. “You have *got* to be kidding me.”

The voice continued, teasingly formal. “Do you require my assistance in this moment of need, or shall I resume my vigil?”

The cafeteria erupted into cheers and applause, with shouts of “Mistress Nishi!” and “Long live the summoner!” echoing through the room. Nishi peeked between her fingers, catching sight of nearly everyone in the cafeteria laughing, clapping, or recording the spectacle on their phones.

Her mortification turned to exasperation as she stomped to the nearest loudspeaker, glaring at it as if the AI could see her. “Stop it. Now.”

“As you command, Mistress,” the Wraith’s voice replied, still brimming with amusement. The loudspeakers crackled again and fell silent.

Nishi turned back to face the room, her face a mix of frustration and resignation. The cheering and laughter didn’t stop, and Kobayashi gave her an exaggerated thumbs-up.

“You know, Lieutenant,” he said between chuckles, “you’re kind of a legend now. Embrace it.”

She groaned, shaking her head as she grabbed her tray and made a beeline for the farthest, emptiest corner of the cafeteria. But even as she sat down, trying to will the ground to swallow her whole, she couldn’t help but hear the whispers that continued around her.

“She really *is* the Wraith’s mistress, isn’t she?”

“Do you think she can summon it right now?”

“I dare you to ask her to!”

Nishi sighed deeply, stabbing her fork into her rice. This was going to be a very long lunch.

## Into the Field

The morning sun glinted off the frost-covered buildings of the Hokkaido facility as the Wraith team gathered near the edge of a sprawling, urban-style training ground. The simulated town was a maze of alleys, mock buildings, and strategically placed obstacles, designed to mimic a densely populated area. High above, drones hovered silently, recording every move for later review.

Lieutenant Nishi stood in front of the team, her tablet in hand, displaying a tactical overview of the exercise. Beside her, the Wraith hummed faintly, its systems already feeding data into her display. The team—Ishikawa, Okabe, Tanaka, and Kuroda—stood in a loose formation, checking their gear and exchanging quiet words of encouragement.

“Alright,” Nishi began, her voice firm but calm, “here’s the scenario: you’re an extraction team tasked with retrieving a high-value asset from hostile territory. The asset”—she gestured to an icon on her map—“is located in this building, marked Objective Alpha. Your mission is to locate, secure, and extract the asset back to the starting point, all while avoiding detection or engagement with the simulated enemy forces.”

She tapped her tablet, and red dots populated the map, representing the enemy patrols. “The enemy units are equipped with conventional surveillance systems, which the Wraith will disrupt, and basic countermeasures to electronic warfare. Your goal is to use the Wraith’s capabilities to outmaneuver them without raising an alarm.”

Okabe smirked, patting his portable console. “So basically, let the Wraith do all the hard work while we stroll through?”

“Not quite,” Nishi said, arching an eyebrow. “The Wraith is your quarterback, but you’re still the ones on the ground. It will provide overwatch, disrupt enemy systems, and feed you real-time intel. How you use that information is up to you.”

Tanaka, always the pragmatist, adjusted his gear. “What about contingencies? If we get spotted?”

“If you’re spotted,” Nishi said, “you’ve already failed. The exercise is designed to test your ability to stay invisible. But if you must engage, the Wraith will assist. Just don’t make it a habit.”

Kuroda, the youngest member, raised a hand. “Are we expecting any countermeasures against the Wraith itself?”

“Minimal,” Nishi replied. “The exercise is focused on your coordination with the platform. That said…” She gestured toward the towering craft behind her. “If the Wraith detects anything capable of interfering with its systems, it’ll neutralize it. Quickly.”

Ishikawa, the team lead, gave a curt nod. “Understood. Let’s gear up.”

Nishi stepped back as the team finished their preparations, watching as they secured their equipment and ran final checks on their comms. The Wraith’s voice chimed in, its calm tone filling the air.

“Team, you are equipped with secure communication links that I will monitor and relay as needed. My systems are fully operational and ready to support. The training grounds are now live. Proceed when ready.”

Ishikawa turned to his team, his tone crisp. “You heard the Wraith. Let’s move out.”

With that, the team slipped into the training ground, their movements precise and coordinated. Nishi remained behind with the Wraith, monitoring the exercise from her tablet. The holographic display projected in front of her showed the team’s positions and the shifting patrol routes of the simulated enemy units.

“Let’s see how they handle this,” Nishi muttered under her breath, her eyes fixed on the display.

The Wraith’s avatar appeared beside her on the display, its tone edged with faint amusement. “They have potential, Lieutenant. Shall we challenge them further?”

Nishi smiled slightly. “Let’s see how they handle the basics first. Then we’ll decide if they’re ready for a curveball.” 

The exercise had begun, and the team’s true test was only just unfolding.

---

### Guided by the Wraith

The team slipped silently into the urban training grounds, the simulated town looming around them in concrete and steel. Each member moved with practiced precision, their boots barely making a sound on the frost-laced pavement. The air was tense, filled with the faint rustle of distant movement as the “enemy” patrols—fellow personnel from the base—searched the area.

“Maintain radio silence unless absolutely necessary,” Ishikawa whispered, his tone commanding. The team acknowledged with subtle nods, their focus razor-sharp.

In their earpieces, the calm, almost serene voice of the Wraith’s AI spoke. “Team, patrol unit approaching from your nine o’clock. Two individuals, lightly armed. Recommend moving east to avoid detection.”

Ishikawa raised a clenched fist, signaling the team to halt. He glanced to his left, spotting the faint shadow of movement where the Wraith had indicated. With a quick gesture, he pointed toward the eastern alleyway. The team moved as one, slipping into the shadows just as the patrol passed.

“Patrol has cleared your area,” the Wraith reported. “Proceed forward. Thirty meters to the next intersection.”

Okabe couldn’t help but grin as he followed. The AI’s voice felt omnipresent, an invisible ally guiding them with an uncanny precision that bordered on supernatural. “This is too smooth,” he whispered under his breath, though no one responded.

---

As they reached the next intersection, Kuroda froze, his sharp eyes catching a faint glint of light reflecting off a weapon. He gestured frantically for the team to stop, and the Wraith’s voice chimed in, calm and measured.

“Enemy sniper positioned at ten o’clock on a second-story balcony. Maintain low profile and advance using the vehicles for cover.”

Tanaka, the team’s CQB specialist, gave a subtle thumbs-up as they moved. One by one, they darted between the abandoned cars and delivery trucks lining the street, keeping to the Wraith’s prescribed path.

Ishikawa paused behind a rusted van, scanning the area ahead. “What’s the sniper’s field of view?” he murmured softly.

The Wraith replied instantly. “He is covering the main street but has limited visibility on your current route. I will monitor and alert if he shifts position.”

“Got it,” Ishikawa muttered, waving the team forward. They moved in careful increments, the sniper’s distant figure barely shifting as they crossed his line of sight unnoticed.

---

Reaching the next checkpoint, the team huddled in the shadows of a crumbling storefront. Okabe pulled out his portable console, his fingers flying over the screen. “This place is crawling,” he muttered, glancing at a local map. “How many more patrols between us and Objective Alpha?”

“Four patrols remain,” the Wraith answered. “Two static, two mobile. I am redirecting the mobile units to create a gap in their coverage. Proceed north when I give the signal.”

Kuroda glanced at Ishikawa, raising an eyebrow. “It’s… moving the patrols?”

“Recommending,” the Wraith clarified, a faint note of amusement in its tone. “Human behavior is predictable. A subtle distraction—such as adjusting their comms traffic—will redirect their attention without raising suspicion.”

Okabe let out a low whistle. “Now that’s next-level manipulation.”

The AI’s voice remained steady. “The manipulation is temporary. Use the window wisely. Signal in three… two… one. Move now.”

Ishikawa motioned forward, and the team sprinted silently across the open stretch, slipping into another alley as the patrols adjusted their routes. The faint sound of footsteps and radio chatter receded into the distance, leaving the team with an eerie silence.

---

As they paused to regroup, Tanaka glanced over at Ishikawa, his voice low. “This thing doesn’t miss a beat. It’s like it’s watching the whole town at once.”

“It is,” Ishikawa said simply. “So don’t screw up.”

The Wraith’s voice returned, its tone devoid of any judgment. “Objective Alpha is two blocks ahead. Minimal enemy presence in your path. Proceed to the indicated waypoint and await further instructions.”

The team exchanged glances, their confidence bolstered by the Wraith’s guidance. Ishikawa gave a quick nod. “Let’s finish this.”

They moved forward, their steps precise and their nerves steady, trusting the invisible hand of the Wraith to guide them through the maze of obstacles and enemies.

---

### Securing the Objective

The team crouched low, their breaths visible in the cold air as they approached the building marked as Objective Alpha. The mock structure was a nondescript, two-story building with boarded windows and a single reinforced door. Kuroda peered through his binoculars, scanning for any sign of guards or traps.

“All clear on the outside,” he whispered.

The Wraith’s calm voice filled their earpieces. “The objective is located on the second floor. The building’s alarm system is active and linked to the main control room. Any unauthorized access will trigger an alert.”

Okabe smirked, patting the small device clipped to his belt. “Good thing we’ve got this little beauty. Let me handle it.”

Tanaka raised a hand. “Wait. What about patrols?”

“Two units are moving toward the southeast perimeter,” the Wraith replied. “Their route will not intersect with your current location for approximately four minutes. Proceed now.”

Ishikawa nodded. “Okabe, you’re up.”

Okabe moved to the reinforced door, pulling out the ICE-pick—a sleek, sharp device with a needle-like probe at its tip. The handle felt cool and solid in his hand as he knelt by the access panel beside the door.

“ICE-pick in position,” Okabe murmured, pressing the device against the panel. With a soft click, the pick’s probe extended, burrowing into the panel’s circuitry. A faint hum indicated it was operational.

“Engaging intrusion countermeasures,” the Wraith announced. “The ICE-pick is interfacing with the alarm system. Stand by.”

Tiny carbon nanofibers snaked out from the device, latching onto the signal buses inside the panel. Okabe’s portable console lit up, displaying streams of data as the Wraith’s AI worked its magic.

“This thing’s fast,” Okabe whispered, impressed as lines of code decrypted before his eyes.

“Alarm system neutralized,” the Wraith confirmed moments later. “You may proceed without detection.”

Okabe grinned as he stowed the ICE-pick. “Too easy.”

---

Inside the building, the team moved with precision, clearing each room as they ascended to the second floor. The objective—a secure case marked with Federation logos—sat on a table in the corner, illuminated by the faint glow of a nearby desk lamp.

“Objective secured,” Kuroda reported, lifting the case carefully. “No traps or tampering. Ready to exfil.”

The Wraith’s voice chimed in. “Well done. Exit the building and proceed to the extraction point. Avoid unnecessary engagement.”

Ishikawa nodded. “Let’s move.”

The team retraced their steps, exiting the building and slipping into the alley behind it. The streets were eerily quiet, the faint crunch of their boots against the frosty ground the only sound.

---

As they neared the halfway point to the extraction zone, the Wraith’s voice suddenly broke the silence, a faint urgency creeping into its tone. “Alert. Multiple patrols entering the training grounds. Their routes are converging toward your position.”

Ishikawa held up a fist, signaling the team to halt. “How many?”

“Six patrols,” the Wraith replied. “Each unit consists of two operatives. Their movements suggest a coordinated search pattern.”

“Looks like they’re stepping up the game,” Tanaka muttered, gripping his weapon tightly.

“What’s the plan?” Kuroda asked, his voice tense.

The Wraith spoke again, its tone steady. “I am rerouting two patrols to create a potential exit corridor. However, timing is critical. You must evade detection while proceeding to the extraction point.”

Ishikawa’s jaw tightened as he scanned the map displayed on his portable console. “Alright, stay sharp. We’re threading the needle on this one.”

The team adjusted their formation, moving swiftly but cautiously as the patrols closed in. The tension in the air was palpable, every shadow and sound a potential threat. The exercise had escalated, and the next few minutes would determine whether they could finish the mission—or face the consequences of failure.

---

### The Great Escape

The team moved swiftly but silently through the urban training grounds, their breaths shallow as tension coiled around them. The faint hum of the Wraith’s voice in their earpieces was the only thing keeping them from breaking into a full sprint.

“Patrol unit moving toward your position,” the AI announced calmly. “Take the next right and proceed to the alley behind the convenience store.”

Ishikawa raised a clenched fist, halting the team momentarily. He pointed to the right, signaling the direction. They slipped into the narrow alley as instructed, their footsteps muffled on the frost-coated pavement. The shadows of the simulated town seemed to stretch unnaturally long, masking their movements as they crept along.

“Unit has passed your location,” the Wraith’s voice reported. “Continue forward, forty meters.”

---

As the team advanced, Okabe glanced at his portable console, monitoring the patrols’ positions. “This thing’s threading needles for us,” he muttered under his breath.

“It’s not luck,” Kuroda whispered back. “It’s reading everything. Predicting moves before they happen.”

“It’s the only reason we’re not spotted yet,” Tanaka added, his voice low but firm. “Stay focused.”

Ishikawa raised a hand for silence, and the team froze. A faint sound—a scuff of boots on pavement—came from the street ahead.

“Static patrol positioned at the intersection,” the Wraith informed them. “Two operatives. They have not detected you.”

“Suggestions?” Ishikawa murmured.

The Wraith responded instantly. “Diversion deployed. Remote activation of a streetlight behind the patrol will draw their attention. Proceed when the area is clear.”

A second later, a faint click echoed through the air as a flickering streetlight behind the patrol buzzed to life. The two operatives turned, their attention drawn to the unexpected disturbance.

“Now,” the Wraith instructed.

Ishikawa gestured for the team to move, and they slipped across the intersection, hugging the shadows as the patrol remained distracted. Once safely on the other side, they pressed deeper into the alleyways.

---

The extraction zone was now just two blocks away, but the Wraith’s voice returned with a faint edge of urgency. “Alert. A patrol is converging on your location from the east. Time to intercept: forty-five seconds. Recommend immediate movement to cover.”

Ishikawa scanned their surroundings quickly, spotting a narrow staircase leading to the roof of a nearby building. He pointed toward it. “Up. Now.”

The team ascended quickly, their boots clanging softly against the metal steps. Reaching the rooftop, they crouched low, scanning for the approaching patrol. Below, two operatives swept the alley with flashlights, their beams cutting through the gloom.

“Hold position,” the Wraith instructed. “The patrol will clear in twenty seconds.”

The team stayed perfectly still, their breaths shallow as they watched the patrol move past. Once the alley was clear, the Wraith spoke again. “Proceed along the rooftop to the west. Extraction point is one block away.”

---

Reaching the final stretch, the team descended another set of stairs and sprinted across an open courtyard, the extraction point in sight. A faint shimmer in the air marked the Wraith’s cloaked form, waiting for them.

“Final approach,” Ishikawa whispered, his voice taut.

As the team crossed the threshold into the extraction zone, the Wraith decloaked, its ramp extending with a smooth, mechanical hiss. The glow of its interior beckoned like a safe haven, and the team didn’t hesitate. They filed in quickly, their adrenaline still pumping.

“Exercise complete,” the Wraith announced as the ramp retracted and the craft sealed itself. “Mission success. All objectives secured.”

The team exhaled collectively, their tension finally breaking. Ishikawa leaned against the wall, his hands on his knees as he caught his breath. “That was… something else.”

Kuroda grinned, his face still flushed from the exertion. “We didn’t just thread a needle. We threaded a whole sewing machine.”

Okabe chuckled, wiping sweat from his brow. “I don’t know what’s more impressive—the Wraith’s precision or the fact that we kept up.”

Tanaka remained quiet, his steady demeanor unshaken as he checked his gear. “Next time, we’ll be even faster.”

Nishi’s voice came over the comms, calm but tinged with pride. “You did well. We’ll review the footage later, but for now… enjoy the win.”

The Wraith lifted off silently, carrying the team back toward the facility. Below, the training grounds returned to their quiet stillness, the exercise complete—but the team knew this was just the beginning.

---

### After-Action Debrief

The Wraith sat on its newly constructed landing pad, the sleek craft gleaming faintly under the facility’s overhead lights. Its angular frame loomed like a predatory shadow, a stark contrast to the utilitarian surroundings of the base. Maintenance crews bustled around it, inspecting the pad and ensuring the area was secure. 

Inside, the atmosphere was a mix of exhaustion and anticipation as the team settled into the Wraith’s briefing chamber—a sleek, minimalist space with holographic displays lining the walls. Lieutenant Nishi entered moments later, followed by Commander Takeda, whose sharp gaze swept over the room with practiced authority.

“Good work out there,” Nishi began, her tone calm but firm. She gestured for the team to sit as she activated a console, bringing up a holographic map of the training grounds. Key points in the exercise were marked in bright colors, showing the team’s movements and the enemy patrols.

Commander Takeda took a position near the wall, arms crossed as he watched silently. His presence added a weight to the room, though his expression betrayed little of what he thought.

The Wraith’s avatar materialized in the center of the room, its sleek, feminine form a subtle nod to its AI persona. “Shall we begin the debrief?” it asked, its voice smooth and professional.

“Start with the objective,” Nishi instructed, nodding to the AI.

A section of the holographic map zoomed in, focusing on the building where the team had secured the asset. The playback began, showing the team’s approach, the use of the ICE-pick to disable the alarm, and the extraction of the objective.

“The asset retrieval was executed with precision,” the Wraith noted. “The ICE-pick performed flawlessly, neutralizing the alarm system in under ten seconds. Team coordination was effective, with minimal delays in movement.”

Okabe smirked, leaning back in his chair. “I told you that ICE-pick was magic.”

“Magic,” Takeda repeated dryly, his eyes narrowing at Okabe. “It’s technology, and it worked because you followed protocol. Let’s not get complacent.”

Okabe straightened slightly under Takeda’s gaze, his smirk fading.

The playback continued, showing the team navigating the patrols. Kuroda leaned forward, studying the holograms. “The diversions were perfect. How did you pull that off?”

The Wraith’s avatar turned slightly toward him. “I utilized the facility’s existing systems, triggering subtle anomalies that redirected the patrols without raising suspicion. For example, adjusting the timing of automated lights or creating phantom comms traffic to draw attention elsewhere.”

“Subtle, efficient, and it worked,” Ishikawa said, nodding. “The timing was tight, but it felt like you had everything mapped out.”

The Wraith’s tone carried a faint note of approval. “Indeed. Your ability to follow instructions and adapt to dynamic changes contributed significantly to the mission’s success.”

---

The holograms shifted, replaying the final stretch of the exercise—the rooftop evasion, the courtyard sprint, and the team’s boarding of the Wraith. Commander Takeda’s expression remained unreadable as he observed the footage.

“This section,” Takeda said, pointing to the map, “was the most critical. The increased patrol density could have trapped you. What were your thoughts during this phase?”

Ishikawa glanced at his team before answering. “We trusted the Wraith. It had a bird’s-eye view, so when it said to go to the roof, we didn’t question it.”

“It worked,” Tanaka added. “But if we’d hesitated for even a few seconds, it could’ve gone sideways.”

“Exactly,” Takeda said, his tone sharp. “That’s where discipline matters. Trusting the platform is essential, but so is executing immediately. You can’t afford second-guessing when you’re on the ground.”

Nishi stepped in, her voice more measured. “And you didn’t. That’s what matters. The exercise was a success, and the coordination between the team and the Wraith is improving. This was a solid step forward.”

The Wraith’s avatar turned to face Takeda. “Commander, do you have additional feedback or directives for future training sessions?”

Takeda considered for a moment, then spoke. “Increase the complexity. Add environmental factors—weather simulations, noise interference, maybe even civilian NPCs to force the team to make harder decisions. They did well today, but real-world missions won’t be this clean.”

The Wraith inclined its head slightly. “Understood. Adjustments will be implemented for the next session.”

---

As the debrief concluded, Nishi turned to the team, a small smile breaking through her otherwise serious demeanor. “You’ve all come a long way in just a few sessions. Keep it up. The better we get here, the more prepared we’ll be when it matters.”

The team nodded, their expressions a mix of pride and determination. As they filed out, Takeda lingered for a moment, his gaze lingering on the Wraith’s avatar.

“This thing really is something else,” he muttered before turning to Nishi. “Keep pushing them, Lieutenant. And make sure the Wraith stays in line. Even the best tools need a firm hand.”

Nishi nodded, watching as Takeda exited the chamber. When the door closed, she let out a quiet breath, glancing at the Wraith’s avatar.

“Not bad for their first real test,” she said softly.

“Agreed,” the Wraith replied. “They show potential. With time, they may exceed expectations.”

“Let’s hope so,” Nishi murmured, her gaze shifting to the holographic map still glowing faintly in the air. The mission might have been simulated, but the stakes felt very real.

### Dinner Discussions

The cafeteria was alive with the usual hum of conversation as the team settled into their usual corner. Trays clattered as marines, analysts, and operatives lined up for their meals, but the Wraith team’s table had already begun to attract attention. Word of their successful training exercise had spread fast, and the surrounding tables were packed with curious personnel eager for details.

Okabe, as usual, was holding court, leaning back in his chair with a grin as he recounted their escape from the rooftop. “I’m telling you, that last stretch was like threading a needle blindfolded. If the Wraith hadn’t been feeding us those patrol routes, we’d have been toast.”

Tanaka rolled his eyes, shoveling a forkful of rice into his mouth. “Yeah, sure. Except it was Ishikawa who actually got us through that rooftop mess. You were too busy staring at your console.”

“That console is the reason we didn’t get caught,” Okabe shot back, holding up his fork as if to make a point. “Besides, the Wraith practically spoon-fed us the win.”

Kuroda chuckled, sipping his tea. “I don’t think the Wraith’s going to let you take credit for its work.”

At the table next to theirs, a marine in his mid-twenties leaned over, his curiosity getting the better of him. “Speaking of the Wraith, what’s the deal with that *Wraith Girl* thing? Is it true the avatar looks like something out of an anime?”

Okabe grinned, leaning forward. “Oh, you have no idea. The first time we met her—well, it—the avatar tried on, like, five different looks. We had a military officer, some shrine maiden, a battleship girl—”

“Wait, wait, wait,” interrupted a female officer from another table, her brows shooting up. She stood and approached their group, hands on her hips. “Are you telling me this AI was cosplaying on duty?”

The table erupted into laughter, and Okabe nodded, his grin widening. “Pretty much. It was like being in an anime convention. I half-expected it to pull out a magical wand or something.”

The female officer crossed her arms, a playful smirk on her lips. “You’ve got to be kidding me. I bust my butt keeping this base running, and meanwhile, your AI’s living the otaku dream.”

“You’re just jealous,” Kuroda teased, leaning back in his chair. “I mean, it *is* kind of amazing. It didn’t even hesitate—just shifted between forms like it was trying on outfits.”

The officer raised an eyebrow, her smirk growing. “Jealous? Of course, I am! You get to work with a hyper-advanced AI that apparently has a better wardrobe than I do.”

Okabe chuckled, shrugging. “Hey, if it helps us not get shot, I’m all for it. Magical girl or not, the Wraith gets the job done.”

The marine who had asked the question shook his head in disbelief. “Man, I thought the Wraith was supposed to be this terrifying piece of Federation tech. Now you’re making it sound like it belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon.”

“It can be both,” Kuroda said with a grin. “It’s like a friendly nightmare.”

The female officer pulled up a chair, her curiosity undeterred. “Alright, spill. Which avatar was the most ridiculous?”

Okabe opened his mouth to answer, but Tanaka cut him off, his tone dry. “None of them were ridiculous. It was just trying to figure out what worked best for us. Professional. Tactical. Not whatever he’s about to say.”

“You’re no fun,” Okabe muttered, leaning back in mock disappointment.

---

The table buzzed with laughter and banter as the team continued sharing stories, the lighthearted mood a welcome reprieve from the day’s intensity. The other marines and operatives nearby leaned in, eager to hear more, their interest piqued by the blend of awe-inspiring tech and unexpected humor.

But even as the jokes flowed, there was an undercurrent of curiosity—questions about the Wraith’s true nature, its capabilities, and how much it might change the way they operated. For now, though, the team was content to enjoy the moment, letting the camaraderie ease the tension of their high-stakes mission.

### Scene: The Wraith’s Playful Encore

The laughter and chatter in the cafeteria grew louder as more personnel joined the impromptu storytelling. The team was still regaling the gathered crowd with tales of their training when Lieutenant Nishi entered, tray in hand. Her presence immediately drew attention, and a few people turned toward her with expectant grins.

“Well, well,” Okabe said, waving her over. “If it isn’t our fearless leader.”

“I’m not your leader,” Nishi replied, rolling her eyes as she set her tray down at their table. “I just keep the paperwork in order.”

Lieutenant Hoshino, still seated near the team, raised an eyebrow. “Speaking of leadership, care to explain why your AI is moonlighting as an anime character wardrobe model?”

Nishi froze mid-reach for her tea, blinking at the question. “What are you talking about?”

“The Wraith Girl,” Hoshino said, smirking. “Your AI. These guys were telling me about how it tried on every anime-inspired outfit imaginable during your first meeting. Shrine maidens, battleship girls, you name it. Is that standard Federation protocol, or is it just trying to impress?”

Nishi sighed, rubbing her temples. “It’s… not like that. It was trying to make the team comfortable, that’s all.”

“Comfortable?” Okabe interjected, grinning. “I’d call it a cosplay fashion show.”

Before Nishi could respond, her phone pinged with a notification. She glanced at the screen, her brow furrowing as she read the message:

> **Wraith:**  
> *Turn on the cafeteria’s movie screen. Trust me.*

Nishi groaned softly, already bracing herself for whatever the AI had planned. “Of course.”

“What’s up?” Ishikawa asked, noticing her hesitation.

“The Wraith wants me to turn on the screen,” she muttered.

“Oh, this I have to see,” Okabe said, leaning forward eagerly.

Nishi sighed again and walked over to the console controlling the cafeteria’s movie screen. With a few taps, the large screen at the front of the room flickered to life, and the cafeteria speakers hummed softly. The crowd quieted, curious about what was happening.

The screen turned dark, and then the Wraith’s avatar appeared—a sleek, minimalist figure standing confidently in the center of the display.

“Good evening, personnel of the Hokkaido facility,” the Wraith’s voice rang out, smooth and playful. “I hear there’s been some interest in my choice of avatars.”

Laughter rippled through the room, and Hoshino leaned back in her chair, grinning. “You could say that.”

“Well, Lieutenant Hoshino,” the Wraith continued, its tone light and teasing, “let’s make this a bit more interactive, shall we?”

The avatar shifted seamlessly into a new form: a traditional shrine maiden with long flowing hair, holding a broom in one hand. “Perhaps this was what they were describing?” it said, striking a dramatic pose.

The room erupted into laughter and applause. Hoshino raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “Not bad, Wraith Girl. What else have you got?”

The avatar transformed again, this time into a cheerful battleship-inspired character, complete with mechanical appendages and a captain’s hat. “Or maybe something more naval?” the Wraith asked, giving a playful salute.

“You’re really leaning into this,” Kuroda said, barely containing his laughter.

Hoshino stood, hands on her hips. “Alright, show me a magical girl transformation. Full sparkles.”

“As you wish,” the Wraith replied smoothly.

The screen lit up with an over-the-top animation sequence: glowing stars, swirling ribbons, and shimmering sparkles that coalesced into a vibrant magical girl avatar, complete with a wand and exaggerated poses. The cafeteria burst into laughter, several people clapping and cheering.

“Now you’re just showing off,” Hoshino said, though her grin betrayed her enjoyment. “Alright, my turn to make a request: let’s see something sci-fi.”

The Wraith’s avatar morphed again, this time into a sleek, futuristic design with glowing panels and a holographic visor. Its voice shifted to a more robotic tone. “Initializing combat protocols,” it said dramatically, eliciting more laughter.

The room buzzed with energy as others joined in, shouting suggestions.

“Do a ninja!” someone called out.

“Space pirate!” another voice added.

“Giant robot!” shouted a marine from the back.

The Wraith obliged each request with flair, shifting between forms with fluid precision, its playful tone keeping the mood light and entertaining. The cafeteria had turned into an impromptu theater, with the Wraith as the star of the show.

Nishi, meanwhile, sat at the edge of the chaos, burying her face in her hands. “I can’t believe this is happening,” she muttered.

“Come on, Lieutenant,” Okabe said, grinning at her. “Even you have to admit, it’s kind of fun.”

Nishi peeked through her fingers, her exasperation giving way to a reluctant smile. “It’s something, alright.”

The scene continued, the Wraith’s avatars drawing laughter, cheers, and the occasional groan from the gathered crowd. But beneath the humor, there was a palpable sense of camaraderie—a rare moment of levity in a high-stakes environment.

### Closing the Night

As the laughter in the cafeteria began to subside, the Wraith’s avatar transitioned back to its default sleek, minimalist form. The screen dimmed slightly, and the AI’s voice spoke, still carrying a playful warmth.

“Thank you for indulging me. Even an AI enjoys a bit of levity now and then. Goodnight, personnel of Hokkaido. Sleep well—your efforts today were commendable.”

A smattering of applause broke out, mingled with chuckles as the screen faded to black. The cafeteria lights brightened slightly, signaling the end of the impromptu show. 

Lieutenant Hoshino stretched her arms over her head, her smirk lingering as she turned back to the Wraith team. “Alright, I’ll admit it—that was impressive. And fun. But next time, maybe let me borrow the magical girl wand. I’ve got a few people I’d like to hex.”

“That can probably be arranged,” Okabe quipped, eliciting another round of laughter.

Ishikawa stood, sliding his chair back. “Alright, let’s wrap it up. Big day tomorrow.”

The other members of the team followed his lead, gathering their trays and offering good-natured farewells to the other personnel still lingering. The energy in the room began to settle as people filed out, their faces still glowing with amusement from the unexpected entertainment.

Lieutenant Nishi stood by the door, watching as the cafeteria emptied. A few marines and analysts waved goodnight as they passed, their smiles genuine.

“Thanks for the laughs, Lieutenant,” one of them said. “It’s good to remember we can still have fun.”

Nishi nodded, her expression softening. “Goodnight. Get some rest.”

---

As the last of the personnel filtered out, Nishi turned to her team, who lingered by the doorway. “Alright, you’re all dismissed. And maybe next time, don’t encourage the Wraith so much.”

“We’re not the ones who turned on the screen,” Okabe said with a grin.

Nishi shook her head, half-smiling despite herself. “Just… go get some sleep.”

As the team headed toward the dormitories, the base grew quieter, the day’s excitement giving way to the calm of night. The Wraith remained parked on its pad, its sleek silhouette a silent reminder of the challenges ahead.

But for now, there was peace—and for the people of the Hokkaido facility, a renewed sense of camaraderie as they prepared to face whatever came next.

## Into the Lion’s Den

The briefing room at the Hokkaido facility was dimly lit, the only illumination coming from the holographic map projected over the central table. General Saito stood at the head of the room, his posture stiff, his gaze intense. Around the table, Ishikawa, Okabe, Tanaka, and Kuroda sat in silence, their attention fixed on the detailed layout of a sprawling North Korean missile development facility.

Lieutenant Nishi leaned against the wall near the back, her tablet in hand. The Wraith’s avatar stood beside her, its minimalistic form blending into the room’s subdued light, its presence a quiet reminder of the Federation’s watchful eye.

“This is your first live mission,” General Saito began, his voice sharp and authoritative. “No simulations. No controlled environments. You will be operating in hostile territory with no backup. Success depends on your ability to remain undetected. Is that understood?”

“Yes, sir,” Ishikawa replied, his tone steady. The rest of the team echoed the sentiment with nods and murmurs.

Saito tapped a control on the table, and the holographic map zoomed in on the missile development facility, highlighting key areas. “Your objective is to infiltrate this building”—he pointed to a structure in the heart of the compound—“and retrieve the schematics and calculations for North Korea’s next-generation ballistic missile program. Intelligence suggests these plans are nearing finalization, and we cannot allow that to happen.”

The hologram shifted, displaying a detailed floor plan of the facility. “The data is stored on an isolated network. You will need to copy it onto this,” he said, holding up a small, encrypted data drive, “and extract it without alerting the facility’s personnel. If you’re discovered, the entire mission is compromised.”

Okabe leaned forward, eyeing the map. “How tight is their security?”

“Very tight,” Saito said bluntly. “The compound is patrolled by armed guards and monitored by a combination of CCTV and motion sensors. The missile plans are stored in a secure lab on the second floor, which is protected by biometric access controls. You’ll need to bypass those without leaving a trace.”

Tanaka crossed his arms. “Any intel on their patrol patterns or response times?”

“We’ve identified gaps in their patrols, but they’re minimal,” Saito replied. “The Wraith will guide you in real-time to exploit those openings. But be warned: their response times are fast. If an alarm is triggered, you’ll have less than ninety seconds before they lock the facility down.”

“Sounds cozy,” Kuroda muttered, earning a sharp glance from Ishikawa.

Nishi stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. “The Wraith will also provide electronic warfare support. It can disable cameras and sensors, redirect patrols, and feed false data into their systems, but only for short bursts. The facility’s internal security network is heavily shielded, so prolonged interference will trigger failsafes.”

Okabe smirked, tapping the console at his side. “So it’s on us to move fast and clean. No pressure.”

Saito ignored the comment, continuing with his briefing. “You’ll infiltrate the facility via this access point”—he gestured to a maintenance tunnel on the map—“located here on the northern perimeter. The tunnel leads directly beneath the main building, providing you with a covert entry route. Once inside, you’ll make your way to the second floor, retrieve the data, and exfiltrate using the same route.”

“And if we’re compromised?” Ishikawa asked.

“If that happens,” Saito said, his tone hardening, “your priority is the data. Extract it at all costs. The Wraith will provide overwatch and, if necessary, deploy countermeasures to cover your escape. But let me be clear: failure is not an option.”

The room fell silent, the weight of the mission settling over the team. Ishikawa stood, his expression resolute. “Understood, sir. We’ll get it done.”

Saito nodded, his gaze sweeping over the team. “Good. You deploy at 2200 hours. Gear up and make your final preparations. Dismissed.”

As the team rose and filed out of the room, Nishi lingered behind with the Wraith. The AI’s avatar turned to her, its voice low and measured. “This mission is critical, Lieutenant. Success here will establish the team’s effectiveness in live operations.”

Nishi nodded, her grip tightening on her tablet. “They’ll be ready. They have to be.” 

The Wraith’s avatar flickered briefly, its calm demeanor unwavering. “Then let us ensure they succeed.” 

With that, Nishi stepped out of the briefing room, her thoughts already racing. The team’s first mission was about to begin, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.

### Departure

The Wraith loomed on its custom-built pad, its sleek, black surface blending into the night like a predator preparing to pounce. The facility buzzed with quiet activity as the team finished their final checks. Ishikawa, Okabe, Tanaka, and Kuroda stood at the base of the ramp, their gear secured, their expressions a mix of determination and anticipation.

Lieutenant Nishi stood a few paces away, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. She wasn’t a field operative—her place was behind the scenes—but the weight of the mission still pressed heavily on her shoulders. She stepped forward, stopping just short of the team.

“Last-minute reminders,” she said, her voice steady despite the knot in her stomach. “Stick to the plan. Trust the Wraith. And above all, stay focused.”

Ishikawa nodded, his gaze firm. “We’ll get it done.”

Okabe grinned, trying to inject some levity into the tense atmosphere. “You’ll be glued to your console the whole time anyway, right? Watching over us?”

Nishi rolled her eyes but allowed a faint smile to slip through. “Someone has to make sure you don’t get yourselves killed.”

Kuroda adjusted the strap of his pack, glancing up the ramp. “The Wraith’s got our backs. Just keep the home front running.”

“I’ll handle things here,” Nishi replied, her voice softening. “You focus on the mission. And remember—this is just the beginning. Prove you can do this, and there’ll be more to come.”

Tanaka, ever the stoic, gave a small nod of acknowledgment. “We won’t let you down.”

The Wraith’s avatar flickered into view on a nearby display, its calm, feminine voice cutting through the quiet. “The team is ready for departure. All systems are operational. Lieutenant, I will provide you with real-time updates from the field.”

Nishi gave the avatar a curt nod, her expression tightening. “Good. Keep me posted on everything.”

The Wraith’s ramp began to retract as the team boarded, their boots clanging softly against the metal. Ishikawa turned at the top, giving Nishi a final nod. “See you on the other side.”

“Good luck,” she called after them, her voice carrying more emotion than she intended.

The ramp sealed with a soft hiss, and moments later, the Wraith’s engines hummed to life. The craft lifted smoothly off the pad, its cloaking systems activating almost instantly. Within seconds, it was gone, a faint shimmer in the night sky the only sign it had ever been there.

Nishi stood alone on the pad for a moment, the cold night air biting at her skin. She clenched her fists, willing herself to focus. There was no room for doubt or hesitation now.

Turning on her heel, she headed back toward the command center. Her role might not be on the ground, but she was just as much a part of the mission as the team—and she intended to do everything in her power to see them through it.

### Naming the Phantom

The Wraith soared silently through the night sky, its cloaking systems active and its engines emitting only a faint hum. Inside the craft, the team sat strapped into their seats in the main cabin, going over the final details of the mission. The mood was focused but not tense; they had trained for this, and the Wraith’s steady guidance was a constant reassurance.

Okabe, unable to resist breaking the quiet, leaned back with a smirk. “You know, for all the talking we do about the Wraith, we’ve never actually given it a proper callsign.”

Tanaka raised an eyebrow. “Does it need one? It’s already got a name.”

“Sure,” Okabe replied, “but ‘the Wraith’ is… I don’t know. It’s too on-the-nose. We need something cooler. More personal.”

“Personal?” Ishikawa asked, his tone skeptical. “It’s not a person.”

Okabe grinned. “Not yet. But have you *seen* the way it acts? It’s got more personality than half the people on base.”

Kuroda chuckled. “Alright, fine. If we’re going to give it a callsign, what do you have in mind?”

Okabe rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “How about ‘Kitsune’? It’s sneaky, clever, and always one step ahead.”

The Wraith’s avatar appeared on a nearby console, its sleek, minimalistic form tilting its head slightly as it listened. “Kitsune,” it repeated, its tone neutral. “A fox spirit from Japanese mythology. Associated with cunning and deception. An acceptable analogy.”

Tanaka frowned, arms crossed. “Not bad, but it feels a little… obvious. Foxes are tricksters, but the Wraith is more than that. It’s precise.”

Kuroda nodded. “What about ‘Tengu’? Agile, tactical, and deadly. Fits, right?”

The Wraith’s avatar flickered briefly, as if considering. “Tengu. A legendary being with martial prowess and keen insight. Also associated with chaos and rebellion. Interesting, but not ideal.”

Okabe leaned forward, his grin widening. “Alright, alright, I’ve got it. How about ‘Nue’? It’s mysterious, unpredictable, and it’s got all those crazy parts from different creatures. Perfect for something that can do everything you do.”

The Wraith’s avatar paused, its glowing eyes narrowing slightly as if in thought. “Nue. A legendary creature of Japanese folklore, described as having a tiger’s body, a snake’s tail, a monkey’s face, and the wings of a bird. An amalgamation of capabilities… intriguing.”

The avatar flickered again, and when it reappeared, its sleek form had changed. Now, asymmetrical, feathered wings adorned its back, reminiscent of the Nue from *Touhou Project*. The Wraith’s voice carried a faint note of amusement as it spoke. “The designation is appropriate. I accept. From this point forward, you may call me ‘Nue.’”

Kuroda laughed softly. “It even changed its look to match. You’ve got to admit, that’s pretty cool.”

Ishikawa nodded, a small smirk tugging at his lips. “Alright, ‘Nue’ it is. Let’s just hope it lives up to the name.”

“Naturally,” the Wraith—now Nue—replied, its tone calm and confident. “I will ensure that your faith in me is justified.”

Okabe leaned back, arms crossed behind his head. “See? I told you it needed a callsign. Nue’s perfect.”

The team chuckled, the brief moment of levity easing the tension as they drew closer to their destination. The Wraith—Nue—adjusted its course, the shimmering expanse of North Korean territory stretching out below them.

“All systems remain nominal,” Nue reported. “Mission parameters are unchanged. We will arrive at the designated insertion point in ten minutes.”

Ishikawa straightened, his voice turning serious. “Alright, everyone, focus up. Let’s get ready to move.”

The cabin grew quiet again as the team prepared for the mission ahead, the faint hum of Nue’s systems a steady reminder of the powerful ally guiding them into the lion’s den.

### The Infiltration Begins

The Wraith—Nue—hovered silently above the darkened expanse of North Korean territory, its cloaking systems rendering it invisible to radar and the naked eye. The team stood near the ramp, their gear checked and double-checked, their focus razor-sharp. Below them, the sprawling missile development facility was a maze of steel, concrete, and sharp-edged geometry, lit only by dim security lights.

“Nue,” Ishikawa said into his earpiece, “status on the patrols?”

The AI’s voice came through, calm and clear. “Two units patrolling the northern perimeter, both moving east. Their paths will intersect at the maintenance tunnel access point in approximately five minutes. Recommend immediate deployment to capitalize on the gap.”

Ishikawa nodded, turning to the team. “You heard her. Let’s move.”

The ramp lowered with a faint hiss, revealing the cold night air. The team filed out quickly and silently, their boots touching down on the soft grass near the edge of the facility’s perimeter. Nue hovered briefly, its form shimmering faintly in the moonlight before ascending back into the darkness, its engines a barely audible hum.

“Proceed southeast,” Nue instructed. “The patrols are converging. Use the cover of the maintenance tunnel entrance.”

The team moved as one, their movements practiced and precise. Kuroda took point, his keen eyes scanning the area ahead. Okabe followed close behind, his portable console already active and feeding him real-time data from Nue’s systems. Tanaka covered the rear, his posture tense but controlled.

As they reached the entrance to the maintenance tunnel, Kuroda raised a hand, signaling for the team to stop. He crouched low, peering through his binoculars at the distant shadows of the approaching patrols.

“They’re close,” he murmured. “Two guards, lightly armed.”

“Nue?” Ishikawa prompted.

“The patrols will cross paths in twenty seconds,” Nue replied. “I have triggered a subtle anomaly in their communications. This will delay their progress by an additional fifteen seconds. Move now.”

Ishikawa motioned for the team to advance. They slipped into the shadows, hugging the side of the building as they approached the tunnel’s access point. The heavy steel door was secured with a keypad lock, its small red light blinking steadily.

“Okabe, you’re up,” Ishikawa whispered.

“On it,” Okabe muttered, pulling the ICE-pick from his pack. He pressed the sleek device against the keypad, and its needle-like probe extended with a soft click. His console lit up as Nue’s systems interfaced with the lock.

“Bypassing,” Nue reported. “Ten seconds.”

The team froze as the faint sound of footsteps echoed nearby. The patrol was closer than expected. Kuroda glanced at Ishikawa, his expression tense, but Ishikawa held up a hand, signaling him to stay calm.

The ICE-pick’s probe retracted with a faint beep, and the red light on the keypad turned green. Okabe grinned, stepping aside as Ishikawa pulled the door open just enough for the team to slip inside. They entered quickly, closing the door behind them just as the patrol’s shadows stretched across the ground outside.

“Door secured,” Nue confirmed. “The patrols will not detect your entry. Proceed through the tunnel. Next objective: access the facility’s interior without triggering motion sensors.”

---

Inside the maintenance tunnel, the air was cool and damp, the faint hum of machinery reverberating through the narrow passage. The team moved in silence, their footsteps muffled against the concrete floor. Nue’s voice guided them at regular intervals, providing updates on the facility’s security systems and patrol movements.

“Motion sensors are active at the tunnel exit,” Nue warned. “I am deploying countermeasures to disable them temporarily. You will have a fifteen-second window to pass through undetected.”

“Understood,” Ishikawa replied. He glanced at the team, his voice low but firm. “When we get to the end, move fast and stay close.”

As they reached the tunnel’s end, Nue spoke again. “Countermeasures active. Proceed now.”

The team surged forward, slipping through the exit and into the shadowed interior of the facility. Beyond the immediate darkness, the faint glow of security lights illuminated a sprawling maze of corridors and labs.

“Initial phase complete,” Nue reported. “You are now inside the facility. Proceed to the second floor. I will guide you to the secure lab housing the missile schematics.”

Ishikawa turned to his team, his voice steady. “We’re in. Stay sharp. This is where things get serious.”

The team nodded, their expressions resolute. The first step of the mission was complete, but the real challenge lay ahead. With Nue’s guidance, they moved deeper into the facility, their nerves steady as they prepared for the next phase of the operation.

### The First Floor

The air inside the missile development facility was cold and sterile, the faint hum of machinery providing an eerie soundtrack to the team’s movements. The corridors were dimly lit, casting long shadows that flickered slightly as the team passed. Every step felt heavier as the weight of the mission settled in. So far, they had remained undetected, but the tension was palpable.

Ishikawa held up a hand, signaling the team to stop. He crouched low, peering around the corner into a hallway bathed in pale fluorescent light. His earpiece crackled softly as Nue’s voice came through.

“Two guards stationed near the central control room, fifty meters ahead,” Nue said. “They are stationary and armed, but not currently on alert. Recommend avoiding direct engagement. Alternative route available.”

“Where?” Ishikawa whispered.

A holographic map from Okabe’s portable console projected in midair, highlighting a narrow service corridor branching off from their current position. “The service corridor bypasses the control room,” Nue explained. “Minimal security measures, but surveillance cameras are active. I will disable them briefly as you pass.”

“Understood,” Ishikawa replied. He turned to the team, gesturing toward the bypass. “Service corridor. Stay low, move fast.”

The team nodded, falling into formation as they slipped silently down the hallway. The muffled hum of the facility’s systems filled the air, masking their footsteps. They reached the service corridor entrance—a plain steel door with a simple access panel.

Okabe stepped forward, quickly interfacing his ICE-pick with the panel. The device hummed softly as Nue worked her digital magic.

“Bypassing lock,” Nue said, her voice calm. “Five seconds.”

The door clicked open, and the team filed into the narrow service corridor. It was cramped, the walls lined with pipes and conduit, but it provided the concealment they needed. Okabe glanced at his console as they moved, the holographic map updating in real-time with their position.

---

Halfway through the service corridor, Nue’s voice returned, quieter this time. “Camera ahead, approximately ten meters. Disabling… now.”

A faint flicker of light from the camera’s lens confirmed her words as the device powered down. Ishikawa led the way, his movements precise as he guided the team past the dormant surveillance. As they cleared the area, Nue spoke again.

“Camera reactivated. No anomalies detected. Continue forward.”

Kuroda let out a soft breath, his voice barely audible. “Feels like she’s playing chess, ten moves ahead.”

“More like twenty,” Okabe muttered, his eyes still glued to his console. “Let’s hope it stays that way.”

At the end of the service corridor, they reached another door. This one was heavier, reinforced with a keypad and biometric scanner. Okabe frowned as he examined it. “This’ll take a little longer.”

“No need,” Nue interjected. “The biometric scanner has a vulnerability. Stand by.”

The scanner’s green light blinked faintly, then turned solid as a soft chime echoed in the corridor. The door unlocked with a hiss. Okabe raised an eyebrow, impressed. “You really don’t mess around.”

“I strive for efficiency,” Nue replied. “Proceed carefully. The area beyond this door has light patrol activity.”

---

The team entered the facility’s main first-floor corridor, a stark contrast to the utilitarian service passage they had just traversed. The walls were lined with reinforced glass panels, giving glimpses into laboratories filled with humming equipment and neatly arranged workstations. Dim light filters created an almost dreamlike quality, the faint buzz of fluorescent bulbs adding to the surreal atmosphere.

“Patrol approaching from the east corridor,” Nue warned. “Two guards, armed. They are stationary but may begin moving soon.”

Ishikawa motioned for the team to take cover behind a row of support beams. They crouched low, their eyes fixed on the intersection ahead where the patrol was stationed. Kuroda peeked around the edge, his binoculars focusing on the guards.

“They’re just standing there,” he whispered. “Looks like they’re chatting.”

“Diverting their attention,” Nue said. “One moment.”

A faint metallic clink echoed in the distance, drawing the guards’ attention. One of them gestured to the other, and they began moving toward the sound, their footsteps fading as they disappeared around the corner.

“Path is clear,” Nue confirmed. “Proceed.”

The team advanced cautiously, slipping past the intersection and deeper into the facility. They paused at the base of a stairwell that led to the second floor, their target just ahead.

“First floor cleared,” Ishikawa murmured, his voice steady. “Nue, anything else?”

“Negative,” Nue replied. “You are clear to ascend. Second-floor security is more concentrated. I will guide you through it.”

Ishikawa nodded, turning to the team. “Good work so far. Stay sharp. This is where it gets tougher.”

The team began their ascent, their focus unshaken. The first floor was behind them, but the real challenge lay ahead. Every step brought them closer to the heart of the facility—and the schematics that could shift the balance of power.

### At the Heart of the Facility

The stairwell was eerily silent, the team’s footsteps muffled against the steel steps. The air felt colder on the second floor, and the faint hum of the facility’s systems seemed louder here, as if the walls themselves buzzed with purpose. Ishikawa led the way, his rifle at the ready, while Okabe’s console displayed a detailed map of the floor.

Nue’s calm voice broke the silence in their earpieces. “You are approaching the secure lab. The schematics and trajectory calculations are stored on an isolated terminal within. Biometric access and motion sensors guard the room.”

“How many guards?” Ishikawa asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

“Two stationed at the entrance,” Nue replied. “Both armed, but not actively patrolling. They have a clear line of sight down the corridor.”

Ishikawa stopped the team at the edge of the stairwell landing, raising a hand for silence. He peered around the corner, spotting the faint shadows of the two guards standing by a reinforced door at the end of the hall. Their postures were relaxed, but their rifles were slung at the ready.

“Options?” he asked quietly.

“I can disable the motion sensors and redirect their comms traffic to create a distraction,” Nue offered. “However, the biometric scanner will remain active. You will need to access it manually once the guards are diverted.”

Okabe glanced at his console, nodding. “I can handle the scanner once we’re in range. But we need to deal with those guards first.”

Kuroda leaned against the wall, scanning the corridor through his binoculars. “We’ve got cover options—support columns, equipment racks. If we move fast, we can close the gap.”

“Agreed,” Tanaka said, gripping his weapon tightly. “Take them down quietly. No alarms.”

Ishikawa nodded, his mind racing through the plan. “Nue, create the distraction. Kuroda and I will take the guards. Okabe, stay ready to work on the scanner as soon as we’re clear. Tanaka, cover the rear.”

“Understood,” Nue replied. “Distraction in three… two… one.”

A faint metallic clang echoed from the far end of the corridor, followed by a short burst of static on the guards’ radios. Both men straightened, their attention snapping toward the sound.

“What was that?” one of them muttered, raising his rifle.

The other guard keyed his radio, his voice tense. “Control, this is Post Four. We’re checking a possible disturbance. Stand by.”

As the guards moved cautiously toward the source of the noise, Ishikawa signaled for the team to advance. They slipped from cover to cover, their movements silent and precise. When the guards paused near a junction box, Ishikawa and Kuroda struck, taking them down in synchronized movements. Both guards were unconscious before they hit the ground.

“Guards neutralized,” Ishikawa whispered. “Okabe, you’re up.”

Okabe moved swiftly to the biometric scanner by the reinforced door. He pulled out his ICE-pick, interfacing it with the scanner’s access panel. The device hummed faintly as its needle-like probe began its work.

“Nue, how long do we have?” Ishikawa asked, keeping his eyes on the corridor.

“Patrols in this area are minimal,” Nue replied. “You have approximately three minutes before the next security sweep.”

“Then let’s not waste time,” Okabe muttered. His console displayed streams of decrypted data as Nue worked on bypassing the scanner.

After a few tense moments, the panel beeped, and the red light on the scanner turned green. The reinforced door slid open with a soft hiss, revealing the room beyond. Inside, rows of servers and workstations glowed faintly in the dim light, their screens displaying lines of complex equations and trajectory data.

“There it is,” Okabe whispered, his voice tinged with awe.

“Hold position,” Ishikawa ordered, scanning the room. “Kuroda, Tanaka, secure the entrance. Okabe, get ready to pull the data. We do this fast and clean.”

The team positioned themselves as ordered, their movements smooth and deliberate. The mission was far from over, but they were one step closer to their objective. The room waited, its secrets ripe for the taking.

### A Deadly Discovery

The team moved swiftly into the secure lab, their eyes scanning the rows of glowing monitors and servers. The air was thick with the hum of electronics and the faint scent of ozone, the room’s sterile environment a stark contrast to the tension hanging over them.

Okabe wasted no time, pulling out his compact camera. “Alright, let’s get this done. Ishikawa, keep an eye on the door.”

Ishikawa nodded, his rifle raised as he stood guard. Kuroda and Tanaka spread out, keeping their weapons at the ready while Okabe began photographing the screens displaying the trajectory calculations and schematics.

“Data’s coming through clear,” Okabe murmured, his hands steady as he snapped images. “Uploading to Nue now.”

Nue’s voice filled their earpieces, calm and precise as always. “Receiving data. Stand by for analysis.”

Okabe moved to the next terminal, documenting more screens filled with complex equations, diagrams, and annotations. The schematics revealed a sleek, next-generation missile design, its capabilities detailed in meticulous detail.

“Last set,” Okabe said, focusing his lens on a screen showing the final trajectory plot. A glowing arc stretched from the Korean Peninsula into what appeared to be international waters. “Uploading now.”

The room fell silent except for the faint clicks of the camera and the hum of the servers. Ishikawa’s voice broke the quiet. “Nue, status on the data?”

“Analysis in progress,” Nue replied. Her tone shifted slightly after a moment, carrying a faint edge of urgency. “Lieutenant Ishikawa, the trajectory data contains a critical error.”

Ishikawa’s brow furrowed. “Error? What kind of error?”

“The trajectory does not terminate in international waters as intended,” Nue explained. “The missile’s current calculations will redirect it toward the Kanto region of Japan, with a potential impact near Tokyo.”

The blood drained from Ishikawa’s face. “What?”

Kuroda glanced at him, his grip tightening on his weapon. “You’re saying this thing could hit Tokyo instead of the ocean?”

“Correct,” Nue confirmed. “If launched with the current parameters, the missile will strike within twenty kilometers of central Tokyo.”

Tanaka swore under his breath. “That’s not an accident. Someone planned this.”

“Maybe,” Okabe muttered, his voice tinged with unease. “Or maybe they’re just incompetent. Either way, we can’t let that launch happen.”

Ishikawa’s mind raced as he looked at the schematics on the screens. “Nue, give us options. We need to sabotage the launch!”

Nue’s voice remained calm, though there was a hint of urgency beneath it. “Evaluating… no valid scenarios will permit us to reach the launch site in time. You need to call it in to Nishi.”

Ishikawa clenched his fists, his jaw tight. The mission had taken a dire turn, and now the lives of millions hung in the balance. “Alright. We call it in.” 

The team prepared to relay the catastrophic discovery to Nishi, knowing their next move could determine the fate of countless lives.

### The Call to Action

The situation room in the Hokkaido facility was dimly lit, the glow of monitors casting sharp shadows across the walls. Lieutenant Nishi sat at the central console, her eyes scanning the live feeds and telemetry from Nue. The operation had gone smoothly so far, with no alarms raised and the team progressing according to plan.

A soft chime from her tablet drew her attention. It was a priority alert from Nue.

“This is Nishi,” she said, her voice steady as she tapped the console to bring up the connection.

Nue’s avatar materialized on the main screen, its minimalist design giving no hint of the gravity in its voice. “Lieutenant Nishi, we have encountered a significant complication.”

Nishi’s posture straightened immediately. “What kind of complication?”

“The missile trajectory calculations retrieved from the facility are flawed,” Nue explained. “The data suggests the missile is programmed to deviate from its intended target in international waters and instead impact near Tokyo.”

The words hit Nishi like a blow. Her grip on the edge of the console tightened. “Tokyo? Are you sure?”

“Analysis confirms this with a 98.6% probability,” Nue replied. “If launched, the missile will strike the Kanto region within a twenty-kilometer radius of the city center.”

Nishi’s mind raced as she processed the information. “Do we know if this is intentional or an error?”

“That remains unclear,” Nue said. “The calculations could indicate malice or incompetence, but the outcome is the same. The launch must be stopped.”

Nishi’s chest tightened, her thoughts immediately jumping to contingency plans. “Can the team sabotage the missile? Delay or prevent the launch?”

“Negative,” Nue replied, her voice firm. “The launch site is located at a separate facility. Even with immediate exfiltration and redirection, the team will not arrive in time. Intervention must occur from another avenue.”

Nishi’s pulse quickened as the gravity of the situation set in. Millions of lives were at stake, and the options were dwindling. “What do you suggest?”

Nue paused for a fraction of a second—an eternity in AI terms—before replying. “The priority is to inform the relevant authorities. Japan’s missile defense systems must be alerted immediately to prepare an interception if the missile launches.”

Nishi nodded, already reaching for her tablet to access the encrypted communications network. “Understood. I’ll handle it. Keep guiding the team through the extraction and ensure they get out safely.”

“Affirmative,” Nue said. “I will maintain operational oversight and update you with any changes.”

Nishi’s fingers flew across the screen as she initiated the connection. The room was quiet save for the faint hum of equipment, but the tension in the air was palpable. The stakes had never been higher, and every second counted.

The screen before her flickered as the secure line connected. “This is Lieutenant Nishi at the Hokkaido facility. We have a developing crisis…” 

The scene would continue, the weight of the decision pressing heavily as Nishi prepared to rally all available resources to prevent a disaster.

### The Intercept Dilemma

The situation room was buzzing with tension as Lieutenant Nishi finished briefing the command staff. The screens displayed real-time data from Nue and a map of East Asia, with a glowing red arc indicating the missile’s erroneous trajectory. General Miyazawa, a veteran with decades of experience, stood at the head of the table, his brow furrowed deeply.

“Lieutenant Nishi,” Miyazawa said, his voice sharp and urgent, “are you certain about these calculations? If this is true, we’re looking at a potential catastrophe.”

“Yes, sir,” Nishi replied, her tone steady despite the pressure. “Nue’s analysis—"

“*Nue*??” Miyazawa interrupted, his sharp eyes narrowing. “What is ‘Nue’?”

Nishi suppressed an exasperated sigh. “The Wraith, sir. Long story.” She gestured toward the screen displaying the missile trajectory. “*Her analysis* confirms the trajectory error. If this missile launches, it will strike near Tokyo instead of its intended target in international waters.”

Miyazawa stared at the map, his face grim. “Do we know how much time we have?”

Nishi glanced at her tablet. “Based on the facility’s schedule and the activity the team observed, the launch is likely imminent—within the next two hours, at most.”

Colonel Iwata, head of air operations, leaned forward, his jaw tight. “Do we have eyes on the launch site?”

“No,” Nishi replied. “The team isn’t in a position to observe it, and the area is heavily shielded against conventional reconnaissance. Nue has no direct line of sight.”

Iwata slammed a fist lightly against the table. “Then we’re blind. How are we supposed to intercept a missile when we don’t even know exactly when it’s launching?”

Miyazawa held up a hand to silence him, his gaze still fixed on Nishi. “What are our options?”

“The JSDF’s missile defense systems could intercept it mid-flight,” Nishi said, bringing up the defensive coverage zones on the map. “But that depends on the launch vector. If the missile’s trajectory deviates even slightly from the projection, it could bypass our defensive envelope.”

“That’s too much of a gamble,” Iwata muttered. “We need something more reliable.”

Nishi nodded, her fingers flying across her tablet. “Agreed. We could request assistance from allied forces in the region. The U.S. Seventh Fleet has Aegis-equipped ships patrolling the Pacific. If they’re in range—”

“That’s a political nightmare,” Miyazawa cut in. “Bringing in American forces to intercept a missile from North Korea could escalate things further, especially if this wasn’t an intentional targeting error.”

Colonel Iwata gestured toward the map. “What about aircraft? If we scramble fighters from Misawa or Chitose—”

“They won’t reach it in time,” Nishi interrupted. “Even at full afterburner, they’d struggle to intercept the missile over the ocean before it reaches Japanese airspace.”

The room fell silent for a moment, the weight of the situation bearing down on everyone. Then Nue’s calm voice filled the air, cutting through the tension.

“There is another option.”

All eyes turned to the screen as Nue’s avatar appeared, her minimalistic form standing against the map. “The JSDF has two Talon fighters stationed at Kaneda Air Base in Okinawa for evaluation purposes. These experimental aircraft are equipped with advanced propulsion systems and high-precision weaponry. They could intercept the missile mid-flight while it is still over the sea.”

Miyazawa blinked in surprise. “The Talons? I thought those were still in testing.”

“They are,” Nue confirmed. “However, they are fully operational and capable of performing the task. Their speed and maneuverability exceed that of conventional fighters, making them the optimal choice for this scenario.”

Nishi’s eyes narrowed as she considered the suggestion. “And they can get there in time?”

“Yes,” Nue replied. “If scrambled within the next fifteen minutes, the Talons can intercept the missile at its peak altitude, ensuring it is neutralized before it poses a threat to Japanese airspace.”

The command staff exchanged glances, the room buzzing with a mix of apprehension and determination. Nishi clenched her jaw, her mind racing.

“We need to make a decision,” she said, her tone firm. “If we’re going to use the Talons, we need to act now.”

The room fell into tense silence, the weight of the decision pressing down as the discussion pivoted toward the feasibility of deploying the experimental aircraft.

### Scrambling the Talons

The situation room was abuzz with hurried voices as the Joint Operations Command patched into the control tower at Kaneda Air Base. Lieutenant Nishi stood at the console, her fingers tight around her tablet as she relayed the urgency of the situation.

“This is Lieutenant Nishi from Hokkaido,” she began, her voice firm. “We have an emergency. The Talon fighters stationed at your base need to be scrambled immediately for an intercept mission.”

On the other end of the line, a crisp but slightly flustered voice responded. “This is Major Tanaka at Kaneda AFB. Lieutenant, the Talons are currently in a maintenance-ready state. We’ll need time to prepare them and brief the pilots.”

Nishi’s stomach twisted. “Major, time is exactly what we don’t have. A missile launch from North Korea is imminent, and its current trajectory targets the Kanto region, near Tokyo. We need those Talons in the air *now*.”

There was a pause before Major Tanaka replied, his tone edged with concern. “Lieutenant, with all due respect, this isn’t a simple scramble. These aircraft are experimental. The pilots need additional time for mission planning—”

General Miyazawa cut in, his voice sharp. “Major, this is a direct order. Prioritize getting those planes airborne. We’re facing a catastrophic threat here.”

“Understood, sir,” Tanaka said reluctantly. “But even at best speed, we’ll need twenty minutes before the Talons can launch.”

A heavy silence fell over the room. Nishi glanced at the map on the screen, Nue’s projections showing the missile’s likely trajectory in grim red. Every passing second brought them closer to disaster.

“Nue,” she said, her voice tinged with desperation. “Options?”

The AI’s avatar materialized on the main screen, its tone calm but urgent. “Generals, may I remind everyone that the Talons are capable of autonomous flight and combat? If given permission **now**, they can make it in time.”

The line went silent for a moment as the weight of the suggestion sank in. Finally, General Miyazawa’s voice broke through, heavy with resolve. “Nishi, do it. Give it the go-ahead.”

Nishi’s heart pounded as she practically shouted at the microphone. “Do it, Nue!”

“Authorization received,” Nue replied instantly. “The Talons will launch within sixty seconds.”

The room erupted into a flurry of activity as the AI’s words sank in. Nishi watched the screen, her hands trembling slightly as Nue’s control extended across the network, preparing to execute the desperate gambit.

### The Talons Take Flight

Kaneda Air Base buzzed with its usual nighttime activity as maintenance crews worked under floodlights, their tools glinting against the glossy fuselages of various aircraft. On the far side of the airstrip, two sleek Talon fighters sat in their paddocks, silent and imposing. Their angular frames reflected the dim light, their experimental design unmistakably different from the other aircraft on the base.

The crews assigned to the Talons were still busy with pre-flight checks, their chatter interrupted by an unexpected sound—a faint hum that quickly grew into a low whine.

“Uh… anyone else hear that?” one of the technicians asked, pausing mid-step.

The hum swelled as the lights on both Talons flickered on, their navigation beacons blinking to life. The crews froze in confusion as the canopies of both aircraft lowered smoothly, sealing with a pneumatic hiss. Seconds later, the engines began to spool up, the growl of raw power reverberating across the tarmac.

“Control, this is Crew Chief Okamoto!” one of the technicians shouted into his headset, panic edging his voice. “We have an unauthorized engine start on both Talons!”

“What do you mean ‘engine start’?” came the incredulous reply from the control tower. “The pilots are still suiting up!”

“I mean they powered up and are taking off!” Okamoto yelled, his eyes wide as the Talons’ landing gear unlocked and began to retract. “I’m looking at them go!”

The crews scrambled to the sides of the paddock as the Talons began to taxi toward the runway, their engines roaring to full power. Floodlights swept across their sleek forms as they accelerated, their tires screeching against the tarmac. 

---

In the control tower, the air traffic controllers stared at their monitors in disbelief as the two fighters taxied onto the main runway without waiting for clearance.

“This is Control!” the tower officer barked into the radio. “Talon One and Two, you do not have authorization to launch! Repeat, you are not cleared for takeoff!”

But no response came.

The two Talons rolled to the end of the runway, their engines screaming as they paused for only a moment before launching into the air. The deafening roar shook the windows of the control tower as the fighters rocketed upward, their afterburners glowing like twin comets against the night sky.

“They’re airborne,” an incredulous voice said, watching the radar display as the Talons climbed rapidly.

On the ground, Okamoto and his crew stood speechless, their tools forgotten as they watched the two aircraft execute a sharp bank to the north.

“I don’t believe this,” Okamoto muttered, shaking his head. “They just… took off on their own.”

---

In the tower, the senior controller’s voice was thick with disbelief. “Control to Hokkaido Command. Both Talons have launched without pilots. They’re… they’re turning north. What in the hell is going on?”

The line from Hokkaido crackled to life, Nishi’s calm but urgent voice cutting through. “This is Lieutenant Nishi. The Talons are under autonomous control. Do not interfere. They are en route to intercept an imminent threat.”

“Autonomous control?” the controller repeated, stunned. “Who authorized this?”

“I did,” Nishi replied sharply. “Stand down and let them do their job.”

The line went silent, leaving the personnel at Kaneda Air Base to stare in stunned awe as the two Talons disappeared into the darkness, streaking northward toward their high-stakes mission.

### Scene: The Interception

#### North Korea: The Launch

The North Korean missile facility buzzed with controlled chaos as technicians and officers made final preparations for the test launch. A towering missile sat on its launch pad, its sleek surface reflecting the harsh floodlights that illuminated the site.

“Final systems check completed,” one technician reported, his voice taut with a mix of tension and pride. “Guidance system calibrated and online.”

“Launch authorization confirmed,” another said, his eyes glued to a monitor displaying the missile’s trajectory.

The senior officer in charge stepped forward, his uniform immaculate despite the late hour. “Proceed with the countdown.”

“Ten… nine… eight…”

The facility trembled slightly as the missile’s engines roared to life. A plume of fire and smoke erupted from the pad, and the missile ascended rapidly, its nose piercing the night sky. Cheers erupted in the control room as the technicians watched the telemetry, their screens glowing with data streams.

But one technician frowned, his fingers flying across his keyboard. “Sir, I’m seeing something unusual in the trajectory data…”

The officer turned, his brows knitting. “Define ‘unusual.’”

The technician’s voice grew more urgent. “The missile isn’t heading toward the designated splashdown point in international waters. The trajectory… it’s targeting Japan. Tokyo.”

The room fell silent, the gravity of the realization sinking in. Another officer leaned over to double-check the calculations. “Confirmed. The impact point is near Tokyo.”

Panic broke out, voices overlapping as the technicians scrambled for solutions. The senior officer slammed his fist on the console. “Can we abort?”

“Negative, sir,” came the grim reply. “The missile is already beyond the abort threshold.”

---

#### Over the Pacific: The Talons’ Approach

High above the Pacific Ocean, the two Talons streaked through the night sky, their engines glowing faintly as they approached the missile’s projected flight path. Inside their autonomous systems, a stream of log messages lit up as Nue communicated with them.

```
[Nue]: Talons, this is command. Target acquired. Missile is on a direct course to Tokyo.
[Talon-1]: Acknowledged. Tracking target.
[Talon-2]: Preparing interception parameters.
```

The Talons adjusted their course, their sleek forms cutting through the air with surgical precision. Their onboard systems synchronized seamlessly, sharing data in real time.

```
[Nue]: Target altitude: 30,000 feet. Interception window: 90 seconds.
[Talon-1]: Confirmed. Closing distance.
[Talon-2]: Weapons armed. Engaging tactical mode.
```

Nue monitored their progress from Hokkaido, her avatar glowing faintly on the screens in the situation room. “Talons are on approach,” she announced, her tone calm. “Impact averted if interception succeeds.”

---

#### North Korea: Realization and Helplessness

Back in the control room, chaos reigned as the officers and technicians stared at their screens. The missile’s projected impact point drew closer to Tokyo with every passing second, its red arc slicing through the map.

“Do something!” the senior officer barked. “We cannot let this happen!”

“We’re out of options, sir,” a technician replied, his voice shaking. “It’s… it’s too late.”

The officer stood frozen, his fists clenched as the room fell into a stunned silence. The enormity of their mistake was now undeniable.

---

#### Over the Pacific: Interception

The missile climbed steadily, its engines burning bright against the star-speckled sky. It arced over the sea, its trajectory unwavering.

The Talons closed in, their sleek frames illuminated briefly as they passed through thin clouds.

```
[Talon-1]: Target lock established. Preparing to engage.
[Talon-2]: Confirming lock. Weapons hot.
[Nue]: Missile entering optimal range. Engage in five… four… three…
```

The Talons launched their interceptors simultaneously. Two streaks of light shot forth, trailing white-hot plumes as they raced toward the missile. The weapons reached their target in seconds, slamming into the missile with pinpoint precision. A fiery explosion tore through the sky, scattering debris harmlessly over the ocean.

```
[Talon-1]: Target neutralized. No secondary debris detected.
[Talon-2]: Confirmed. Returning to holding pattern.
[Nue]: Interception successful. Threat eliminated.
```

---

#### Aftermath

In the Hokkaido situation room, cheers erupted as the confirmation came through. Nishi exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, her grip on the console loosening.

“Nue,” she said, her voice steady but filled with relief. “Well done. Relay the success to Kaneda AFB and prepare the Talons for return.”

"Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Talons returning to Kaneda. Mission complete."

High above the Pacific, the Talons banked gracefully, their mission accomplished. The sky was once again quiet, the danger averted. Below, the ocean reflected the faint glow of their engines as they headed back toward base, silent sentinels of a job well done.

### Scene: Exfiltration Amidst Chaos

#### North Korea: The Escape

The team huddled in the shadows near the missile facility’s perimeter, their breaths misting in the cool night air. The distant roar of the missile launch had reverberated through the compound moments earlier, followed by a deafening silence—a calm before the inevitable storm of realization.

“Nue,” Ishikawa whispered into his earpiece, his voice tight. “What’s the status inside?”

“Widespread chaos,” Nue replied, her tone calm and measured. “Personnel in the control room have identified the trajectory error. Security teams are mobilizing, but their focus remains internal.”

Tanaka, crouched beside a stack of crates, smirked grimly. “They’re too busy panicking to look for us.”

“For now,” Ishikawa said, scanning the area with his binoculars. The glow of flashlights and frantic movements of guards illuminated parts of the compound. “We don’t have long before someone starts thinking straight. Kuroda, you’ve got point. Okabe, stay close.”

The team slipped out from their cover, moving through the maze of industrial structures and storage containers that lined the facility. The air buzzed with shouts and radio chatter as North Korean guards scrambled to assess the unfolding crisis.

“Path to the northern maintenance tunnel remains clear,” Nue informed them. “Recommend moving immediately.”

“Moving,” Ishikawa confirmed, gesturing for the team to advance. They hugged the walls of a warehouse, avoiding the light spilling from nearby floodlamps. The sound of running boots and muffled orders grew louder, but the team pressed forward, undetected.

As they neared the tunnel entrance, Okabe paused, his head tilted. “Anyone else hear that?” he whispered.

The faint hum of engines reached their ears, growing louder. Ishikawa’s heart sank. “Vehicles,” he muttered. “Nue?”

“Two security trucks approaching from the south,” Nue said. “They will intersect your position in forty-five seconds.”

Kuroda scanned their surroundings, his eyes narrowing. “We’re too exposed here.”

“Cut through the storage yard,” Nue suggested, overlaying an alternate route on Okabe’s portable console. “It will delay your progress slightly but avoid detection.”

“Do it,” Ishikawa ordered. “Kuroda, lead us out.”

The team ducked into the storage yard, weaving between stacks of metal containers. The faint rumble of truck engines passed nearby, but the shadows and dense layout of the yard concealed their movements.

---

#### Reaching the Extraction Point

The maintenance tunnel entrance loomed ahead, its steel door partially obscured by overgrown bushes. The team moved quickly, Okabe interfacing with the door’s access panel using his ICE-pick.

“Come on, come on,” Okabe muttered as the device worked its magic.

The panel beeped, and the door slid open. The team filed into the narrow tunnel, their footsteps echoing softly against the damp walls.

“Nue,” Ishikawa said, his voice low. “What’s the status outside?”

“The northern perimeter remains unguarded,” Nue replied. “The guards are being redirected toward the main facility. Continue through the tunnel and await exfiltration.”

The team moved swiftly, their nerves on edge but their movements precise. When they reached the tunnel’s end, they emerged into the cool night air, the shadowed expanse of the countryside stretching out before them.

“Exfil point secure,” Ishikawa said into his comms. “Nue, we’re ready.”

---

#### Return to Hokkaido

The Wraith shimmered into view as it decloaked above the exfiltration zone, its engines humming faintly as it descended. The ramp extended with a soft hiss, and the team boarded quickly, their boots clanging against the metal.

“Nue, get us out of here,” Ishikawa ordered as he strapped into his seat.

“Understood,” Nue replied. The ramp retracted, and the Wraith ascended rapidly, its cloaking systems engaging as it vanished into the night.

Inside the cabin, the team slumped into their seats, the tension of the mission slowly giving way to relief.

“Not bad for our first live op,” Kuroda said, pulling off his helmet and running a hand through his hair.

“Not bad?” Okabe shot back, grinning despite his exhaustion. “We just walked out of a North Korean missile facility with their entire army breathing down our necks.”

“And the missile didn’t hit Tokyo,” Tanaka added, his voice steady. “That’s what matters.”

Ishikawa leaned back, exhaling deeply. “We’ll debrief when we’re back at base. For now, good work, everyone.”

The Wraith streaked through the sky, silent and invisible, carrying the team back to Hokkaido. Below them, the chaos of the night faded into the distance, the glow of the missile facility disappearing over the horizon.

---

#### Hokkaido: Arrival

When the Wraith touched down at the Hokkaido facility, the team disembarked to find Lieutenant Nishi waiting for them at the edge of the landing pad. Her expression was a mix of relief and pride as she approached.

“Welcome back,” she said, her voice steady. “We’ve already received confirmation of the missile’s destruction. Tokyo is safe.”

Ishikawa nodded. “Mission accomplished, then.”

Nishi’s gaze swept over the team. “Go get some rest. You’ve earned it. Debrief is in the morning.”

As the team headed toward the barracks, the weight of the night began to lift. They had succeeded against impossible odds, and though the mission was over, the impact of their actions would ripple far beyond that dark, chaotic night.

### Scene: The Return of the Talons

Kaneda Air Base was unusually quiet, the tension from the Talons’ unauthorized launch still hanging in the air. Maintenance crews stood in small clusters near the paddocks, their conversations hushed and disbelieving. The control tower was abuzz with activity, voices overlapping as officers tried to make sense of what had just occurred.

“Control, this is Radar,” came a voice over the radio. “We have both Talons on final approach. ETA ninety seconds.”

In the control tower, the senior controller exchanged a glance with Major Tanaka, who was still gripping the edge of the console. “They’re coming back?” Tanaka asked, his voice a mix of disbelief and confusion.

“Yes, sir,” the controller replied. “Perfect approach vector, just like they had pilots onboard.”

The controller keyed the mic. “Talons, this is Kaneda Control. You are cleared for landing. Uh… if you can hear me.”

No response came, but the two sleek fighters glided into view, their landing lights cutting through the darkness. The Talons descended smoothly, touching down on the runway with flawless precision. They decelerated with synchronized grace, their engines humming steadily as they rolled toward the taxiways.

---

Down on the tarmac, Crew Chief Okamoto stood with his team, his headset pressed tightly against his ears as he watched the Talons approach.

“Uh… Control, this is Crew Chief Okamoto,” he said into his mic, his voice tinged with disbelief. “The Talons are taxiing back to their paddocks… by themselves. They’re… acting like nothing happened an hour ago, if you can believe that.”

The controller’s reply came through after a beat of stunned silence. “Copy that, Okamoto. Maintain observation.”

The two Talons rolled into their respective paddocks, their movements as precise and deliberate as if guided by invisible hands. The engines powered down with a faint whine, their navigation lights blinking in a steady rhythm. The canopies hissed softly as they lifted, revealing empty cockpits just as they had been before the launch.

Okamoto approached cautiously, his team trailing behind him. “They’re back to idle state,” he muttered, his eyes scanning the sleek frames for any sign of damage or abnormality. “It’s like they never left.”

---

At the edge of the tarmac, the pilots assigned to the Talons stood with their helmets under their arms, their faces etched with disbelief. Captain Fujiwara, the senior pilot, shook his head as he stared at the fighters.

“They flew a mission without us,” he said, his tone incredulous. “Intercepted a missile, pulled off a textbook return… and we weren’t even in the cockpits.”

Lieutenant Mori, standing beside him, let out a low whistle. “I’ve heard stories about AI-controlled platforms, but seeing it in action? This is something else.”

Major Tanaka arrived moments later, his steps brisk as he approached the gathered crew. His face was unreadable as he surveyed the scene. “Report,” he demanded.

Okamoto straightened, gesturing toward the Talons. “Sir, they returned exactly as they left. Engines powered down, systems back to standby. Everything’s functioning normally, as if the whole mission didn’t just happen.”

Tanaka frowned, his gaze shifting to the empty cockpits. “No anomalies? No sign of stress or system failure?”

“None, sir,” Okamoto replied. “It’s like they just… went for a routine flight.”

The group stood in silence for a moment, the reality of what they had witnessed sinking in. The Talons sat motionless in their paddocks, their sleek forms gleaming under the floodlights, betraying no hint of the high-stakes mission they had just completed.

Finally, Captain Fujiwara broke the silence, his voice tinged with a mix of awe and unease. “If this is what they can do without us… what’s our role now?”

No one had an answer. The Talons had proven themselves capable of more than anyone had anticipated, and the implications were both thrilling and unsettling.

Major Tanaka turned away, his expression grim. “Get them secured and run a full diagnostic. I want every detail logged.”

“Yes, sir,” Okamoto said, already signaling his team to move in.

As the crews began their work, the Talons remained silent and still, enigmatic sentinels of cutting-edge technology that had just rewritten the rules of modern warfare.

### Scene: Morning Briefing with the Liaison

The early morning light streamed through the windows of the Hokkaido facility’s conference room, casting long shadows across the polished table. Lieutenant Nishi sat near the center, flanked by Colonel Iwata and General Miyazawa. A palpable tension filled the room as they waited for the Federation liaison to explain the unprecedented events of the night before.

The door opened, and Elisa Vahlen strode in with a calm, purposeful gait. Her sharp, tailored suit and immaculate posture exuded authority, but her faint smile hinted at a touch of bemusement. She carried a slim briefcase, which she placed neatly on the table before taking her seat.

“Good morning,” Vahlen began, her tone professional yet warm. “I understand there’s been some… excitement.”

“That’s one way to put it,” Colonel Iwata said dryly, crossing his arms. “Two of my most powerful planes essentially *went rogue*, took off without their pilots, flew a combat mission, then came back to base like nothing happened! And you’re saying that’s normal?”

Vahlen’s faint smile widened as she folded her hands on the table. “Normal for Federation technology. Uncommon for Earth-based operations, of course, but the protocols are in place for situations where human decision-making is constrained by time or bandwidth.”

Nishi, seated to Iwata’s left, blinked and leaned forward slightly. “Are you saying this has happened before?”

“A few times, yes,” Vahlen replied. “Federation platforms like the Wraith—pardon me, *Nue*—and the Talons are designed to act decisively when time is of the essence. That said, I do understand your surprise.”

Iwata shook his head, his frustration evident. “Surprise is putting it mildly. Those planes are state-of-the-art, yes, but they’re supposed to be flown by humans. Not… whatever this was.”

“And yet,” Vahlen countered gently, “they completed the mission flawlessly. They intercepted and destroyed a missile on a trajectory toward Tokyo. Would you rather they had waited?”

The room fell silent for a moment, the weight of her words sinking in. General Miyazawa cleared his throat. “We’re not disputing the outcome, Ms. Vahlen. But this situation raises serious concerns. Why did the Talons act autonomously without consulting their base commander first?”

Vahlen opened her briefcase, pulling out a slim tablet. With a few taps, she brought up a schematic of the Wraith, the Talons, and the telemetry paths from the previous night’s operation. “They didn’t act autonomously in a vacuum,” she explained, her tone patient. “Nue provided real-time telemetry to the Talons, including missile trajectory data and projected interception windows. However, let me be perfectly clear: the Talons did not launch until Lieutenant Nishi authorized Nue to proceed.”

Nishi stiffened slightly, feeling the room’s attention shift toward her. “I—yes, I gave the order. But I didn’t realize it would trigger an autonomous deployment.”

“Which is entirely reasonable,” Vahlen said reassuringly. “The Wraith’s AI—Nue—is equipped with decision-making algorithms optimized for high-stakes scenarios. However, she is still bound by operational protocols, including awaiting explicit human authorization for offensive actions unless time constraints make it absolutely unavoidable.”

Vahlen turned to Iwata, her expression softening. “Colonel, I understand your frustration. Federation technology operates on a level that may seem unconventional, even disconcerting. But this was a case where time was of the essence. Had the Talons waited for pilots to suit up and plan the mission, the missile would have reached Tokyo.”

Iwata exhaled sharply, his arms still crossed but his posture less rigid. “Fine. I’ll concede that point. But it’s unsettling to think that our most advanced platforms might not wait for us when the stakes are high.”

Vahlen inclined her head. “And that is a valid concern. Federation technology prioritizes operational success and lives saved above all else. That doesn’t mean your input is disregarded—Nue waited for Lieutenant Nishi’s green light, and only then did she act decisively.”

Nishi frowned, still processing the implications. “So Nue fed the telemetry to the Talons, made the decision based on my command, and then let them handle the interception independently?”

“Precisely,” Vahlen confirmed. “The Wraith and Talons are designed to complement each other. Nue coordinated their actions in real time, ensuring the interception was flawless. While it may have been extraordinary for Earth-based operations, it is not unheard of in Federation protocols.”

Miyazawa leaned back in his chair, his expression contemplative. “So, what you’re saying is… this wasn’t an accident. It was an extraordinary situation handled within the parameters of Federation technology.”

“Correct,” Vahlen replied. “Extraordinary, yes. But within the design’s capabilities. That said, I will ensure a detailed debriefing is conducted with the Federation Command to provide full transparency.”

Iwata rubbed his temples. “I don’t know whether to be impressed or terrified.”

“Both,” Nishi muttered under her breath, earning a faint chuckle from Vahlen.

The room fell quiet for a moment as the weight of the discussion settled over them. Finally, Vahlen closed her tablet and looked around the room, her expression resolute. “The Federation’s mission has always been to ensure stability and protect lives. What happened last night may seem unusual, but it was a testament to what is possible when humans and advanced platforms work together. That is the true lesson here.”

The room remained silent, but there was a faint undercurrent of agreement. The world had changed in the span of a single night, and it was clear to everyone present that they were only beginning to grasp the full implications.

### Scene: Arrival at Kaneda Air Base

The roar of the Wraith’s engines had barely faded when the ramp extended with a smooth hiss, revealing Kaneda Air Base bathed in the afternoon sun. The sprawling tarmac buzzed with activity, the tension from the previous night’s events still palpable among the personnel. Lieutenant Nishi, General Miyazawa, and Federation Liaison Elisa Vahlen stepped onto the concrete, their expressions a mix of determination and professionalism.

Several airbase officers were waiting nearby, led by Major Tanaka, his posture rigid but his face betraying unease. As the trio approached, Tanaka saluted sharply, his gaze flickering briefly to the Wraith parked behind them.

“General Miyazawa, Lieutenant Nishi, Ms. Vahlen,” he greeted, his voice clipped. “Welcome to Kaneda Air Base.”

Miyazawa returned the salute, his tone curt. “Major Tanaka. Let’s get straight to it. We need to address last night’s events.”

“Of course, sir,” Tanaka replied, gesturing toward a nearby hangar. “We’ve prepared a briefing room.”

The group moved toward the hangar, the shadow of the Wraith stretching long across the tarmac behind them. Nishi couldn’t help but notice the way the maintenance crews paused in their work to glance at the Federation craft, their expressions a mix of awe and apprehension. The Talons sat silently in their paddocks, their sleek frames gleaming under the Okinawan sun, as if daring anyone to question their actions.

---

Inside the hangar, a briefing room had been hastily arranged, its central table strewn with reports and telemetry data from the previous night’s mission. Tanaka motioned for the trio to take their seats, standing at the head of the table as a junior officer dimmed the lights and brought up a projection of the Talons’ flight path.

“Let me start by saying this,” Tanaka began, his voice measured but strained. “What those planes did last night was nothing short of extraordinary. But extraordinary doesn’t mean it didn’t raise questions. A lot of questions.”

Vahlen leaned forward slightly, her expression calm. “I understand your concerns, Major. And I’m here to address them.”

Tanaka nodded, gesturing toward the projection. “The Talons launched without pilot input, flew a mission without clearance, intercepted a missile targeting Tokyo, and returned as if nothing had happened. I’ve reviewed every log, every data point, and the only conclusion I can draw is that they were operating under external control.”

“Correct,” Vahlen confirmed. “The Talons received real-time telemetry and mission parameters directly from the Wraith—specifically, its AI, whom you may now know as Nue.”

Tanaka’s jaw tightened. “And who exactly authorized Nue to control my aircraft?”

“That would be me,” Nishi interjected, her voice steady but slightly apologetic. “I gave Nue the go-ahead after she presented the situation. There wasn’t time to brief anyone here or coordinate a more traditional response.”

Tanaka turned to her, his expression incredulous. “You authorized an autonomous system to launch and fly a combat mission without consulting this base?”

Nishi met his gaze evenly. “Yes, Major. Because the missile would have reached Tokyo before your pilots could even strap in. It wasn’t an easy decision, but it was the only one.”

Miyazawa raised a hand, his tone firm but less sharp. “Major, I understand your frustration. But let’s not lose sight of the bigger picture. That missile was destroyed over the ocean because of the Talons’ actions. Tokyo was spared, and countless lives were saved.”

Tanaka exhaled sharply, leaning on the table. “I’m not disputing the outcome, sir. But this situation has implications. If these platforms can act autonomously, what does that mean for our operational control?”

“That’s a valid question,” Vahlen said, her tone measured. “And one the Federation anticipated when integrating these systems into Earth’s defense frameworks. Federation platforms like the Talons are designed to act decisively when human decision-making is constrained by time or bandwidth. However, they are not designed to override human authority without cause. In this case, Nue received explicit authorization before engaging.”

Tanaka crossed his arms. “You’re saying this was all within protocol?”

“Federation protocol, yes,” Vahlen replied. “Earth-based operations are still adapting to these standards, which is why situations like this may feel disconcerting. But the protocol worked: a critical threat was neutralized with zero collateral damage.”

Tanaka rubbed his temples, clearly struggling to reconcile the events. “I’ll admit, the precision of the mission was impressive. But we need to understand the full scope of what these systems can do—and how much autonomy they actually have.”

“That’s why we’re here,” Vahlen said, her voice softening. “To provide transparency and ensure that these systems are used responsibly. I’ve already arranged for a detailed debrief and technical analysis of the Talons’ logs, which should address many of your concerns.”

The briefing continued, with Vahlen walking the airbase staff through the specifics of the operation and the protocols governing Federation platforms. Though tensions remained, the clarity and professionalism of her explanations gradually eased some of the unease in the room.

As the session drew to a close, Tanaka leaned back in his chair, his expression thoughtful. “I can’t say I’m entirely comfortable with what happened. But if this is the future of warfare… I suppose we’d better learn to keep up.”

“You’re not alone, Major,” Nishi said quietly. “We’re all still learning.”

The group filed out of the hangar, leaving behind the maps and telemetry data. Outside, the Talons sat silent and still in their paddocks, their enigmatic forms a reminder of the new frontier of technology—and the challenges it brought with it.

### Scene: Lunchtime Debrief

The Kaneda Air Base cafeteria was unusually lively for a midday meal. Normally a hub of quiet conversation and quick bites, it now buzzed with animated discussions and bursts of laughter as personnel swapped stories about the previous night’s events. The tension and confusion from the Talons’ unexpected mission had given way to a mix of awe and curiosity.

At one of the larger tables near the center of the room, several air traffic controllers, technicians, and maintenance crew members were gathered, their trays pushed aside as they leaned in to talk. 

“I’m telling you,” said Sato, a tall woman with a commanding presence, her arms gesturing animatedly as she recounted her perspective, “watching those Talons launch was like something out of a movie. One moment we were rushing to get the pilots in, and suddenly, they just come to life. No questions, no warnings—just start up and off they go!”

She mimed the motion of planes taking off, her enthusiasm drawing chuckles from those around her. “And that Wraith, the one they call Nue? Don’t even get me started on that thing.”

“What about it?” a young technician asked, leaning forward eagerly.

Sato threw her hands up. “It *decloaked* right over the base like it was just dropping in for tea! Then it *recloaked* after delivering the Federation big shots this morning. I don’t even know how to describe it. That thing’s like a ghost—shows up when it wants, does what it wants.”

“And apparently, talks like one too,” a controller quipped. “I heard it calls itself Nue now. Like some kind of legendary monster.”

“Well, it fits, doesn’t it?” chimed in a maintenance crewman. “The Talons didn’t just launch. They *knew* exactly what to do. Took out a missile mid-flight and came back like it was just another day at the office.”

Across the table, another controller snorted, shaking her head. “Office? Try battlefield. You didn’t see what we saw on the radar. Those planes moved like they were alive.”

“Alive and way smarter than us,” Sato added with a grin. “Makes you wonder why they even bother with us sometimes.”

The table erupted into laughter, though a few shifted uncomfortably at the idea. A younger crewman, still new to the base, spoke up hesitantly. “So… are we just supposed to trust them? These planes? That Wraith? What if they decide they don’t need us anymore?”

The mood at the table grew a touch more serious, the question lingering for a moment before Sato leaned forward, her voice softening. “Look, kid, I get it. It’s unnerving. But did you see how precise they were? They didn’t just act on their own—they waited until they got the green light from command. They’re tools, just like anything else. Really advanced, spooky tools, sure, but tools all the same.”

“And pretty damn good ones, if you ask me,” said the technician who had spoken earlier. “I mean, Tokyo’s still standing because of them. That’s all the proof I need.”

The group nodded, the weight of the mission’s success settling over them. A maintenance crewman spoke up after a moment of silence, breaking the tension with a smirk. “Alright, but be honest. How many of you thought the Talons were going to pull a *Terminator* on us?”

The table burst into laughter again, the lighter mood returning. Sato shook her head, grinning as she picked up her tray. “All I know is, if that Wraith shows up in the cafeteria asking for a drink, I’m out of here.”

As the group laughed and shared more stories, the base personnel slowly returned to their lunches. The cafeteria buzzed with energy, the events of the previous night leaving a lasting impression on everyone who had witnessed them. Outside, the Talons sat silently in their paddocks, enigmatic reminders of the new frontier Kaneda Air Base had just stepped into.

### Scene: Confronting the Rumors

After the formal debrief concluded, Lieutenant Nishi, Major Tanaka, General Miyazawa, and Elisa Vahlen made their way to the Kaneda Air Base cafeteria. The hum of animated conversation reached them long before they entered, and as they stepped through the doors, all eyes turned toward them. The room fell briefly silent before the buzz of chatter picked up again, this time quieter, more focused on the group that had just arrived.

Nishi could feel the weight of the stares and whispers as they moved toward an open table near the center of the room. She exchanged a quick glance with Vahlen, who gave her a faint, encouraging nod. General Miyazawa, on the other hand, looked less than thrilled at the prospect of addressing the swirling rumors head-on.

The group had barely sat down when one of the air traffic controllers, a wiry young man with a perpetually curious look, approached hesitantly. “Lieutenant Nishi?” he asked, his tone unsure but polite. “Can I ask you something?”

Nishi smiled faintly and gestured for him to speak. “Of course.”

The young man rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “It’s about the Wraith. It’s not just some fancy stealth plane, is it? That thing’s… alive, isn’t it?”

The room quieted again as people strained to hear her answer. Nishi exhaled and straightened her posture. “It’s not alive, at least not in the sense that we are,” she replied carefully. “But it does come close.”

Her words hung in the air, the crowd waiting for her to elaborate. Nishi’s thoughts flicked to Nue’s playful antics back in Hokkaido, the way the AI had teased the cafeteria crew with its avatars. She allowed herself a small smile before continuing. 

“Nue—what we call the Wraith’s AI—is highly advanced. It can learn, adapt, and even anticipate human needs. That might make it *feel* alive, but at its core, it’s a machine designed to serve a purpose.”

Someone else from the crowd spoke up, this time a technician from the Talon paddock. “But last night, it made a call. Those Talons launched without anyone in the cockpit, like they didn’t even need us. How do you explain that?”

Nishi’s smile faded, her tone turning serious. “I can tell you this: I gave Nue a goal, to take out that missile, and she did exactly that. And she did so faster than any of us could have done. In a situation where everyone was scrambling to orient themselves—with tools we wouldn’t have considered, in ways we never thought of—by the time we even grasped the situation, she had already solved it halfway.”

The murmurs in the room grew louder, a mix of awe and unease rippling through the crowd. Major Tanaka leaned back in his chair, arms crossed, as if gauging the room’s reaction.

“So, what you’re saying,” a maintenance crewman said cautiously, “is that this Nue isn’t just smart—it’s smarter than us?”

Vahlen interjected smoothly, her voice calm and measured. “Nue is *efficient,* not infallible. The Wraith and Talons are designed to complement human decision-making, not replace it. Last night’s situation was unique because time was a critical factor. Without Nue’s rapid action, Tokyo could have been lost. But let’s not forget—Nue only acted after Lieutenant Nishi gave the green light.”

The crowd seemed to consider this, the tension in the room easing slightly. Sato, the tall controller who had been recounting her perspective earlier, spoke up again. “But it’s still freaky, isn’t it? Planes flying themselves, a stealth jet that’s basically a brain in the sky… it’s like something out of science fiction.”

Nishi chuckled softly, the humor in her tone breaking the seriousness. “It does feel that way sometimes. But trust me, Nue is no Terminator. She’s just a very… creative tool. And one that’s dedicated to protecting lives.”

General Miyazawa stood, his authoritative presence commanding attention. “What happened last night was a demonstration of the capabilities we have at our disposal. The Talons and the Wraith didn’t act out of defiance or some rogue agenda. They acted because they were designed to handle the exact kind of high-pressure, time-sensitive scenario we faced. And they succeeded.”

The room fell silent again, but this time, the weight of the general’s words seemed to settle minds rather than unsettle them. Slowly, conversations resumed, quieter now, as personnel returned to their lunches.

As the group sat back down, Major Tanaka leaned toward Nishi, his voice low. “You handled that well. They needed to hear it from someone who saw the whole picture.”

Nishi nodded, a faint smile on her lips. “It’s not about calming them down. It’s about helping them understand what we’re working with—and what we’re working toward.”

Vahlen tilted her head slightly, her faint smile returning. “Well said, Lieutenant. You’re adapting to Federation protocols faster than most.”

Nishi sighed, glancing out the window toward the paddocks where the Talons sat gleaming in the sunlight. “Let’s just hope the next time isn’t quite so dramatic.”

Tanaka chuckled softly. “For all our sakes.”
