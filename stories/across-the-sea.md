## Chapter 1: Encroachment

### Taiwan Strait, 0321 hours local

*Chinese Type 055 destroyer Haiyangshan*

Sea fog clung low to the waterline, glowing faintly under the ship's forward floodlights. The *Haiyangshan* surged westward through the waves, undeterred by the Taiwanese Coast Guard's increasingly desperate hails.

> "Unidentified military vessel, you are in violation of Republic of China territorial waters. Turn back immediately or you will be intercepted."

Captain Lu Jianjun stood with his hands clasped behind his back, watching the signal repeater screens with studied indifference. Twenty-four years in the navy had taught him to distinguish between genuine threats and theatrical posturing. This was the latter.

> "Let them bark," he said quietly. "We've run this route weekly. They know the pattern by now."

> "New intercept attempt, sir," reported the radar officer. "Two fast-attack boats, changing bearing - trying to box us in from the south."

Lu allowed himself a thin smile. Bold of them, certainly. But boldness without strength was merely noise.

"Maintain course and broadcast civil traffic intent," he ordered. "File it under hydrographic survey operations."

"Aye, sir."

The bridge settled into routine. Outside, the water churned under the destroyer's steady advance, its radar signature flickering subtly - artificially softened, but still plainly visible to Taiwanese tracking systems. A deliberate message: *We're here. We're not hiding.*

Lu had been making these runs for eight months now, each one probing a little deeper, staying a little longer. Testing responses. Measuring resolve. The Americans watched from a distance, the Japanese filed their protests, and Taipei grew increasingly shrill in its objections.

All according to plan.

But lately, something had begun to gnaw at him. Not doubt - never doubt - but a growing sense that time was running short. The political winds in Beijing were shifting. Too many voices now counseled restraint, accommodation, *patience*. As if patience had ever won wars or secured borders.

Through the upper observation window, the glow of the distant shoreline began to take shape - Taiwan's western edge, faint but unmistakable in the predawn haze. Soon, Lu knew, those lights would be Chinese lights. The only question was whether it would happen through strength or through the slow erosion of will that seemed to infect so many of his superiors.

A young lookout scanned the shore through his telescope, pausing to rub condensation from the eyepiece. He swept slowly across the horizon: industrial sprawl, patchy farmland, the usual silhouettes of grain silos and transmission towers. He almost skipped over the low dune clusters - until something geometric caught his eye.

He adjusted the focus. There - on the beach. Not structures. Not natural rock formations, either.

He blinked. Shapes. Standing still. Too symmetrical. Too *deliberate*.

> "Uh - sir?" His voice cracked slightly as he stepped back from the scope.

Lu turned, brows raised in mild curiosity.

> "What is it?"

> "I think... I think there's something on the shore. Unknown objects. Right at the treeline."

The bridge fell quiet for a beat. Lu's expression didn't change, but something cold settled in his stomach - an old instinct from decades at sea.

> "Unknown how?"

> "Just... not ours. And not theirs."

Lu stepped forward with deliberate calm, gesturing for the lookout to make room.

> "Show me."

---

### Western Coastline, Yunlin County

The scope's image swam into focus, and Lu's world shifted.

Four figures stood motionless among the dunes, their forms angular and inhuman. Even at this distance, their geometry was wrong - too tall, too rigid, proportioned like machines rather than men. They weren't moving, weren't gesturing, weren't doing anything at all.

They were simply *there*. Watching.

Lu adjusted the focus ring with steady fingers, though his pulse had begun to quicken. One of the figures seemed to be carrying something - a long weapon mounted across its back. Another had what looked like oversized arms, mechanical joints visible even through the morning haze.

These weren't soldiers. They weren't even *human*.

> "Sir?" the lookout asked quietly.

Lu didn't answer immediately. He was thinking of briefings he'd attended in Beijing, classified reports that had filtered down through intelligence channels. Incidents in Gaza. Unexplained encounters in the South China Sea. Video footage that analysts claimed was fabricated, though it had looked disturbingly real.

*Landmates*, they called them. Autonomous weapons of unknown origin. The Americans denied knowledge. The Russians stayed silent. No one claimed them, yet they appeared wherever tensions threatened to boil over into actual conflict.

> "Continue scanning," Lu said finally, his voice betraying nothing. "Document everything you see."

But even as he spoke, Lu felt something fundamental shift inside him. This wasn't a Taiwanese defensive position. This wasn't an American forward deployment. This was something else entirely - something that made the careful balance of power in the Strait suddenly irrelevant.

For eight months, he'd been playing a game where he understood the rules. Now, watching those silent sentinels on the beach, he realized the game had changed.

And no one had bothered to tell him.

---

### *Haiyangshan*, Forward Observation Deck

> "Sir?" the lookout repeated, his voice tight with barely controlled tension.

He didn't wait for Lu to reach the telescope. Instead, he pressed his eye back against the eyepiece, fingers fumbling the focus ring with rising urgency.

The shoreline swam into clarity again. His heart hammered against his ribs.

They were still there.

Three... no, four figures. Tall. Rigid. Too rigid. Armor-plated, matte and angular, like exosuits designed by someone who had never seen a human being. One was stepping forward now, slow and methodical, like a machine calculating the optimal placement of each footfall.

Then the largest one moved.

He watched in stunned silence as the unit dropped one knee into the sand. Its arms extended - not in defense, but with unmistakable intent. A long weapon mounted to its back swung forward with fluid precision and locked into firing position over the shoulder.

He followed the line of the barrel.

It pointed straight at the bridge.

His mouth went dry.

> "Captain - " he said, louder now. "Captain, you need to see this."

Lu crossed the deck with measured steps, his face a mask of professional calm. But the lookout caught the slight tension in his shoulders, the way his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

> "What is it now?" Lu asked, though his tone suggested he already suspected.

The lookout stepped aside without a word. He didn't trust himself to speak. He just pointed.

Lu peered through the scope.

The silence that followed stretched like a taut wire.

> "...What in God's name is that?"

Onshore, the crouched unit remained perfectly still, weapon braced and barrel steady - unmoving, unblinking. Just behind it, another figure shifted its stance. Its faceplate turned directly toward the destroyer.

Then, with surreal calm, it raised one hand.

And waved.

Lu straightened slowly, ice forming in his veins. The lookout finally found his voice.

> "Sir, I -  I've seen those before. That model."

Lu turned sharply. "Where?"

> "Gaza. Last month. Video came out - was online for less than an hour before it disappeared. IDF Merkava put a shell directly into one at twenty meters. Didn't even scratch it."

> "You're certain?"

> "It *killed the tank* with one shot."

The words hung in the air like an indictment. Lu's eyes flicked back toward the shoreline, where the impossible figures continued their silent vigil.

For twenty-four years, Lu had served his country with distinction. He had risen through the ranks by understanding power - how to project it, how to recognize it, how to use it. He had learned to read the subtle language of naval engagement, the careful dance of deterrence and display that kept conflicts from boiling over into catastrophe.

But this? This was something beyond the familiar choreography of geopolitics. This was power he didn't recognize, couldn't categorize, couldn't counter with anything in his arsenal.

And it was *watching him*.

> "Bridge, alert condition two," Lu said, his voice low but sharp. "Get me eyes on the beach, right now. And prepare to reverse course."

No reply came at first. Just the faint whine of radar sweep spinning faster.

The lookout swallowed hard, his eyes fixed on the shore.

> "Sir... they're not bluffing."

Lu knew he was right. Whatever those things were, wherever they had come from, they weren't posturing. They were *waiting*. For what, he couldn't say.

But as he watched that mechanical figure continue its slow, deliberate wave, Lu felt the first crack appear in his certainty about China's destiny in the Strait.

The game had rules, yes.

But someone had just changed them.

---

### *Haiyangshan*, Combat Information Center

Lu snapped the intercom switch with slightly more force than necessary.

> "Helm, come to course 1-7-5. Maintain distance from the shore."

> "Aye sir, 1-7-5 holding steady."

The ship responded within moments, hull groaning softly as the rudder bit seawater and veered the destroyer southward - parallel to the Taiwanese coastline, putting distance between the ship and whatever was waiting onshore.

Lu turned to the communications officer, his voice carrying the weight of command.

> "Raise Fleet Command. Priority channel. I want full video uplink of those units sent *now*. Label them `HARBINGER`-type. Make sure they understand that designation."

> "Yes, sir. Transmitting package."

The bridge was tense now, hands working with increased urgency. No alarms had sounded, but every man aboard could feel the shift in atmosphere. Something had crossed a line - *something real*.

The lookout hadn't moved from his position. His knuckles were white around the scope's grips.

> "Still watching us," he reported quietly.

Lu walked back over, keeping his expression neutral. "What do you mean?"

> "The one with the cannon. It's tracking."

The telescope's focus swept slightly as the destroyer altered course - but the weapon's barrel on the shore mirrored every motion, panning smoothly, never wavering from its mark.

Not threatening. Not firing. Just... *tracking*.

> "Still on the bridge," the lookout added, barely above a whisper.

The thing didn't blink. Didn't twitch. Just held that gaze, that impossible, machine-dead stare that somehow conveyed more menace than any human sniper ever could.

Lu felt something cold settle beneath his sternum. Not fear - he'd faced fear before. This was something else. *Recognition*. The understanding that he was looking at a predator so far beyond his capabilities that resistance would be not just futile, but *irrelevant*.

> "No heat signature?"

> "Minimal. Too clean. Like it's being *bled off* somehow."

The communications officer turned, his face pale.

> "Sir. Command confirms `HARBINGER` match. Multiple sightings - Middle East, Southeast Asia. No confirmed origin. Just that designation, and..." He hesitated.

> "And what?"

> "And that voice, sir. The synthetic one. Always the same message: *'We are watching.'*"

Lu nodded grimly. Everyone in the fleet had heard the recordings by now. That calm, artificial voice introducing itself as `HARBINGER`. The machine that had walked through fire, through gunfire, through *tanks* - and ended fights in seconds.

No flag. No emblem. Just presence. And judgment.

> "So they've made it here too," Lu said quietly.

But even as he spoke, a darker thought was taking shape. If these... *things*... could appear anywhere, engage anything, defeat anyone - what did that mean for China's ambitions? What did it mean for the careful plans that had taken years to develop?

What did it mean for commanders like him, who had built their careers on the assumption that power still mattered in the traditional sense?

Outside, the *Haiyangshan* rolled gently southward, riding the current away from the quiet menace on the shore. But in the scope, the Landmate's gun still tracked them, unwavering, like a sniper's eye that never closed.

*Watching.*

And Lu began to understand that watching might be all it ever needed to do.

---

### *Haiyangshan*, Bridge

The hum of electronics and filtered air filled the silence that had settled over the bridge like fog. Lu stood at the forward viewing port, staring through the armored glass at the distant shoreline. It looked the same as it had an hour ago - unchanged, unremarkable.

But he knew it wasn't. Not anymore.

> "Helm. Come to course 0-4-5. Return to base. Full discretion."

> "Aye sir. Coming to 0-4-5. Returning to port."

The deck shifted underfoot as the *Haiyangshan* banked to starboard, its bow angling northeast toward home waters. Lu didn't need to make it look like anything other than what it was - a strategic withdrawal in the face of an unknown threat.

On the observation deck, the lookout remained glued to his scope, breath held. Then - 

> "Sir... they're moving."

Lu didn't respond immediately. He stepped beside the sailor and looked through the telescope himself, though part of him dreaded what he might see.

The Landmate with the long weapon was rising - fluid, precise, powered limbs pulling it upright in a single smooth motion. The cannon folded back onto its spine with practiced elegance, locking into transport position with mechanical finality.

The others mirrored the movement with eerie synchronicity. One after another, the machines straightened, forming a clean line parallel to the surf. Then, in perfect unison, they snapped into rigid salutes. Arms raised across chests, forearms vertical, palms flat.

They were saluting.

At the destroyer. At *him*.

A farewell.

Lu's stomach turned with the surreal weight of the gesture. These weren't just autonomous weapons. They *knew* what they were doing. They understood the meaning of their actions, the symbolism of respect between warriors.

But more than that - they were showing *restraint*. Discipline. The kind of controlled professionalism that Lu had spent his career trying to instill in his own crews.

The lookout's voice broke the silence.

> "I've never seen machines do that. Not without orders."

Lu exhaled slowly, eyes still fixed on the figures in the distance. The sea churned quietly below as the *Haiyangshan* pushed further out, engines humming at cruising speed.

> "Neither have I."

He turned from the scope at last, his expression carefully neutral. But inside, something fundamental had shifted. The certainty that had carried him through two decades of service - the absolute conviction that Chinese naval power was ascendant, that Taiwan's reunification was inevitable, that *he* was on the right side of history - had developed its first hairline crack.

> "Log everything. Mark the encounter as contact with *Landmate-class `HARBINGER` units*. I want it in Beijing before we're halfway home."

> "Yes, sir."

Behind them, the machines remained at attention - a row of silent, saluting watchers beneath the early morning sky.

No message. No threat. No ultimatum.

Just the unmistakable implication:

*We see you. We know what you're thinking. And we choose to let you go.*

This time.

As the *Haiyangshan* steamed toward home, Lu found himself thinking not about the encounter itself, but about its implications. Somewhere, somehow, a force had emerged that could render his ship - his *career*, his entire service to his country - meaningless with a gesture.

And the most disturbing part wasn't their capability.

It was their *patience*.

Because patient enemies, Lu knew, were the most dangerous kind. They could afford to wait, to watch, to let their opponents make the first - and final - mistake.

The question that would haunt him all the way back to port was simple:

*How long would they keep waiting?*

### U.S. Pacific Command Intelligence Annex, Okinawa

*0823 JST*

Director Cole Whitaker sipped lukewarm coffee from a chipped ceramic mug as the morning intel stack auto-scrolled across the embedded display in his desk. Most of it was noise - commercial satellite captures of DPRK rail movements, overflagged chatter from Philippine VHF marine bands, the usual fishing-boat grumbling in the South China Sea.

Then his eyes stopped on a regional radar summary tagged *PERSIMMON-RAVEN / PRIORITY TWO*.

> **Subject: PLAN Haiyangshan - Incursion Track and Behavior Analysis**
> **Timestamp: 0421 - 0512 UTC**
> **Origin: Eastern Theater Sensors (Composite)**
> **Note: Transient SIGINT anomaly logged**
> **Summary: PLAN Type 055 DDG *Haiyangshan* entered Taiwan ADIZ at 0421 UTC, approached 10.8 NM off Yunlin County coast, reversed course abruptly and departed on vector 337 within seven minutes of proximity breach. Acceleration profile noted as ‘non-standard.'**

Whitaker's brow furrowed.

He leaned forward, fingers spreading the radar telemetry across the desktop surface. The track lit up: a clean west-to-east path, skirting the edge of Taiwan's territorial claim. Then - an almost immediate pivot and a sharp departure back toward the mainland.

That wasn't doctrine.

He opened the behavioral overlay. A timestamp blinked on the point of reversal. Sub-note:

> **"Maneuver flagged: atypical behavior. Possible avoidance reaction."**
> **"SIGINT - narrow-beam burst transmission initiated at 0430 UTC, duration <2 sec. Encrypted, point-to-point. Unable to decrypt. No RF follow-up."**

Whitaker tapped the log, exporting the waveform to a separate pane. It was clean. Tightband. Laser-like. Probably aimed at fleet command in Guangzhou or Hainan, based on bearing.

No chatter. No follow-up. Just *something* the *Haiyangshan* saw that made it pull a 180 and run hot.

He paged down. The analysis teams had already cross-checked it with Taiwanese coastal defense reactions - nothing. No engagements. No weapons locks. No intercept flights launched.

> "So what the hell spooked a cruiser?" he muttered.

He opened a private note, dictating with crisp, clipped enunciation.

> "Cole Whitaker. Entry for 11 August. Haiyangshan incursion behavior warrants SIGINT escalation. Recommend query to *Silent Fishhook* team for additional telemetry. Cross-reference burst pattern with recent Gaza, Sinai, and South Philippine activity windows for any shared frequency or encryption signatures."

He paused, then added:

> "No confirmation of visual contact on this side. Assume full opsec blackout on PLA end. No media, no comms bleed, nothing. If they saw something, they're not sharing it. But *something* turned that destroyer around."

He ended the recording and leaned back in his chair, frowning at the still-rotating radar track.

A ship like *Haiyangshan* didn't *spook*. Not without cause. Not in full daylight, not in a politically sensitive corridor. The PLAN had spent years acting like the Strait was already theirs - slow, deliberate pressure. Measured.

But this?

This was a flinch.

And Whitaker hated surprises.

### Taiwanese Naval Command, Joint Surveillance Center – Kaohsiung

*0851 NST*

The operations floor was quiet, but not in a comfortable way. Banks of radar screens glowed in sterile tones, their usual pings of fishing vessels and civilian ferries interspersed with yesterday's playback data - specifically, the incursion track of the *Haiyangshan*.

It ran the same loop again and again. Straight in, then a brief jog south, then the hard pivot back toward the mainland.

Commander Liu stood with arms folded beside the primary surface track console, watching the projection silently. Around him, officers murmured, unsure what to make of it. Nothing in the *Haiyangshan*'s profile made sense. No demands. No posturing. No warning shot, no drone flyover. Just... a short sprint toward shore, then a *reversal*.

And that was the part that kept getting under Liu's skin. It *turned back*.

> "Maybe the captain lost his nerve?" one of the junior officers offered, half-joking.

> "The captain of a Type 055?" said another, more senior, not laughing. "Not likely unless he was being stared down by an American cruiser."

> "We already queried Seventh Fleet," added a radar operator without looking up. "No U.S. hulls in the region at the time. Not even submerged assets, at least not that they're admitting."

Liu grunted. He'd already read the reply - clean, boilerplate, without the usual hedging. Which meant either they really weren't there... or *they* were just as surprised.

Another officer spoke from a side console.

> "Telemetry confirms standard emissions until zero-four-three-zero. Then a burst. Tightbeam. Couldn't intercept it. Only reason we even caught it was it clipped one of our coastal SIGINT poles during beam steering."

> "Could it have been an internal fault?" asked someone from the logistics desk.

> "A warship that size doesn't panic because of a broken radar."

Liu turned to the wall display again. The vector replay was annotated now - speed, heading, acceleration curve. It showed the *Haiyangshan* pulling nearly a full knot above its declared max speed as it left the proximity zone. No dawdling. No circling.

> "So," he said aloud, mostly to the room. "What comes into our waters, drifts south like it's about to do the usual stunt, then turns tail and bolts home... *without* provocation?"

No one answered.

Because there *was* no answer.

Not yet.

Liu's gaze lingered on the playback, narrowing as the projected track crossed into shallow territorial water before veering away again.

> "It saw something."

More silence.

The screens kept looping. The ghost of the destroyer traced the same path again. But this time, Liu wasn't looking at the ship.

He was looking at the shoreline.

Where nothing had moved.

And nothing, officially, had been.

## Chapter 2: Sounding the Depths

### South Sea Fleet Command, Guangzhou

*0817 CST*

Admiral Ke Wenli rubbed the bridge of his nose, eyes red from a night spent parsing replay data and silence. No comms, no visuals - just telemetry, an encrypted burst, and a destroyer captain who now insisted, *off the record*, that they'd been watched by machines.

He looked up at the operations map. The coast of Taiwan was lit in deep amber, with a dotted arc tracing the *Haiyangshan*'s strange path the day before. It looked like a partial signature, like a statement interrupted halfway through.

Now, they meant to finish it.

> "Assemble a battlegroup," he ordered. "Three escort frigates. One ELINT trawler. Haiyangshan leads the formation."

His operations chief blinked. "Rules of engagement?"

> "Observe only. No targeting, no radar locks. Passive sensors across the board. We're going in at twenty-five hundred meters off the western shore, running south-to-north along the Yunlin coast."

> "Sir, that's barely a minute of reaction time if - "

> "Which is why we're bringing *everyone*," Ke said flatly. "We show the flag. Quietly. Deliberately. And we see if *they* show up again."

A tense beat passed before someone spoke what others were thinking.

> "What about the Americans?"

Ke turned to face them.

> "They'll see anyway, and I'd rather they not mistake this for escalation. We tell them we saw Landmates on the shore and want to take a closer look. I just need them to stay out of the way, and those things should scare anyone."

No one argued.

No one needed to.

Everyone in the room had seen the Gaza footage - the tank round crumpling like paper against a gleaming humanoid form. The return fire. The fireball. The silence that followed.

Even if they didn't know who made the Landmates, they knew what they were capable of.

Ke walked to the wall display and pointed at the planned route, then tapped the marked vector just shy of the previous reversal point.

> "This time, we don't turn back."

He paused.

> "Unless they give us a reason."

The room nodded.

Orders began to fly. Flight schedules updated. Escorts scrambled from berths. The *Haiyangshan* - still silent about what it had seen - prepared to sail again, this time not alone.

### Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet – Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan

*0913 JST*

Rear Admiral Thoma Vance read the message twice, jaw tight, eyes unmoving.

The paperless dispatch sat open on the conference screen in front of him, tagged from INDOPACOM relay at Pearl and stamped *courtesy advisory* from the People's Liberation Army Navy. Even the language was uncharacteristically tame.

> *"Routine coastal operation, battlegroup movement along western Taiwan Strait. No aggressive intent. Observational pass. Not a signal of escalation."*

And then the kicker:

> *"Suspected presence of Landmate-class units on Taiwanese shoreline. Request all regional actors avoid interference."*

Across the room, Commander Ellison, his chief intelligence officer, folded his arms.

> "They're insisting it's not a provocation. They claim they saw Landmates on the shoreline."

Vance didn't look up. He just muttered - 

> "What, *those* Landmates? The ones from Gaza?"

> "That's the implication, sir."

Vance finally leaned back, exhaling through his nose.

> "Christ."

The silence that followed was long and taut.

No one said what they were all thinking: *China never gave a courtesy heads-up unless it was playing scared.*

Vance rubbed his temple and glanced at the operations display, already updated with the projected route of the Chinese formation. It would bring them within spitting distance of Taiwan's western shelf - low enough to make a statement, but just high enough to stay legal.

> "All right. Send the *USS Gettysburg*. Tell her to shadow the group at twenty klicks, keep them honest. Passive sensors only unless someone blinks. I want it close enough to watch their posture, far enough not to start a goddamn war."

> "Aye, sir. Gettysburg is AEGIS-capable and ready. She's already cycling up from Sasebo."

> "Good."

Vance stood and walked over to the large satellite overlay of the strait. The Haiyangshan's previous track was still ghosted on the display, a crooked line that turned back too early.

> "They're poking the shoreline because something rattled them," he said, mostly to himself. "Something they don't want to admit they're afraid of."

He tapped a knuckle against the display - once, softly - right over the Yunlin coast.

> "Let's find out what."

### Taiwan Strait, 6.2 Nautical Miles Offshore

*1246 CST*

The battlegroup rolled forward in disciplined formation - three Type 054A frigates in a wide V, the ELINT trawler further south like a drifting barnacle, and the *Haiyangshan* spearheading the convoy once more. The waters were calm but carried the low murmur of anticipation, the hum of machines and men waiting for something to happen.

On the bridge of the *Haiyangshan*, Commander Lu Jianjun stood at the forward observation pane, eyes scanning the grey-green horizon. The shoreline had just begun to reveal itself through the haze - Kaohsiung's southern sprawl, boxy and flat, concrete towers faded by humidity.

> "Approaching point four-nine, sir. Begin northeast turn?"

> "Execute."

The helmsman acknowledged, and slowly the ship shifted course, adjusting to the planned run parallel to Taiwan's west coast. The rest of the formation followed seamlessly, curving like a blade being drawn.

In the distance, the American cruiser *USS Gettysburg* loomed just past radar resolution - visible in ISR relays, silent but present, trailing behind like a polite chaperone. Not close enough to provoke. Not far enough to ignore.

> "Still shadowing us?" Lu asked, not turning.

> "Aye, sir. Gettysburg holding 21 kilometers astern. No weapons lock, no jamming. Just watching."

> "Let them. We could use the extra pair of eyes."

Behind him, the bridge was tense, quieter than usual. The atmosphere had shifted from routine patrol to cautious surveillance. No jokes. No extraneous chatter.

Because everyone was waiting for it.

Waiting for a flicker of movement on the shore. For the return of the things *none* of them had seen clearly - things that *only* Lu had looked at directly, and still couldn't quite explain.

He'd filed the report. He'd used the word *Landmates* like the analysts wanted. But whatever they were, they weren't Chinese. They weren't American. They weren't *anyone's*.

And now, they were testing whether those things were still watching.

> "Distance to Yunlin sector?" he asked quietly.

> "One hundred forty-five kilometers, bearing constant. Estimated time on station: one hour, fifteen minutes."

Lu exhaled and tapped a command into the console. Passive optics, long-range magnification, ground clutter filtering. No radar sweep. No active sensors.

Just eyes. And patience.

> "They'll show themselves if they want to," he murmured.

> "And if they don't?" someone asked from behind.

Lu didn't answer.

Because that, in its own way, might be worse.

### *Haiyangshan*, Bridge – 7.3 NM Offshore, Yongxin Harbor Sector

*1339 CST*

> "Radar spike, bearing zero-seven-one. Single contact, shoreline proximity," called the operator at the sensor station, voice suddenly taut.

Commander Lu stepped forward before the echo could fully stabilize.

> "Classification?"

> "Stationary. Large radar cross-section. No IFF. No EM chatter. Just *there*."

Lu was already reaching for the binoculars.

The grey haze along the coast was breaking in places - fishing boats bobbing lazily near the harbor mouth, and beyond them, the dull concrete of the Yongxin fishing piers.

He swept across the docks, slow, methodical. Then - frozen.

There.

Alone, standing upright on the end of the wharf, its metal frame stark against the sea-worn buildings behind it: the Landmate.

The silhouette was unmistakable. Not hunched like a soldier, not cowering like a drone. Upright. Balanced. Watching. The matte plating shimmered slightly in the midday light, catching just enough glare to suggest armor, not paint. Its head - simple, angular, eyeless - was angled *directly* toward the *Haiyangshan*.

Not moving. But not passive.

Lu lowered the binoculars, throat dry.

> "Visual confirmed," he said, voice flat. "One unit. Pier end, Yongxin harbor. It's watching us."

### *USS Gettysburg*, CIC – 22 Kilometers West-Southwest of *Haiyangshan*

*1340 JST*

> "Radar contact, new spike. High-density target. No transponder. Close to shoreline, bearing 085," said Lieutenant Ramirez from the EW console.

Commander John Reyes stepped over.

> "Is it airborne?"

> "No sir, stationary. Land-based. Signature's weird - hard return but no accompanying emissions. Like a brick of metal sitting upright."

> "Visuals?"

The image came up on the ops screen, courtesy of the long-range optics turret. Grayscale at this distance, heat filtered.

There it was. Humanoid. Rigid. Too tall for a man. Proportions *wrong*. The head moved, just slightly, *tracking*. The Landmate didn't need to raise a weapon to be dangerous. It just had to be *seen*.

> "Is that - ?" someone asked.

> "Yeah," Reyes cut in. "That's one of the damn things from Gaza."

Ramirez turned. "What's it doing?"

Reyes stared at the feed.

> "Exactly what it did last time. Nothing."

And that was the problem.

> "Flag this. Route the signal to PACFLT. Priority traffic. Mark it *Unidentified Autonomous System – Persistent Observed*. Let them figure out how to label something that just *stands there and makes battle groups nervous*."

He looked again at the image. Still motionless. Still watching.

And still impossible to explain.

### *Haiyangshan*, Bridge – Off Zengwen River Delta

*1408 CST*

The silence on the *Haiyangshan's* bridge was no longer professional.

It was strained.

Even with no alarms sounding, even with their own ship sailing well within pre-approved parameters, the atmosphere had curdled into something brittle. The crew's eyes kept drifting toward their scopes, toward the glass, toward the shoreline growing clearer by the minute.

Commander Lu stood at the center rail, binoculars in hand, but he hadn't raised them yet. He didn't need to.

You could *feel* it.

> "Approaching Zengwen delta sector," came the quiet voice of the navigator. "Depth stable. Distance to shore: six-point-nine nautical miles."

> "Visuals?" Lu asked without looking.

The optics tech was already on it. The main display shifted, stabilizing on the low floodplain where the river met the sea - mudflats, reed scrub, half-submerged concrete floodwalls. Sparse. Exposed.

And occupied.

> "Four units," said the tech, voice dry. "Marking now."

There they stood - four Landmates, spaced evenly along the shoreline like sentinels carved out of steel and silence. Each one bore a long rifle cradled against its chest - sleek, bullpup-configured weapons shaped for killing, not intimidation.

Their heads weren't facing the river. Or the delta. Or the ground.

They were all turned *slightly*, just enough to track the formation steaming past.

Watching.

> "They're armed," someone muttered.

> "They were armed yesterday too," Lu replied. "And we left in one piece."

He raised his binoculars and focused on the nearest unit.

Even at this distance, you could see the subtle shift of its torso compensating against the wind. Not animated - *aware*. Not twitchy - *calculated*.

One of the other officers spoke up, unprompted.

> "Sir... what happens if they decide we're too close this time?"

Lu lowered the binoculars.

> "Then I hope they're in a polite mood."

He turned back to the command console and keyed in a command, linking passive sonar, thermal, and EM bands into a live telemetry overlay. Nothing. No radar ping. No active sensors. No comms.

Just presence.

And that was enough.

> "Maintain course," Lu said. "Keep the group tight. No sudden corrections. Let them know we see them - and that we're still leaving."

> "Aye, sir."

From the rear of the formation, the *USS Gettysburg* continued to trail at a polite distance, its AEGIS suite sweeping silently, its crew no doubt watching the same things through a longer lens.

Four Landmates, rifles in hand, motionless and monolithic.

Silent border guards of a country that didn't officially exist.

### *Haiyangshan*, Bridge – Approaching Dongshi Township

*1444 CST*

The shoreline had changed.

Gone were the long, empty mudflats and riverbanks. Dongshi's low-rise waterfront now crept along the horizon, marked by concrete piers, scattered boats, and the rust-stained silhouettes of coastal buildings stacked close to the water. The sky was clear, the sea calm. But everyone on the bridge felt it:

Something had shifted.

> "Visual contact," called the optics operator. "Three units. Wharfside."

Commander Lu stepped forward, binoculars already raised.

He scanned the harbor mouth - fishing cranes, mooring lines, empty pallets - then paused.

Movement.

Three dark shapes emerging from the water, just off the edge of the main dock. Not climbing like men. *Rising*. Machine bodies surfacing with precise mechanical grace, water sluicing off smooth armor plates. The first one pulled itself onto the wharf without struggle. The others followed in perfect timing.

All three were Landmates.

And they were armed.

Not with the compact rifles of the sentinels earlier, but with something far more deliberate: long-barreled weapons mounted on their backs, high and angular, with reinforced braces extending from their torsos. Familiar - but heavier. More *serious*.

The kind Lu had seen last time.

> "They're the same platform as before," he said quietly. "Long-range variant."

The crew watched in silence as the machines moved into position, never hurrying, never uncertain. Each one took a knee, stabilizing itself with two arms on the ground. Then their spinal barrels extended forward, locking into ready positions - angled high, precise, *lethal*. One of them adjusted slightly, and Lu had no doubt the targeting profile was being refined in real-time.

They were setting up a fire arc.

> "Formation is steady, sir," reported the deck officer, almost afraid to speak. "Frigates holding course."

> "Maintain speed. No changes."

Lu lowered his binoculars.

> "If they wanted us dead, we wouldn't be having this conversation."

No one laughed.

In the distance, the *USS Gettysburg* had slowed, adjusting its bearing subtly to keep a steady flank position. The American sensors had no doubt picked up the new arrivals. Maybe they were even logging it as artillery emplacement behavior.

And maybe they weren't wrong.

Lu turned back to the shore. The Landmates hadn't moved. But something about them - the posture, the coordination, the sheer *readiness* - spoke to a different level of intent.

This wasn't just a show of force anymore.

This was deterrence. With the safety off.

### Dongshi Wharf – Western Taiwan

The Landmates moved in unison.

Their heads rose - not snapping up, not jerking, but *lifting*, as if all responding to the same silent command. Targeting optics shifted subtly, multi-lens clusters rotating forward, aligning.

Then came the light.

From each Landmate's brow, a narrow beam of brilliant red lanced across the water - pinpoint-straight, unwavering. Not idle illumination. Not threat demonstration.

*Target designators.*

The beams swept briefly across the waves before locking.

One struck the *Haiyangshan* square in the bridge.

### *Haiyangshan*, Bridge – 6.8 NM Offshore

*1446 CST*

Everything turned red.

The forward viewing ports exploded with glare, a burning halo of refracted red light saturating the bridge. Consoles blinked warning glyphs in synchronized pulses. The air was suddenly thick with electronic alerts.

> "EWAR suite reports active targeting lock!" shouted the sensor officer. "Origin matches the shore - unknown class, full-spectrum targeting grid!"

> "It's not just us!" another voice called. "Frigate *Qingdao* and *Ningde* are both lit up - multiple sources!"

Out the port windows, twin red lines speared through the haze, dancing over the frigates' superstructures. One of the beams passed briefly across the *Haiyangshan's* main deck, tracing the base of the forward missile housing before returning to the bridge.

Commander Lu's stomach went cold.

This wasn't a warning.

It was *fire control practice*.

Panic rippled through the bridge crew, hands moving faster than orders, comms spiking with chatter from the other ships.

> "*Qingdao* reports radar burnthrough at sensor mast - source unknown!"

> "*Ningde* says their CIWS just spooled up and *shut itself back down*. No hostile fire but the system thinks it's in a live engagement!"

Lu didn't wait for consensus.

> "Helm, rudder hard to port! New heading 2-7-5, all ahead full, *flanking speed*!"

### *USS Gettysburg*, CIC – 22 KM West of Dongshi

*1448 JST*

Alarms didn't blare, but every man and woman in the *Gettysburg's* combat information center was already on edge. Consoles bloomed with fresh telemetry, overlays crowding as new sources poured in across radar, IR, and optical scopes.

> "Chinese formation is breaking off - repeat, *Haiyangshan* has changed heading!" called out Lieutenant Chen from surface tracking. "New course 2-7-5, high acceleration - flanking speed."

On the main screen, the PLAN battlegroup was already in motion. The sharp turn hadn't been graceful - it was abrupt, corrective, almost *instinctive*. All three escorts were angling with them, spread beginning to fracture as the hasty retreat took shape.

> "They're running," muttered Commander Reyes, stepping up to the display. "Something lit them up."

> "Confirmed," said Chief Petty Officer Vasquez from the electronic warfare console. "Multiple designator beams visible in low-atmosphere scatter. Source is *shoreline*. Tracking confirms three discrete points - likely targeting optics."

The bridge went still.

On-screen, the visual feed cycled - magnification locked onto Dongshi Wharf.

There they were.

Three Landmates, motionless but terrifying in their poise. Back-mounted long guns braced in firing configuration, heads angled in perfect alignment. The red beams slicing out from their visors were crisp, coherent - no diffusion. They looked like lines drawn by a computer, not real light.

> "Designator strength is *absurd*," Vasquez continued, glancing at the waveform diagnostics. "Even from here, we're registering coherent scatter. And that's not all - "

He tapped through to a second display.

> "They're pulsing active radar. Not conventional. It's got spectral bleed into microwave and - Jesus, we're picking it up *over here*, and it's not even aimed at us."

Reyes stared at the readings. The *Gettysburg's* suite had automatically flagged the radar as hostile-grade. Not *targeted*, but *qualifying*. The kind of radar you didn't use unless you expected to engage at range.

> "If anyone thought these are theatre props..." Reyes murmured, "...well, this should change that."

He turned toward the recording officer.

> "Full capture. Every band. I want signal fingerprints logged, and I want it routed to NAVINT, PACFLT, and the White House payload channel. Let them *see* what lit up the Chinese."

> "Aye, sir. Archiving now."

The bridge crew worked silently, heads down, focused.

Outside, the *Haiyangshan* and her escorts were already fading into the haze, back toward the mainland - churned wake lines carving hard across the sea.

The Landmates hadn't fired.

But they hadn't needed to.

### *Haiyangshan*, Aft Observation Deck – Taiwan Strait

*1452 CST*

The bridge alarms faded with the horizon.

Commander Lu stood behind the helmsman, watching the shoreline fall away. The red haze that had soaked the forward bridge only moments before was gone, as if someone had simply *switched it off*. No residual glare. No trailing lock. Just sea, sky, and distance.

> "Targeting lasers disengaged," reported the EWAR officer. "Radar emissions falling off. No pursuit signals. They're standing down."

Lu didn't reply. He'd already stepped toward the portside observation window, lifting his binoculars for a final look at Dongshi.

From this angle, the wharf was clear again, touched by afternoon light and stillness.

But the movement came from behind.

> "Aft lookouts are calling something, sir," said an aide.

Lu was already moving to the rear of the bridge.

There, on the horizon behind them, the wharf was still just visible - angled slightly as the ship cut north-by-northwest. He lifted the glasses again, steadying his breath.

They were moving.

The three Landmates, their long guns folding smoothly back into spine mounts, were rising from their kneeling positions. No rush. No aggression. Just the same cold discipline as before.

One by one, they turned from the waterline, stepped deliberately off the dock's edge, and disappeared beneath the surf - silent entries, metal limbs vanishing below the tide without splash or hesitation. Like they'd never been there.

No one spoke.

A petty officer nearby lowered his own binoculars.

> "They're... leaving?"

Lu didn't answer. His jaw was tight, but not from fear. From certainty.

> *You can stay here. But only until we decide otherwise.*

That's what the display had been. Not deterrence, not bluster.

*Judgment.* On pause.

He turned to the comms officer.

> "Tell the task group: hold this heading. Maintain flanking speed until we're outside the ADIZ."

> "Yes, sir."

The Strait opened before them - wider now, somehow, than the charts suggested. Behind them, Taiwan's western shore remained as still as before. No missile launches. No aircraft intercepts.

Just sentinels.

And the deep.

### Office of Naval Intelligence Annex – Yokosuka, Japan

*1613 JST*

The ONI annex squatted behind the main command building like a bunker too stubborn to be replaced. Its windowless concrete walls were cold under the late afternoon sun, and the steel blast-rated door bore a laminated sticker of a red-skinned Japanese *oni* - clawed, tusked, and grinning. A cultural joke passed down between rotations. The irony had never felt sharper.

Inside, the briefing room lights were dimmed, and the screen at the far end was mid-playback. Footage streamed from the *USS Gettysburg*, stabilized, annotated, zoomed.

Three Landmates. Dongshi Wharf. Red lasers shining like guide rails across the water.

> "Freeze frame," ordered Commander Evelyn Klem, chief analyst on emergent threat behavior. The footage halted at the moment the targeting beams locked.

> "That posture," she said, stepping toward the screen and pointing, "the *red light*, everything in their behavior is the same as in Gaza. All the warning signs before they employ lethal force. I think they were seconds from blowing the bridges off those ships..."

The room stayed quiet. No one disputed it.

To Klem's left, a technical officer tabbed to the waveform display, pulling up EM, radar, and thermal overlays. The radar signature alone was anomalous - tight bursts, focused beams, frequency-hopping patterns the Navy couldn't match in live exercises, let alone field deployment.

> "The spinal weapons didn't fire," said a lieutenant near the back, "but they deployed them in the same manner we'd stage indirect artillery. They stabilized their base, aligned bearings, and held target. We're looking at *prepared fire orders*, not posture."

Klem nodded.

> "Which means this wasn't a threat. It was a withheld *decision*."

A second analyst, pale and quiet, scrolled through the armament profiles side by side with archived Gaza footage.

> "The handhelds from Gaza were hard kinetic. Assault-carbine scale. But these," he said, highlighting the spinal mounts, "these are different. The EM bleed we're picking up is *not* consistent with conventional propellant or recoil dampers."

> "You think they're railguns?" asked someone near the console.

> "At that range? Given the platform's rigidity, thermal signature, and lack of barrel droop? I'd say that's a strong possibility."

Klem folded her arms, looking at the frozen image again - the targeting lasers, the kneeling machines, the patience.

> "So not only are they autonomous, coordinated, and selectively lethal… they're mounting firepower that outranges anything on our destroyers."

She turned back toward the others.

> "Let that sink in. Someone just fielded *mobile railgun artillery* that's smarter than most of our fleet officers, and *twice as patient*."

No one joked.

The oni on the door smiled alone.

### Dongshi Township – Western Taiwan

*1757 CST*

The video was grainy, shaky, and framed by the edge of a rusted fishing vessel's cabin - but it was real.

Three towering figures emerged from the surf one after another, water cascading from their armor as they ascended the wharf with eerie calm. The footage caught the glint of metal as the first unit rose to its full height, spinal-mounted barrel gleaming against the sea haze. Then, like clockwork, they dropped to one knee, braced themselves with both arms, and extended those long, angular weapons forward.

The camera shook slightly as the witness exhaled in awe - or fear.

Then, without fanfare, the video cut to the final shot: the machines turning from the shoreline and silently disappearing back into the water, leaving no trace but the soaked concrete behind them.

It hit social media like an artillery shell.

### CNN Broadcast – *The World Tonight*

*1920 EST*

> "Footage believed to be taken earlier today from Dongshi, on Taiwan's western coast, is stirring global attention tonight," intoned the anchor, voice carefully neutral. "The video appears to show three humanoid machines - known colloquially as ‘Landmates' - emerging from the sea, taking up firing positions with large-caliber weapons, then withdrawing."

The footage played in the background. Stabilized, enhanced. The red target designators didn't show clearly on the amateur clip, but the posture spoke volumes.

> "The United States military has declined to confirm the identity or allegiance of the machines, but a senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated the weapons mounted on their backs ‘appear consistent with direct-fire electromagnetic launchers - potentially *railguns*.'"

The screen split - side-by-side comparison footage from Gaza played alongside today's video. Different weapons. Same presence. Same threat.

> "No shots were fired, and no nation has claimed responsibility. But with rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait, tonight the world is left wondering - who controls these machines? And what happens when they decide not to hold their fire?"

The segment faded out to muted images of the Taiwanese coastline, still and quiet in the evening light.

But for those watching closely, one thing was now undeniable.

The Landmates had stopped being shadows.

They had stepped into the world.

## Chapter 3: Patterns in the Water

### Excerpt from *RogueBoreSight* Military Blog – 0316 EST

> **Title: "They Didn't *Just* Climb the Wharf - They Deployed"**
> *Posted by: BoreSightActual*
> *Views: 2.9M · Comments: 11.4K · Shared: 19.8K*

Alright, buckle up.

By now, you've probably seen the Dongshi footage. If not, *welcome to Earth*. The video's all over social media and already on the evening news. Three units - humanoid frame, armored, tall - walk straight out of the water like it's a dry training lane, climb a pier, and assume firing posture in perfect sync. Then, once their job's done, they turn and disappear back into the drink.

Cool. Creepy. And absolutely worth breaking down.

Let's talk *posture*.

Every single one of these machines gets down on *one knee*, with both *arms* extended to brace on the surface before angling their back-mounted cannon. That's not just "for show." That's weight distribution. Stability. Fire-control discipline.

If you've fired artillery - or even just watched enough footage of it - you recognize the fundamentals:

* Stable platform
* Low profile
* Controlled recoil axis

And yeah, these things aren't firing yet. But if you think they climbed up there to *pose*, you're kidding yourself.

Also: they're using *hands* to brace. That tells us these aren't just dumb bipeds with fixed geometry. These are modular platforms using active environmental feedback to create makeshift emplacements. We've seen wheeled artillery struggle with platform stabilization in soft terrain. These things *walk out of the ocean*, self-correct for slope and deck tension, and enter a fire-ready stance in *less than five seconds*.

Let that sink in.

We're not looking at some sci-fi cosplay here. This is live field doctrine, executed by autonomous units *with naval engagement protocols*. They know where the ships are, they know their fire arcs, and they know how to posture for effect without wasting a single joule of energy.

This isn't escalation.

It's a demonstration.

And they're daring the world to blink.

---

The comment thread was already a warzone - analysts, ex-mil, LARPers, and conspiracy theorists all tearing into the mechanics, arguing over footage frames, obsessing over whether the bracing behavior meant tracked recoil systems or impulse dampeners.

But one thing was clear across every reply, every zoomed still, every slow-motion repost.

Whatever these machines were, they didn't *arrive* at Dongshi.

They *deployed*.

### Central Military Commission – Strategic Intelligence Division, Beijing

*1728 CST*

The briefing room was cold, bright, and unusually quiet.

A stack of printed blog posts sat fanned across the center table - screenshots of viral threads, stills from the Dongshi footage, and circled posture diagrams annotated by some anonymous American reservist with too much time and too many followers.

Vice Director Pang flipped another sheet aside, jaw clenched.

> "They're right," he said finally. "At least about the behavior. We've run the signals from our trawler and the *Haiyangshan* three times. All we know is this: those three units illuminated the group with enough energy to trip every threat indicator on our platforms. Active radar, IR scatter, EWAR interference - hell, even the CIWS on *Ningde* pre-armed."

He stabbed a finger at the next document - extracted EM intensity plots.

> "And the moment the *Haiyangshan* turned, *they stopped*. No EM pulse, no trailing lock. It was like watching a mine *decide* not to explode."

General Liu didn't look up. His eyes were still locked on a looping playback of the footage. The Landmates kneeling. Locking in. Then standing without a word and walking back into the sea like ghosts.

> "You're telling me three machines - human-sized - spoofed our navy into retreating without firing a shot."

> "I'm telling you they didn't *need* to fire."

Pang sighed, setting the papers down.

> "We don't know what their weapons are. But judging by the signal energy and their targeting discipline, the analysts are leaning toward long-range electromagnetic launchers. Railguns. Possibly variable-charge."

> "From *that* size of platform?"

> "They don't care about size. That's the point. No engine bloom. No heat waste. Just energy management and *intent*. Whatever they're using, it makes our naval assets look... reactive."

General Liu was silent a moment longer.

> "So now what?"

Pang glanced down at his own notes. Then answered:

> "If the Landmates are now deployed in Taiwan, *strategy in the Strait must be reevaluated*. We cannot treat the shoreline as unoccupied space. They are watching it. They are *holding* it."

> "And air?"

> "Still viable. Their coverage appears surface-bound for now. We've seen no aerial assets associated with them, and they haven't engaged any aircraft - ours or otherwise."

Liu finally sat back, folding his arms.

> "The optics of backing off the Strait are bad, but survivable. The optics of losing a Type 055 to something that's not even the size of a tank, not so much."

The room nodded as one.

They didn't like it. They didn't have to.

Because the one thing they had learned, the only thing they could confirm, was that the Landmates weren't bluffing.

And bluffing wasn't what scared them.

*Judgment* was.

### People's Liberation Army Air Force – Command Planning Cell, Nanjing Theater

*2031 CST*

The room was dim, lit only by rows of monitors and the pale glow of projected air corridors across the Strait.

Major General Qi Wei stood at the center of the planning table, one hand resting on the edge as his staff detailed the proposed flight plan. On the map, a wide arc traced eastward from Fujian over the Strait, dipping south of Penghu and swinging north again just west of the median line - aggressive, but carefully measured.

> "Two *J-16s*, electronic countermeasure configuration. Standard high-low patrol box," said the operations planner. "Ingress from Wuyishan, descent to sea level between waypoints Charlie and Echo, rise back to 30,000 feet on return leg."

Qi's eyes narrowed.

> "How close do we push it?"

> "Three-point-four kilometers from Taiwan FIR. Legally outside. Practically... uncomfortable."

There were nods around the room.

> "It won't violate Taiwanese airspace," added another officer, "but it'll force a scramble. And their radar stations will see our EM sweep - just passive collection, of course. No jamming."

Qi studied the arc again.

> "I want this framed as a *reassertion*. Not retaliation. We're reminding the region we're still in control of the air picture."

> "Should we expect American reaction?"

> "They'll shadow us with a drone or a recon bird. They won't escalate if we don't cross."

He paused.

> "And we don't cross."

The staff waited as he tapped the table lightly.

> "Ground assets are not our concern for this mission. Whatever those things are on the shoreline, they haven't moved vertically. They've stayed rooted. If they had air interdiction capabilities, they'd have shown them by now."

> "So this is about posture?"

> "Exactly. We retreat from the Strait, we look weak. We *return* from above, we look like we planned all of it."

The room absorbed that.

> "Send the order," Qi said finally. "Wheels up at 0600. Let the world know we're not done."

On the screen, the flight path glowed a little brighter. A needle threading between conflict and caution.

A reminder - not just to Taiwan, but to *everyone* - that China could still fly over its own shadow.

### Philippine Sea – Airborne Early Warning Zone Charlie-4

*0609 CST*

The sunrise over the Pacific was a muted band of gold as two J-16s slipped into the sky from Wuyishan Air Base, their twin afterburners casting long heat shadows across the tarmac before the morning haze swallowed them.

> "Tower, this is Red Blade One. Wheels up, flight vector 1-1-0, climbing to 25,000. Red Blade Two on my wing."

> "Copy, Red Blade. Flight profile confirmed. Maintain bearing to waypoint Alpha. Monitor regional control. Good hunting."

The twin fighters banked gently toward the Strait, their radomes sweeping for telemetry, EW pods already humming with passive collection. No chatter. No aggressive paint. This was all *well inside* the playbook.

And somewhere out there, a thousand watching eyes were already recording them.

---

### USAF Recon Flight – Pacific Command AOR

*0627 JST*

> "Knight Two, this is Homeplate. We have new tracks bearing one-four-five, speed and altitude consistent with PLAN twinjets. Confirm radar signature matches *J-16 Flanker-D* configuration. You're clear to investigate."

> "Copy, Homeplate. Intercept vector received. We're moving in."

Two F-15EXs out of Kadena angled westward, afterburners cold, cruising high and lean. The cockpit chatter was minimal; the mission wasn't complicated.

Watch. Deter. Don't provoke.

Captain Miles Branson, *Knight Two*, had the lead on sensors.

> "They're staying wide," he murmured to his wingman. "Skirting the FIR. Probably flying with a damn lawyer in the backseat."

> "Let's hope so. Because if they aren't..."

His wingman didn't finish the sentence.

The HUD lit up as the Chinese jets grew closer. No lock. No jamming. But the *intent* was visible in the vector - they were brushing the edge of the Strait, a textbook power projection run.

> "Visual in twenty seconds," Branson said.

Far ahead, twin grey silhouettes glinted in the haze, low and fast.

> "Two contacts confirmed. No aggression. No deviation. But I don't like how low they're riding."

> "Yeah," his wingman replied. "It's like they're trying to get someone's attention."

And they were.

### Philippine Sea – Intercept Airspace

*0634 JST*

> "Unidentified aircraft, this is United States Air Force flight *Knight Two* on patrol in international airspace. You are approaching the Taiwan Flight Information Region. Please state your intentions and maintain course outside restricted air corridors."

The transmission was crisp, practiced, and devoid of emotion. It hung in the ether like a polite threat, as it had a dozen times before.

The response, as always, was silence.

---

### PLAAF J-16 Flight – Call Signs *Red Blade One* and *Two*

*0635 CST*

Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Tao heard the American broadcast, acknowledged it only with a glance to his copilot, and continued forward without a word. In the backseat, his ECM officer monitored the signal spectrum.

Nothing new. Routine cat-and-mouse.

> "No reply," came the voice from *Red Blade Two*, Captain Yao Rui. "Americans holding distant parallel. Looks like a loose leash."

Zhang grunted in affirmation. The radar was clean, save for the persistent American shadows at their three o'clock high. The Strait was still a smear on the horizon, barely visible beneath the morning cloud bands. The entire run was calibrated to skirt the threshold - not cross it.

Then his console blinked.

Fast.

> *\[NEW CONTACT: HIGH VELOCITY - AZIMUTH 331 - ANGLE 44° DOWN - CLOSURE RATE 4120 KT]*

His ECM officer's hand froze over the console.

> "Sir - new contact. Coming in hot from above and behind. No ID. No squawk."

> "Repeat that."

> "Two contacts. High closure rate. Ballistics don't match anything in the area."

In Zhang's periphery, the trajectory painted across his HUD like a dagger. He flicked the override, routing raw radar feed to the main display.

> *\[CON 01 & CON 02 – NO IFF – SPEED EXCEEDS TYPICAL INTERCEPTORS]*

Captain Yao's voice came across the channel, sharp now.

> "Red Blade One, confirm: are you seeing this?"

> "Affirmative. We have *company*."

> "They're *descending*. No lock yet - but that speed..."

Zhang didn't reply. He was too busy watching the trajectory steepen.

Whoever - or *whatever* - was coming for them wasn't just fast.

It was already inside their decision window.

### PLAAF J-16 Flight – Eastern Taiwan Strait

*0637 CST*

The sky *broke*.

From above and behind, two angular shapes sliced downward in a controlled dive, banking just enough to bleed speed - if only slightly. Black hulls shimmered in the upper atmosphere's thinning blue, not reflective but not matte either, coated in something that bent light and radar both.

Zhang Tao's head snapped up instinctively. The canopy above shimmered with the shape of them as they crossed into visual range.

Not American.

Not Russian.

*Unknown.*

They were delta-winged, single-tail silhouettes - sleek, impossibly smooth, with almost no discernible engine bloom. The leading edges of the craft looked serrated, sawtooth-angled like some high-tech origami folded in a wind tunnel. No visible weapons. No hardpoints.

But they *moved* like nothing Zhang had ever seen.

One of the newcomers pulled gently into formation with Zhang's own J-16, dropping to his four o'clock, close enough for cockpit-to-cockpit line of sight.

Zhang's breath caught.

On the fuselage, just below the cockpit rail, was a circular emblem:

A wireframe globe encircled by laurels, with two broken swords crossed in saltire beneath it. No text. Just the image.

His copilot spoke first, barely above a whisper.

> "That's the symbol… from the *Gaza footage*. The same as the Landmates."

Zhang didn't answer.

The second black aircraft mirrored its partner, sliding into position beside *Red Blade Two*. Neither made an aggressive move. No locks. No jamming. No threat.

Just presence.

*Domination.*

For several seconds, the only sound in Zhang's headset was his own breathing and the faint rumble of engine vibration.

Then Yao spoke.

> "Red Blade One… what the *hell* are these?"

Zhang swallowed, thumb hovering just above the comms toggle for AWACS. But something in his gut held his hand still.

They weren't under attack.

They were being *watched*.

And from this range, it was clear - this wasn't a coincidence. These aircraft hadn't intercepted them.

They'd *allowed* them this far.

### *USAF Patrol – Callsign Knight Two*

*0638 JST*

The unknowns dropped in from the upper atmosphere like they'd been waiting for a cue.

Captain Miles Branson blinked hard, his HUD suddenly spiking new returns - high angle, near-vertical descent, decelerating with surgical precision. He blinked again, trying to reconcile what he was seeing.

> "Homeplate, this is *Knight Two*. We have two fast movers, descending from high altitude. No IFF. No signature match. Bearing three-three-zero, now taking positions adjacent to the Chinese birds."

> "*Knight Two*, say again - adjacent?"

> "Affirmative. They're *escorting* them."

The two unknowns - sleek, low-profile, aggressively angular - slipped into formation with the J-16s like they'd rehearsed it. One off each Chinese fighter's wing. Not crowding. Not threatening. Just *there*.

And close enough to make their presence undeniable.

Branson stared at his optics feed. The silhouettes were uncanny: all sharp edge transitions and blended geometry, like they'd been sketched from memory after a dream. Every detail screamed *not ours*. No engine glare. No visible control surfaces.

And no wing flex, either. Whatever material those airframes were made of, it wasn't aluminum.

> "Jesus," came the voice from his wingman. "They look like something out of a *sci-fi movie*. You getting that emblem on the side?"

> "Enhancing feed now\..."

The optical zoom stabilized.

Wireframe globe. Encircled laurels. Crossed, broken swords.

Branson's stomach sank.

> "Same insignia the press matched to the Landmates. Confirmed."

There was a long pause from *Homeplate*.

> "Copy, *Knight Two*. Do not engage. Continue passive monitoring. You are not to interfere unless fired upon."

> "Understood. But you'll want this footage piped back to the Pentagon *now*."

No one on the net needed reminding: Chinese fighters operating close to Taiwan was one thing. But being *intercepted* by unknowns - possibly the same force behind the Landmates - and being *allowed* to leave?

That was a message.

And it wasn't for the Chinese alone.

### PLAAF J-16 Flight – East of Taiwan

*0639 CST*

Zhang Tao tilted his helmet slightly, angling the sunshade on his visor to reduce the glare.

Still no visibility.

The canopy on the black aircraft beside him - if it even *was* a canopy - reflected the morning sun in a way that made it impossible to see inside. No motion. No silhouette. Just an opaque shell of seamless armor, more like a visor than glass.

> "Can you see the cockpit?" Zhang asked over the intra-flight channel.

> "Negative," Yao replied from *Red Blade Two*. "No interior profile. No pilot, or at least none I can make out. It's... *blank*. Like a helmet without a face."

Zhang steadied his breathing. The unknown still hadn't moved. No lock. No gestures.

Then, without warning, both black aircraft rolled away from the Chinese fighters in near-perfect sync - belly-up for just a moment, exposing their undersides to the J-16s. The roll wasn't aggressive, but deliberate. Calculated. Like a magician showing the audience his cards.

On the exposed belly of each craft, a hatch slid open - flush and silent.

From within, a circular launch carousel began to rotate outward.

Zhang's eyes widened.

The missile rack was unlike anything in PLAAF inventory - multiple hardpoints in a rotating drum, each holding a distinct payload. Some bore narrow nose cones like high-speed air-to-air interceptors; others were stubbier, heavier, more like bunker busters or exotic strike packages. At least six total, each rotating forward, pausing for one precise second before the next came into view.

> "Do you see this?" Zhang murmured. "They're *showing us*."

> "Every missile, every mount," Yao said, breath shallow. "Like they want us to *remember*."

The carousel completed its rotation and retracted smoothly. The belly hatch sealed shut behind it, edges vanishing into the matte-black skin as if it had never opened at all.

Both aircraft rolled back upright, retaking their flanking positions.

Then, for the first time, *sound* filled Zhang's helmet.

A transmission - not from their comms net, not from AWACS. It bypassed encryption. Direct feed, tight band, invasive.

The voice was unmistakably synthetic.

But it spoke *perfect Cantonese*.

> "You are trespassing. Return to base. Do not attempt to engage us. This is your only warning."

The channel cut clean.

Zhang and Yao stared ahead, frozen.

No threats. No missiles. No weapons fired.

Just *the warning*.

And the *certainty* that whoever - or *whatever* - they were dealing with, was neither bluffing nor human.

### PLAAF J-16 Flight – Returning to Mainland

*0641 CST*

Zhang Tao didn't wait for a second warning.

> "Red Blade Two, we're breaking off. Set course one-eight-zero. Return to Wuyishan. Now."

> "Copy that. Turning."

Both J-16s peeled away from the patrol vector in unison, their sleek grey forms banking sharply westward. No flares. No afterburner. Just quiet urgency, like predators backing out of unfamiliar territory.

The radar returns on the black aircraft shifted almost immediately - *but not toward them*.

Zhang cast one final glance over his shoulder as they climbed away.

The two unknowns had begun a wide, coordinated arc. No chase. No hostility. But they weren't vanishing into the sky either.

They were *repositioning*.

---

### USAF Patrol – *Knight Two*

*0643 JST*

> "Homeplate, this is Knight Two. Chinese aircraft are turning back - bearing one-eight-zero. No aggression. Looks like they're bugging out."

> "Copy, *Knight Two*. Maintain current altitude and track. Continue monitoring unknowns."

Miles Branson exhaled slowly, watching the two black aircraft swing wide in a clean banking maneuver, forming a shallow intercept toward his patrol.

They didn't close fast. They didn't lock weapons.

They just *arrived*.

One glided up on his starboard, the other shadowing his wingman. Matching speed. Matching altitude. No callsign. No communication. Just... presence.

Branson's HUD still showed no IFF.

But the emblem on the side was clear as day.

> "Same birds. Same markings. And they're *with* us now."

His wingman was quiet a beat longer than usual before replying.

> "Yeah. Escorting us home or... *watching what we do next*?"

Branson didn't answer.

Neither did the two black aircraft.

### USAF Patrol – *Knight Two*

*0645 JST*

The unknowns coasted alongside the American flight with eerie steadiness. Not a twitch, not a ripple in the airflow. Even this close, their hulls betrayed no heat signature. The sensor suite kept flagging anomalies - refracted radar returns, irregular edge profiles, a low EM hum that defied classification - but no weapon locks, no threat indicators.

Captain Miles Branson was still processing when the one to his right shifted.

The black aircraft gave the briefest pause… then dipped its starboard wing slowly, a gesture unmistakable in its intent.

> "Did it just *tip* at us?" Branson asked, incredulous.

> "Yeah," his wingman replied. "That looked a hell of a lot like a salute."

The gesture was mirrored by the second aircraft flanking *Knight Two-One*. A quiet nod in steel and angles.

Then they banked up - belly-out - into a slow, graceful roll that exposed their undersides to the F-15EXs. Branson's eyes widened.

> "It's doing the same thing. As with the Chinese..."

There was the hatch. Seamless a moment before, now a perfect ring opening mid-keel. From within, the circular weapon rack emerged again - rotating, deliberate, almost theatrical.

Missile after missile passed through view. Not rushed, not hidden. Stabilized optics captured every detail. Varied profiles: anti-air, deep-strike, one that looked almost like a drone pod. None had markings. None looked like *anything* Branson had ever seen.

But they were *there*. And the message was unmistakable.

> "They're not just letting us look," his wingman muttered. "They *want* us to record it."

The carousel retracted cleanly. Hatch sealed. Both aircraft rolled level once more, drifting back into flanking formation with all the serenity of high-altitude ballet.

> "Homeplate," Branson said, voice low, "we've just been given a full tour of an unknown arsenal. It mirrors the behavior seen with the Chinese aircraft. They're demonstrating capability, not intent."

A pause crackled over the net.

> "Copy that, *Knight Two*. Continue monitoring. Do *not* escalate."

Branson watched the horizon ahead, hands still light on the stick. The unknowns never spoke, never signaled, never blinked.

But they were sending a message louder than anything on the comms.

We are watching you, too.

### USAF Patrol – *Knight Two*

*0648 JST*

Captain Miles Branson squinted hard, craning his neck to get a better look through the canopy glass. The glare off the black aircraft's angular surface distorted the image at first - just reflections, swirling light, and shadows - but something in the cockpit had *moved*.

He leaned further, visor angled low to cut the glare.

There - *inside*.

A figure.

It was faint. Obscured by polarized material, reflections, and whatever coating the canopy used - but there was no mistaking the humanoid silhouette seated within.

> "Knight Two-One," Branson radioed softly, "you seeing a pilot in there?"

> "Negative visual. Why?"

> "I think I just saw\... hold on - *what the hell*..."

The figure turned.

The light shifted - just for a second - and Branson got a clear look.

The pilot was clad in a dark, unfamiliar flight suit. But it wasn't the suit that held his eyes.

It was the *mask*.

Rubber. Simian. *A gorilla*.

And perched atop the oversized head was a perfectly round *bowler hat* - tilted just slightly, jauntily. A plastic cigar, absurdly fat, jutted from between its lips, clenched with comic determination.

Branson blinked. Once. Twice.

The pilot turned their head *directly at him*, raised one gloved hand, and gave him a slow, deliberate *wave*.

> "Knight Two-One," he said, voice faint with disbelief, "I think I'm being waved at... by a gorilla in a hat."

A beat of silence on the comms.

> "Say again?"

> "I'm... never mind."

The wave completed. The gloved hand dropped back to the controls.

Then both aircraft broke formation simultaneously.

They peeled away from the American fighters in a mirrored roll, nose climbing, engines still ghost-silent. Within seconds they were rising near-vertical, twin black streaks piercing the blue above.

Branson watched them go, the vapor trails diffusing like breath on glass.

Five seconds. Ten. Gone.

Just the sky above, and two F-15s alone once again.

> "Homeplate," Branson said quietly, "unknowns have departed at high angle. No further contact."

> "Copy, *Knight Two*. Return to base and submit full visual and sensor logs for debrief."

He exhaled through his teeth, still trying to process what he saw.

> "You gonna tell them about the gorilla?" his wingman asked, half-joking.

> "Not unless I want to end up flying logistics over Guam."

But even as he turned back toward home, Branson couldn't shake the image burned into his mind:

A rubber ape. A bowler hat. A cigar.

And the most powerful aircraft he'd ever seen... *waving goodbye*.

### Kadena Air Base – Okinawa

*0916 JST*

The F-15EXs touched down in tandem, tires whispering against tarmac, braking smoothly under the island's warm morning light. By the time they rolled into hangar cover, a full USAF intelligence team was already waiting. Analysts, tech officers, two ONI observers flown in from Yokosuka - *and* a JAG observer, just in case the conversation took an unexpected turn.

Captain Miles Branson peeled off his helmet and climbed down the ladder, jaw tight. His wingman followed suit, exchanging a glance that said everything: *we're about to get grilled*.

They were herded into a cooled, windowless room within minutes. Water bottles. Pens. Notepads. Cameras off - *but the room was definitely recording*.

Colonel Manning, the base's acting intelligence liaison, opened with a practiced calm.

> "Start from the beginning. Contact with the Chinese aircraft. Arrival of unknowns. Behavior. Demonstrations. Anything anomalous."

Branson laid it out clean. Entry vector. Flight characteristics. The weapons carousel display. The insignia. The controlled behavior, the silent coordination. The withdrawal.

It all matched what the Chinese had seen the day before - but now, with an added layer of complexity. Because this time, the unknowns had come to *them*.

Then came the moment. The one he *almost* chose to omit.

But didn't.

> "Just before they peeled away, I got a visual on one of the cockpits."

The room stilled. Pens paused mid-scratch.

> "It was faint, through glare and canopy polarization. But... I'm confident in what I saw."

> "Go on," Manning said carefully.

Branson took a breath.

> "The pilot - if it *was* a pilot - was wearing a rubber gorilla mask. Big one. Like a Halloween costume. Bowler hat on top. And a cigar - fake, oversized."

Silence.

One analyst blinked. Another turned slowly to glance at the ONI officer, who raised a brow and leaned forward, hands clasped.

> "You're certain?" he asked.

> "I'd stake my flight hours on it. It turned. Looked straight at me. Waved."

His wingman coughed quietly.

> "I didn't see it. I was focused on the flight profile. But... I believe him."

No one laughed.

That was what unnerved Branson most.

Colonel Manning didn't smirk. Didn't frown. Just sat back, scribbled a few notes, and looked up with a tone like a man adding an impossible detail to an already impossible picture.

> "Acknowledged."

The ONI observer finally spoke again, quiet and deliberate.

> "We've had... reports of anomalies in behavior. The Landmates displayed similar traits during post-conflict stand-downs. Salutes. Hand gestures. One reportedly drew a smiley face in the sand after destroying an Israeli Merkava."

He closed his notebook.

> "But this is new."

Branson didn't know whether that was a comfort or a warning.

He only knew one thing for sure:

*Whatever force was behind those black aircraft wasn't just powerful.*

It had a sense of humor.

### Kadena Air Base – Intelligence Annex

*1042 JST*

The secure debrief room had given way to a secondary compartment, deeper inside the annex. Here, the air was cooler, the screens larger, and the coffee worse. Branson and his wingman had been dismissed an hour ago.

But the analysts?

They were *still there*.

Footage of the black aircraft rotated slowly on a tri-screen display: multiple angles from the F-15EXs, filtered and enhanced. Radar signatures, flight profiles, and the now-infamous *weapons carousel sequence* looped silently in the background.

But no one was looking at it.

Everyone was looking at a single frame, paused and zoomed, digitally enhanced to its limits - grainy but unmistakable.

> A pilot.
> A gorilla mask.
> A bowler hat.
> A cigar.
> And a wave.

Lieutenant Reyes from ONI sat forward, elbows on the table, face half-buried in his palms.

> "This is either psychological warfare... or the most elaborate shitpost in military history."

One of the junior analysts, Hayes, stared at the image like it had insulted his ancestors.

> "You're telling me we've got fifth-gen-plus black aircraft that can outperform *everything* in the sky, operate in silence, deploy weapons we can't identify - and they're flown by goddamn *joke pilots*?"

> "Not a joke," Reyes muttered. "A *choice*."

Manning, arms crossed near the back wall, finally spoke.

> "If it were just for laughs, they could've gone further. This wasn't chaos. It was calibrated. They showed us firepower. *Then* they showed us absurdity."

He pointed at the screen.

> "It's a mask, but it's also a signal. They're telling us: ‘We don't play by your logic. Your escalation ladders, your red lines, your doctrine? Meaningless to us.'"

Another analyst, Park, looked up from a transcript of Branson's testimony.

> "Or it's a misdirection. Psychological pressure. Undermine the enemy's confidence by making them question *everything*. Capability, intent... even sanity."

Reyes leaned back with a humorless laugh.

> "You know what this is? It's a *flex*. They're saying: ‘We're so far ahead, we can show up dressed like clowns and still own the sky.'"

Nobody disagreed.

The silence that followed wasn't confusion anymore.

It was unease.

Because the only thing more terrifying than a force with overwhelming technological superiority…

…was one that could *afford to be whimsical*.

*1125 JST*

The absurdity of the bowler-hatted gorilla had finally run its course - left behind on a still frame, flickering on the far monitor like a taunt no one wanted to acknowledge anymore. Now, the room was thick with data. Sensor logs, spectral analysis, thermal traces. The real meat of the encounter.

And it was worse than strange.

It was *impossible*.

Reyes was hunched over a shared console, eyes darting between radar snapshots and telemetry overlays. He tapped the screen with the back of a pen.

> "Okay. Setting the circus act aside - here's what the logs are giving us."

He enlarged a radar return.

> "Both aircraft gave signature returns *comparable* to an F-22 at standard cruising profile. Not invisible - *low observable*. Enough to track if you know what to look for. But then - watch this."

He jumped ahead in the timestamp to the weapon carousel moment. A beat passed.

> "Doors open. Signal *spikes*."

Park nodded.

> "Same as ours. We've seen it on Raptors - payload doors open, radar cross-section flares. That *shouldn't* happen on a drone, or a decoy. These were physical, functioning, and armed."

Reyes flipped to infrared overlays.

> "And here's where it gets even weirder."

Across the room, Hayes squinted at a slowed-down video segment.

> "You guys might want to see this. The engines are the *wrong color*."

> "Wrong how?" Manning asked.

Hayes pulled up a magnified rear-angle still. The footage was heat-filtered, calibrated against known USAF engine profiles.

> "Look at their exhaust nozzles - when you look at our jets, they glow orange-red. That's the burn profile for JP-6. You get that at about 1,500 to 2,000 kelvin."

He pointed.

> "These are glowing *blue*. Deep cobalt. That's either a *plasma effect* or they're burning an order of magnitude hotter. Either way, those *aren't jet engines* as we understand them."

A long silence.

Then Reyes added:

> "We pulled spectral data from the IR bloom. Peaks in the near-ultraviolet. Whatever those engines are doing, it's beyond chemical combustion. This is high-energy ionization. *Advanced propulsion*. Not theoretical. *Operational*."

Manning's jaw worked slightly, but he kept it together.

> "Weapons?"

> "Nothing matches our inventories," Park replied. "But we can infer *intent* from shape and mounting. At least one air-to-air class, likely infrared-seeking. One stubby pod with heavy shielding - probably deep-penetration air-to-ground. Another... looks like it could be *cluster munitions*, or some kind of loitering swarm package."

He paused.

> "Nothing exotic in shape - just *unfamiliar*. They want us to understand the roles, but *not* the tech."

Reyes leaned back, folding his arms.

> "Which means whoever's behind these things isn't just advanced. They're being *careful*."

Manning nodded slowly, eyes narrowing at the rotating model of the black aircraft now spinning silently on the main display.

> "They want us to *know* just enough."

A long pause filled the room, broken only by the hum of the air conditioning.

And the sense - shared by every analyst there - that somewhere, someone had just opened a new playbook.

And Earth's militaries weren't the ones holding it.

### The Pentagon – Secure Conference Room 3B

*1506 EDT*

The lights were low, the blinds drawn tight, and the room was full - DoD analysts, ONI and DIA liaisons, physicists in pressed shirts, and three suited aerospace engineers from Lockheed, Boeing, and DARPA. The Pentagon didn't call this sort of meeting lightly.

At the front of the room, a large screen displayed the rotating visual of the black aircraft - multiple angles, thermal overlays, and a flashing tag: *UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL VEHICLE – CALLSIGN UNKNOWN*.

A second screen split between IR readings and full-color stills from the Kadena flyby. The moment both aircraft rolled belly-up and displayed their weapons - the gesture now underlined in every report as both *intentional* and *calculated*.

Dr. Madeleine Konetz, a plasma physicist from Caltech, tapped a laser pointer against one of the thermal slides, her voice crisp and composed despite the sheer absurdity of the situation.

> "Based on the coloration alone, we're looking at combustion or ionization temperatures *above* 2,500 kelvin. That's deep into blue-plasma territory. Possibly even venting into the near-UV band. If that were chemical, the fuel would be exotic beyond anything we currently deploy. And if it's not chemical..."

She hesitated.

> "Then we're in territory I'd call *post-combustion propulsion*. High-energy plasma drive. Field-constrained fusion, maybe. But that's still fiction, not tech."

One of the Lockheed engineers - grey at the temples, name patch reading *Cooper* - nodded grimly.

> "We ran our own simulations. Nothing we have - not a turbine, not a scramjet, not even any of the testbed hybrid-cycle systems DARPA's played with - could run *anywhere near* that heat envelope. The flame temp alone would strip the blades off a turbine within seconds."

He leaned forward, flipping to a slide of internal engine cross-sections from known platforms.

> "Even the SR-72 mockups cap out at 1,600, maybe 1,700. After that, the materials just *stop cooperating*. You get spalling, deformation, then structural failure. Heat shielding buys you a few seconds. Not minutes. And certainly not *holding pattern hover* next to a fighter."

A third expert, Dr. Shin from the National Materials Lab, added quietly:

> "And let's not forget - it didn't melt itself, and it didn't melt the airframe. The thing just sat in a holding pattern next to our birds, engines apparently barely ticking over, with *no heat distortion* and *no degradation*. And I say *barely* because we saw them leave on the video - they *launched* directly upwards like they were shot out of a gun, so they must have had *plenty* of power to spare."

The room was quiet for a moment. Not out of disbelief - no one could *deny* what the sensors showed. But because they were running out of explanations that didn't sound like science fiction.

One of the ONI officers, a Commander O'Neal, spoke next. He tapped his pen lightly against the folder in front of him.

> "We're not using the *A-word* yet. But what we have here is a platform we can't track properly, flying a propulsion system that shouldn't exist, carrying weapons we can't identify, and piloted - *allegedly* - by someone wearing a rubber gorilla mask."

> "With a bowler hat," added one of the DARPA reps, dryly.

Murmurs swept the table.

The Lockheed engineer closed his folder and said what no one else wanted to.

> "We're not dealing with a breakthrough in aerospace design. We're dealing with a *paradigm shift*. This thing doesn't just beat us. It *bypasses* everything we understand about flight, heat, and materials."

Someone else muttered:

> "So what the hell *is* it?"

Silence.

Then O'Neal, low and grim:

> "Maybe the question isn't *what*. Maybe it's *who's showing it to us, and why now.*"

No one had an answer.

And worse - no one wanted to say the only explanation they couldn't disprove.

### The Pentagon – Secure Conference Room 3B

*1528 EDT*

"…and even *if* they were using inertial dampening - if that's even possible - the G-forces involved in those turns would liquefy a pilot unless the cockpit was operating in a completely different frame of reference," one of the DARPA engineers was saying, fingers stabbing at a simulation on the screen. "We're talking sustained accelerations that no known airframe could survive, let alone a human inside."

Another analyst chimed in, voice strained.

> "We clocked the ascent profile from Kadena at nearly 400 meters per second vertical. That's higher than an F-22's *emergency burn rate*. But these two weren't punching out of a dogfight - they just floated up and *left*, like it was nothing."

> "So we're assuming it was unmanned," someone muttered.

That was when the former pilot in the room, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Victor Rourke, who'd been silent so far, suddenly sat up straight.

Eyes wide. Almost grinning.

> "You know what? That guy was a *human*! And I know that because I know who else pulled the *same shit* he did - *Jack Woolams*!"

Everyone turned.

> "Woolams," Rourke repeated, standing now, pacing once. "Back in the forties. Lockheed test pilot. *XP-59 Airacomet*. First American jet. He used to fly up next to prop planes at altitude, *in a gorilla mask*, bowler hat, *cigar in his teeth*, just to freak the poor bastards out."

He stabbed a finger at the image on the screen - still paused on the masked pilot's wave.

> "This isn't an alien. No way. This is *a joke*. A call-back. A tribute. *Only another human* would make the same joke."

Silence.

Then a slow shift in posture across the room. Thoughtful. Less alarmed. No less puzzled.

Reyes, the ONI analyst, leaned forward.

> "So you're saying whoever's flying these things wants us to *know* they're one of us."

> "I'm saying," Rourke replied, "they're not trying to scare us. Not really. They're trying to send a message in *our language*. And not in Mandarin. Or Russian."

He paused.

> "They waved. They *clowned*. But they also showed us they could cook us alive and be gone before we got our safeties off. And then they left."

Manning frowned.

> "Which leaves us with one hell of a question."

> "Yeah," Rourke said. "*Who the hell has this tech - and why haven't we heard of them until now?*"

No one had an answer.

But suddenly, "alien" didn't feel like the scariest option anymore.

It was the possibility that they'd been *American* all along… and had simply stopped telling the rest of the world what they were building.

### Beijing – Strategic Intelligence Bureau

*0040 CST*

The lights in the underground conference room were harsh, clinical, and very much not designed for 18-hour days. A wall of displays cycled through aerial telemetry, radar traces, filtered infrared sweeps, and raw black box logs pulled from the two J-16s.

The officers in the room - naval intelligence, aerospace warfare, electronic surveillance - were exhausted, angry, and above all, *baffled*.

General Liu stood at the head of the table, his voice clipped.

> "Summarize."

The lead analyst didn't hesitate.

> "The J-16s picked up radar anomalies from extreme high-angle contacts at roughly 40,000 meters. Initially dismissed by the onboard AI filter - too steep, no known airframe can enter from that trajectory without hypersonic thermal signatures."

He tapped the screen. Flight path overlays populated with spiraling arcs from high altitude, converging behind the Chinese fighters.

> "But the logs are clear. Tracks initiated at near-vertical angles, and their velocity decay pattern suggests deceleration in-atmosphere."

Liu's eyes narrowed.

> "You are telling me these aircraft entered from *orbit*, decelerated in-atmosphere, then positioned themselves with centimeter precision next to our pilots - and *not a single satellite* picked up the launch or descent burn?"

No one spoke for a moment. Then one of the aerospace officers spoke, carefully.

> "As far as our radars can tell, sir, *that is correct*. We didn't pick up a launch because there wasn't one in the first place. As far as we're aware… they were *already in orbit*, or beyond, and they just came down into the atmosphere to tell us off."

The silence that followed was total.

Liu looked from one grim face to another.

> "So these are *spaceplanes*? Orbital strike craft?"

> "That would be a generous term, sir," replied the analyst. "We haven't seen orbital behavior like this from any nation. Not even close. There's no heat bloom, no thermal plume, *no* hypersonic ion trail. Just... entry. Controlled. Silent. Surgical."

Another officer scrolled through the cockpit recordings from the J-16s. The moment the Talons flanked them. The red warning flash of missile racks exposed. The voice in Cantonese: *You are trespassing. Return to base. Do not attempt to engage us.*

> "Whoever they are," he muttered, "they watched us the entire way, and could have swatted us out of the sky the moment they showed up."

Liu folded his arms, staring hard at the looping flight data, and the way it intersected with Taiwanese airspace.

> "These Landmates, these aircraft - *who* do they belong to? Not the Americans, not the Japanese. No one claims them. No one *dares* claim them."

> "Then we must assume," said one of the quieter men near the back, "that whoever commands them is not *answering to any nation*."

Liu's voice came low and tight:

> "Then we are not dealing with an escalation."

He turned from the screen.

> "We are dealing with a *chaperone*."

### Beijing – Central Military Commission

*0312 CST*

The mood in the chamber was glacial.

The usual posturing - absent. The usual resistance to hard truths - muted. Only one thing dominated the war room now: the weight of what had been seen.

The video feeds had looped again and again. The masked pilot. The precision descent. The vertical departure. The blue-flamed, nameless aircraft flanking China's most advanced fighters as if playing with toys. The voice that had spoken to them *in their own language*, not with bravado, but a warning.

*This is your only warning.*

General Secretary of the CMC, Marshal Qiao, folded his arms, eyes dark.

> "I want options. Not just analysis. Options."

General Liu, still weary from his own briefing downstairs, straightened.

> "Sir. Military pressure - whether naval, air, or even just surveillance flights - will only invite escalation. Not with Taipei. With *them*."

> "You're suggesting full withdrawal?"

> "No, sir," Liu said. "I'm suggesting a *realignment*. We don't lower our guard. We reposition assets defensively. We push forward *diplomatically* - apply pressure through political channels, through proxies. No more show-of-force operations. Not until we understand who or what we're dealing with."

A civilian advisor at the far end scoffed.

> "That's surrender in everything but name."

Marshal Qiao glanced over, expression unmoved.

> "It is *not* surrender," he said. "It is *containment*. Of risk."

He turned to Liu.

> "Give it to me plain."

Liu nodded.

> "Sir - backing down in the face of *insurmountable power* is still less damaging than being seen *losing* to it. If we escalate and they respond with force, and the world sees us lose a Type 055 or a J-16 on camera - *without a shot fired in return* - we lose far more than just a vessel."

He paused.

> "We lose face. Permanently."

Another general spoke, slowly.

> "And what's worse... the world will *agree* with them."

No one argued.

Not even the hawks.

Finally, Marshal Qiao turned to the operations director.

> "Issue stand-down protocols for further close-in passes. Reclassify the Taiwan Strait as ‘highly monitored with latent threat presence.' Frame the withdrawal as rotational. We shift the game to the diplomatic arena."

> "And if Taipei gets bold?"

> "Then they get bold," Qiao said flatly. "We watch. We document. We wait. And we *do not* provoke whatever entity sent those aircraft."

He looked back toward the feed looping silently on the wall.

A black shape in the sky. A gorilla mask. A wave. And then gone.

> "Until we know whose leash they're on... I'd rather not find out what happens when they pull it."

### Open Source Intelligence Community – Global

The footage dropped quietly.

No watermark. No official statement. No origin traceable to Kadena or any U.S. command. But it *was* real - multi-angle F-15EX gun camera footage, stabilized and enhanced, followed by sensor overlays from radar and infrared suites. It didn't matter how carefully the leaker tried to obscure the source.

Within twenty minutes, it was everywhere.

The internet - especially the defense OSINT corners - *exploded*.

**@AeroCryptid**

> Remember how scary the Landmates were?
> THESE are their air cover, and this is even more terrifying.

**@WarOnEverything**

> Can't ID the airframe. Can't ID the signature. Can't ID the weapons. Whoever built this doesn't care if we see them - they're *showing off*.
> That's not a doctrine I've ever studied. That's *confidence*.

**@WVRWatchdog**

> Let's talk about the missile bay. That one with the dozens of micro-charge ports? Area-effect AA, almost certainly. Could be loitering munitions.
> No cannon visible. No ventral hardpoints. But don't kid yourselves. That hull hides something. Something big.

**@JaneIntelAnalysis (Jane Wetherby, ex-RAF)**

> The climb rate is insane. So is the approach vector. And I don't care how much DARPA funding someone got - no one builds a craft that glows *blue* at idle and then vanishes into low orbit like it's skipping traffic.

The fear beneath the snark wasn't hard to read. Even the loudest voices - veteran pilots, engineers, amateur trackers with declassified-grade insight - *didn't know what they were looking at*. And it terrified them.

**@Ghost\_Majors**

> Everyone keeps trying to make it fit into tradition. "Oh maybe it's a variant of X, or a modified Y." Guys - what if it isn't? What if it doesn't *fit*?

But it was **@AegisSix**, a former Naval analyst turned mil-blogger, who distilled the mood in one post that would go viral across both defense circles and public discourse:

> I keep thinking this is some insane black project, like Lockheed went crazy or something.
> But the more I look, the more I think nobody on Earth can build this.

And beneath that post, a single reply rose to the top, retweeted more times than the original:

> *Maybe we were never meant to.*

## Chapter 4: The Disavowed

### Off the Coast of Taiwan – ROC Listening Post 7

*2039 TST*

For weeks, the Strait had held its breath.

No close naval passes. No airspace games. Just patrols behind the line and politicians grasping at indirect pressure. The Taiwanese operators had settled into quiet, mechanical vigilance. Even the alert status had slipped back down from hair-trigger to routine.

Until the radio shrieked.

At first, it sounded like a garbled emergency beacon, clipped English bleeding through static on *Ch. 16* - the maritime emergency frequency. Operator Huang adjusted the dial, expecting a civilian mayday.

But then the voice came through - clear, shaken, and deliberate.

> "To everyone receiving. Haiyangshan. Lakan. Feiya. Shezen. Baizou. Acting without official orders. Disavowed. Intercept, weapons free."

A chill swept through the bunker.

The voice repeated, looping. It was male, Mandarin-accented, and spoke with the taut cadence of someone trying very hard not to panic. After a few loops, the broadcast *hopped frequencies* - sliding to VHF civilian bands, then over to UHF naval protocols, even bleeding briefly into air traffic control. It was moving from frequency to frequency, desperately wanting to be heard.

> "To everyone receiving. Haiyangshan. Lakan. Feiya. Shezen. Baizou..."

Huang was already standing.

> "Sound the public alert. Now."

### Taipei – Ministry of National Defense

*2051 TST*

Red banners crawled across every classified screen as the emergency protocol went live. Inside the secure floor, the message was already playing in loop, with Chinese characters overlaying the vessel names. Naval analysts were scrambling to confirm IDs.

> "Sir - those are all PLAN vessels. Type 055 and Type 054 frigates, all homeported in the eastern fleet."

> "What the hell do they mean by *‘disavowed'?*"

> "I don't know, but *China's not denying it.*"

### Taipei – American Institute in Taiwan

*2056 TST*

Phones lit up like flares.

Director Kate Halvorsen had barely made it to the desk before a comms officer pressed a handset into her hand.

> "It's the PRC. Defense liaison. Line one."

She didn't bother with pleasantries.

> "What is going on?"

The voice on the other end came fast, clipped, uncharacteristically stripped of the usual diplomatic theater.

> "The vessels named in the transmission are part of a training squadron, but they are *not* responding to command and *did not receive orders* to sortie. We believe they are in motion."

> "Motion where?"

> "Unknown. We cannot reach them. *We did not authorize this.*"

> "So you're telling me your warships have gone rogue."

Silence.

> "We are attempting to prevent conflict. Please ensure your forces understand we are not initiating hostilities."

Halvorsen's eyes were already on the comms officer.

> "Yokosuka. Now. Get this flagged - FLASH OVERRIDE."

The comms officer's face tightened.

> "Yes ma'am."

### Yokosuka Naval Base – U.S. Seventh Fleet Command

*2102 JST*

The message hit with the speed and clarity of a blade.

**FLASH OVERRIDE – EYES ONLY – PRIORITY-0**
**SUBJECT: ROGUE CHINESE NAVAL ELEMENTS – POSSIBLE LIVE SORTIE**
**IDENTIFIERS: HAIYANGSHAN – LAKAN – FEIYA – SHEZEN – BAIZOU**
**STATUS: DISAVOWED BY PLA NAVAL COMMAND – BROADCASTING INTERCEPT AUTHORIZATION**

Rear Admiral Vance's jaw locked as he read the communique aloud to his staff. The room had fallen dead silent.

> "Intercept. *Weapons free*," he repeated, quietly. "That's not a warning. That's an execution call."

The intelligence chief looked up, pale.

> "Sir, if China's issuing an open kill order on its own ships…"

Vance didn't look away from the screen.

> "…Then something's happened we're not supposed to see."

He turned toward the operations officer.

> "Get every available ISR bird airborne. I want satellites repointed, subs tracking wake signatures, everything we've got under the water. And put Kadena on scramble alert. If these things breach the strait - "

He didn't finish.

He didn't have to.

### CNS *Haiyangshan* – Off the Fujian Coast

*2047 CST*

Captain Lu Jianjun stood alone on the bridge, the decklights dimmed to battle-readiness. At forty-eight, twenty-four years of naval service had etched lines of command into his weathered face. Outside, the stars barely glimmered behind high-altitude haze. The water was smooth, black, and complicit.

In his left hand, he held a photograph - his grandfather in the uniform of the People's Volunteer Army, taken before crossing the Yalu River in 1950. Three generations of Lu men had served the nation. Tonight, he would be the last.

The *Haiyangshan* cut through the water like a blade.

Below decks, the combat systems were already powered. Missile tubes primed. CIWS on standby. Fire control synced with the rest of the flotilla - *Lakan*, *Feiya*, *Shezen*, and *Baizou* - all of them maintaining EMCON silence except for their tight-beam tactical links.

No pings. No beacons. Just ghosts in the dark.

> Ninety-one minutes to Taipei.

They'd slipped the dock at Fuzhou just after dusk, claiming systems testing as cover - routine drills to mask the real operation. Lu had signed the falsified orders himself, each stroke of his pen another step toward treason. They'd known it wouldn't hold long. Not with the kind of power watching the Strait now. But long enough.

Long enough to fire. Long enough to matter.

Lu paced back to the chart table, where a physical map lay splayed beneath transparent overlays of radar ranges, coastal artillery arcs, and urban sprawl. He traced a finger down the western edge of Taiwan, stopping at a pinpoint. His grandfather's photograph lay beside the charts - watching, judging.

**Target Reference: ROCMOD 1A – Taipei Command Nexus**
**Time to Strike: 00:18 CST**

This was the plan. Months in the making. Born not from madness, but from love - love of country twisted by frustration into something unrecognizable.

It hadn't started with madness. It had started with *certainty* - certainty that unification was China's destiny, written in blood and sacrifice across generations. That the Americans would never permit it. That Beijing's politicians lacked the will to reclaim what was rightfully theirs.

And now… the world had changed beyond recognition.

The Landmates. The black aircraft. The grotesque, silent warnings. Superiority beyond comprehension. *Compliance through awe.* 

Lu had watched them emerge from the sea that first time, watched his destroyer's weapons systems become toys in comparison. He'd felt his life's work - his grandfather's legacy - rendered obsolete in a single moment. Every naval battle studied, every tactical doctrine mastered, every promotion earned through competence rather than connections - all meaningless before entities that could walk on water and casually threaten the most advanced warship in the PLAN fleet.

He and the others - the cadre of true believers buried in the upper decks of the PLA Navy - had watched Beijing's response with growing horror. *Accommodation. Negotiation. Delay.* While foreign forces established themselves as arbiters of Chinese sovereignty.

Now the curtain was coming down on China's century of humiliation, not with triumph, but with submission to alien overseers.

They would strike before the illusion of peace hardened into permanent subjugation. Before the strange machines on Taiwan's shores became permanent gatekeepers of the Strait. Before *whatever power* controlled them decided China's future for her.

This would be a *signal* - not of madness, but of refusal. China would not kneel. Not while Lu Jianjun still drew breath.

Not to Taipei. Not even to Beijing.

But to *them*.

The doors hissed open behind him.

Commander Gao entered, grim-faced. Lu tucked the photograph into his uniform pocket.

> "The emergency broadcast was sent. They know we're rogue."

> "Good," Lu said flatly, his voice carrying the weight of generations. "Let them understand we act by choice, not cowardice."

> "Yokosuka will have eyes on us within the hour."

> "They'll hesitate," Lu replied. "The Americans always do when the moral calculus isn't clear. By the time their politicians find their spines, we'll be in strike range."

He looked once more toward the forward bridge windows. The darkness ahead was uninterrupted. But he knew - somewhere in it, something was watching. Something that had already measured his ship, his weapons, his resolve, and found them... quaint.

> "Maintain speed. Do not break formation. No transmissions. We move like we planned."

Gao hesitated. "Captain, do you truly believe this will change anything?"

Lu turned, and for a moment the facade of certainty cracked. In his eyes was not madness, but the terrible clarity of a man who had stared into the abyss of his nation's obsolescence.

> "It will show the world that some Chinese still remember what honor means. That we would rather die as patriots than live as vassals."

Gao nodded slowly.

> "For the Republic?"

Lu's expression hardened again, but there was something almost gentle in his voice - the tone of a teacher explaining a difficult lesson.

> "No, Gao. For the *truth*. The truth that some things are worth dying for, even when dying changes nothing."

And far beneath the hull, rows of vertical launch cells waited silently for the final command.

### Beijing – Zhongnanhai, Central Leadership Compound

*2112 CST*

The corridors were lit, but no one noticed.

Phones buzzed. Doors slammed. Staffers sprinted from office to office clutching printouts that were already out of date. Inside the Politburo Situation Chamber, red lighting bathed the room in a sterile, bloody glow. It was not ceremonial.

It was *real*.

A naval liaison officer stood at the head of the table, pale under the harsh lighting, clutching a tablet as if it might burn him.

> "Confirmed. The *Haiyangshan*, *Lakan*, *Feiya*, *Shezen*, and *Baizou* sortied from Fuzhou at 2003. They are en route south - on direct bearing for Taipei. Estimated time to weapons range is eighty-four minutes."

Defense Minister Ji slammed a hand on the table hard enough to rattle the glasses.

> "*Why* weren't we informed the moment they left port?!"

> "Sir, they falsified their sortie orders. Port command believed they were conducting electronic warfare drills. Their IFFs still read green until twenty minutes ago."

> "*How* does a Type 055 just ‘walk out of harbor' under a fake drill tag?!"

The room was silent for a beat too long.

Premier Ren sat stiffly in his chair, eyes unreadable.

> "You said they're not responding to hails."

> "No sir. All five have gone comms silent. The only signal came from *our* emergency broadcast - the one we authorized to warn the region."

> "So the Americans know."

> "Yes sir. And the Japanese. And the Taiwanese."

Another silence.

> "And what," Ren asked finally, "*will they think* when our own navy starts firing missiles at Taipei?"

A foreign affairs official near the end of the table cleared his throat with visible discomfort.

> "They will assume we've gone mad. Or that we've lost control of our military. Possibly both."

> "Have we?" Ji snapped.

No one answered.

> "Then someone *say it*. Say it out loud. Say what this is."

A general stood.

> "It's a coup. Not in Beijing. In the fleet. It's a rogue strike to provoke escalation - or worse, to try and reassert control through chaos. *They* are forcing us into a corner."

> "Then they're traitors."

> "Yes, sir."

> "And what do we do with traitors?" Ji growled.

> "We *kill* them."

Premier Ren's voice was quieter, but far more dangerous.

> "Not just *kill*, General. *Erase*. No flag-draped disgrace. No funerals. Not even names in books. These men will be airbrushed from history."

> "Can we still stop them?" someone asked.

> "We don't need to," Ji said grimly. "If they fire, the Americans will act. Or *someone else will*."

No one said it aloud, but the shadow hung in the air:

The *black aircraft*. The *gorilla pilot*. The Landmates, standing silent like statues across Taiwan's shores. Waiting.

Watching.

> "Issue the second broadcast," Ren said finally. "Let the world know again. We did *not* order this. We do *not* condone it. And we are doing everything we can to stop it."

His eyes were hard now.

> "Even if that means someone else stops it *first*."

### Kadena Air Base – Okinawa

*2119 JST*

The sirens blared before the klaxon even finished winding up.

Pilots sprinted across the tarmac under roiling floodlights as crews rolled munition carts into position, reloading what had just hours ago been a quiet tarmac. Hangar doors yawed open in unison as the orders came down from Pacific Command, each line heavy with grim finality:

> **FLASH OVERRIDE**
> **SURFACE ENGAGEMENT PROBABLE – ROE GREEN**
> **SCRAMBLE ALL AVAILABLE AIR ASSETS FOR INTERDICTION FLIGHT – COORDINATE WITH 7TH FLEET TASKFORCE**
> **ESTIMATED HOSTILE STRIKE INBOUND TAIPEI: T-70 MINUTES**

Captain Ellie Morse's boots hit the ladder before her name finished echoing through the comms shack. Her F-15EX's canopy was already rising as her ground chief gave her the thumb.

> "Hot start, ma'am. We fueled it when the alert came through."

> "Weapons?"

> "Loaded and tagged. Dual AMRAAMs, LRASM, JASSMs underwing. You're flying into surface war, not air-to-air."

> "Copy."

She vaulted into the cockpit.

Across the line, fighters from the 44th and 67th squadrons began taxiing under full afterburner. No formation launches. No checks. The priority was *speed* - as fast and as hard as the platform would go.

By the time the second wave was taxiing, the first was already airborne - eight aircraft burning east-southeast in formation, throttles pushed past safety recommendations. A distant rumble built across the tarmac as more turbines roared to life.

Up in the tower, a Navy liaison from Yokosuka turned away from his secondary terminal, face tight.

> "Fleet assets are en route. *Blue Ridge*, *John Paul Jones*, *Gettysburg* - they're pushing flank speed. Subs are converging. Everyone's moving."

The Kadena base commander didn't look away from the plot.

> "ETA to contact?"

> "Fifty-seven minutes, if we catch them before weapons release."

> "If?"

The officer hesitated.

> "We don't know their targeting sequence. If they're preloaded and on a timer... we might be too late."

No one spoke for a moment.

Out over the darkening Pacific, the contrails of the first intercept flight arced toward the horizon - ghost trails of urgency, burning a path toward five names that had ceased being Chinese ships.

Now, they were targets.

Disavowed. Rogue. And armed.

### Taipei – Civil Defense Command Center

*2126 TST*

The tone of the sirens had changed.

Not the usual air raid wail, nor the intermittent pulse of a weather alert - this was the long, unbroken scream that most citizens had only ever heard in drills. Now it was real. All across Taipei, coastal districts lit up with flashing red strobes atop poles, street corners, and municipal buildings. Along the Tamsui River and at the edges of New Taipei, the announcements rolled in heavy Mandarin over loudspeakers:

> "This is a civil defense emergency. All citizens within five kilometers of the coast are to evacuate inland immediately. Follow designated shelter routes. Do not return to your homes until cleared by military personnel."

Within minutes, headlights flooded the coastal arterials. Buses, military trucks, civilian vehicles, even mopeds flowed toward the central hills. Police directed traffic at intersections, joined by reservists and civil defense volunteers wearing reflective vests and surgical masks.

There was fear - yes.

But not chaos.

In the Zhongshan District, an elderly woman locked her apartment with trembling hands while her grandson helped her into a raincoat. In Tamsui, a noodle shop owner packed three children into the back of a flatbed truck already carrying strangers. People ran - but they *ran in the same direction*. The drills, the planning, the quiet dread of decades had done their work.

Taipei *moved*.

Beneath the Presidential Office Building, the Joint Chiefs were already in the secure command bunker, coordinating with the air force and naval signals corps. Over the wall of monitors, a digital countdown glowed:

**EST. TIME TO WEAPONS RANGE: 67 MINUTES**

General Tsai stood with his arms folded, jaw tight.

> "Civilian evacuation is proceeding at pace. We're at 34% displacement from red zones."

> "Any update from Yokosuka?"

> "They're in motion. Fighters are already in the air. The ships are running intercept."

> "And us?"

> "SAM batteries in the mountains are live. We're prepared to light the sky if they breach."

Tsai nodded, though his eyes remained on the timer.

In the heart of the capital, a soldier held up a hand to stop a flow of foot traffic crossing a plaza, motioning them toward an alternate route. A small girl in her mother's arms looked back toward the harbor.

There was nothing on the water yet.

Just the wind.

And the sirens.

### Washington D.C. – The White House, Situation Room

*08:12 EDT*

The door to the Situation Room slammed shut as President Donald J. Trump, flanked by Vice President J.D. Vance and National Security Advisor Rex Langford, entered with the slow, sauntering gait of a man still deciding whether this warranted his full attention.

> "Alright, what's this now? I was supposed to be on the phone with *Fox & Friends* in ten," Trump muttered, adjusting his tie without looking.

Langford didn't wait.

> "Mr. President, at 20:03 local time, five Chinese naval vessels left port without orders from Beijing. One of them is the *Haiyangshan*. They're en route to Taipei - strike trajectory, ETA just over an hour. Taiwan has activated civilian evacuation protocols. Seventh Fleet's already in motion, Kadena scrambled fighters."

Trump squinted, eyes darting between the screens showing satellite imagery, overlaid trajectories, and a timer counting down to estimated weapons range.

> "So they're rogue? Like, not China's orders?"

> "Correct. Beijing has *disavowed* them. Publicly. They even broadcast a kill authorization on open channels to stop them."

> "So China's saying *they* didn't do it," Trump said, leaning back slightly. "But we're believing them now?"

> "Sir, the message was authentic and corroborated by SIGINT. The Chinese are panicking. They want us to understand this isn't an attack from Beijing."

J.D. Vance cleared his throat, arms crossed tightly as he studied the telemetry.

> "The real question is whether they're going to fire before anyone can stop them. And if Taipei gets hit, *no one* is going to care whether China ordered it or not. That city goes up and the world hears ‘China attacked Taiwan.' No amount of cleanup is going to fix that."

Trump made a face like someone just mentioned broccoli.

> "Yeah, well, I don't want to jump into this. I mean, we don't even know what their endgame is. Why should we get dragged in over five boats that China can't keep on a leash?"

Langford tried to keep his tone neutral.

> "Because we *already are*, Mr. President. Our fighters are airborne. 7th Fleet is repositioning. Commanders followed standing directives to assist Taiwan in the event of a hostile naval approach."

> "So you're saying it's happening *without* me saying go?"

> "Yes, sir. But we can *formalize* the support package - enhance our regional posture, push the legislative envelope - "

> "Let's not get carried away," Trump said, holding up a hand. "I don't like Taiwan being hit, obviously. Nobody wants that. But we're not putting boots on the ground for some *rogue admirals with a death wish*. Not unless there's a reason the American people understand."

Vance leaned forward, lowering his voice just enough to cut through the ambient noise.

> "Sir, if those ships open fire and we don't respond, we *lose Japan*. We lose Korea. We lose the Pacific Rim. They'll all turn inward and say we blinked. That'll cost more than a thousand missiles."

Trump frowned, but he didn't argue. He looked back at the screen where the *Haiyangshan*'s projected course curved ever closer to the Taiwanese coast.

> "Well, tell our guys to handle it carefully. Carefully. Last thing I need is CNN screaming ‘World War Three' again."

Langford didn't nod, didn't speak. Just picked up the secure line and gave the unambiguous go-ahead:

> "Maintain intercept trajectory. ROE remains green. Contain - if possible. Eliminate - if necessary."

### Taipei – Tamsui Fishing Harbor – CCTV Feed

*2129 TST*

The grainy, infrared-filtered view from the pole-mounted CCTV camera captured little but rippling water and sodium-lit dockside haze. The system, old but well-maintained, had been motion-flagged only once in the last six months - by a curious stray dog.

Tonight, it flagged five.

From beneath the dark water of the Tamsui River estuary, shapes broke the surface like breaching whales - silent, deliberate, impossibly smooth.

Landmates.

The first clambered from the water with startling grace, metal feet clinking against wet concrete. The others followed in perfect unison, surfacing in formation as if they'd practiced this exact emergence a hundred times. Their armor was matte black, not reflective, but the harbor lights traced angular silhouettes, shoulder cannons dormant, twin optic arrays glowing faintly under the shadows of their brows.

One by one, they moved into firing posture.

Hands to the ground. One knee down. Back-mounted weapon systems rising silently, spinal rails telescoping upward, locking with audible mechanical finality.

Five barrels.

Five targets.

The *Haiyangshan*, *Lakan*, *Feiya*, *Shezen*, *Baizou* - still 60 kilometers out, fast approaching. Their missiles were warming, hatches already beginning to open. Sensors locked to landward. Targeting was underway.

The Landmates didn't move.

Didn't *have* to.

Their heads swiveled in sync, tracking the ships just over the radar horizon. They had already made their decision.

And now, they waited.

High above, contrails etched the night sky like bleeding chalk. F-15s from the 44th and 67th screamed in from the northeast, their burners alight, closing hard. But they were still outside the arc. Still *seconds too far*.

Every moment counted.

From the harbor's CCTV, there was no sound - only the ghostly ballet of machines preparing for war, framed by a flickering timestamp and the distant hum of red warning lights reflected in water.

Taipei held its breath.

### East of Taiwan – Aboard *Haiyangshan*

*2131 TST*

The red lights on the bridge flickered with each shockwave of the launch tubes.

> "VLS 1 through 12 away - missiles in the air!"

> "Lakan and Shezen have joined the strike. Confirming full offensive spread - pattern is saturation, wide impact grid across northern Taipei."

Captain Lu stood at the forward console, hands gripping the rail, face grim with certainty. There was no ceremony now. No further orders. The plan was already in motion.

On the main display, the arcing trails of YJ-18s and modified DF-16 ship-launched variants lit up in a crescent over the dark sea, graceful in their acceleration - if you didn't know what they carried.

> "Thirty-one seconds to terminal arc," a fire control officer noted, tone mechanical.

Behind them, the *Feiya* and *Baizou* fired in sequence, staggered only to avoid interception overlap. Five ships. Dozens of warheads. *One goal.*

### Sky Above – F-15 Formation

*2131 TST*

Captain Ellie Morse gritted her teeth as the tactical overlays exploded with red.

> "They're firing - *multiple birds in the air* - Jesus, they're committing to the strike!"

Her HUD painted the sky with rising trails of infrared: warheads too far gone for interception at this distance. She keyed her comm.

> "All flights, weapons range ETA still sixty seconds - push to the deck, we have to get below radar shadow - "

Then: *Three new blips.*

Fast.

No transponders. High-angle intercept. Climbing *past* them and doubling back like falcons out of the sun. Morse's systems chirped in alarm as the ghost contacts approached - marked as *unknown* and accelerating *beyond known profiles*.

> "Flight, we've got incoming unknowns - possible ambush from northeast vector - brace for merge!"

She was halfway through selecting defensive ECM modes when one of the bogeys suddenly flared alongside her canopy, dipping gracefully into formation beside her.

Jet black. Angular. A silhouette that *shouldn't exist*. No markings other than a stylized wireframe globe flanked by laurels and two broken swords - *the same one spotted on the Landmates*.

The shock froze her brain - until a calm, unmistakably female voice broke into the squadron's encrypted frequency.

> "Sorry we're late," the voice drawled in a clear, syrupy Texas accent. "You look like you could use a hand. Leave the missiles to us, go straight for the ships."

Morse's blood ran cold.

The voice had *a smile in it*. Casual. Relaxed. Like they were talking about the weather instead of a missile barrage that could kill them all. These pilots - whoever they were - sounded like they did this every Tuesday.

> "Say again, unknown?"

But the planes were already peeling off with the kind of fluid precision that only came from countless hours of real combat. No hesitation. No fear. Just terrifying competence wrapped in a friendly drawl.

The IR overlays flared white as intercepts began.

Dozens of hostile missiles - *each* tagged for destruction.

Morse exhaled, realizing her knuckles were white on the stick.

> "Alright, Bats," she muttered, recovering. "Looks like angels are on overwatch. We hit those bastards on the water - hard."

Fifteen seconds to weapons range.

Taipei still had a chance.

### Sky Above the Strait – Intercept Corridor

*2132 TST*

The Talons broke formation like a flock of ravens in a dance only they knew.

Morse saw the undersides fold open and a round rack emerge. It rotated a few stops, and with a sharp, momentary *flash* something fast streaked outward into the night.

Each Talon launched *a single warhead*. Then seconds later, with no ceremony, they *detonated* mid-path - just ahead of the swarm.

The sky caught fire, like a stage out of a Touhou game.

A lattice of flashpoints burst in a geometric bloom, too fast and too dense to track individually. The explosions didn't ripple; they *snapped* in succession, a chain-reaction of saturation blasts so tight they seemed orchestrated.

To the naked eye from the deck of an F-15, it was like watching a tapestry unravel - warheads splitting apart mid-arc, shredded by expanding shockwaves of superheated air and burning metal.

Every. Single. Missile. Gone.

Captain Morse stared through her HUD, which stuttered as the data feed tried - and failed - to keep up with what had just happened.

> "What the hell *was* that?" one of her wingmen muttered.

> "Counter-saturation package?" someone else guessed.

> "That wasn't a package. That was *surgical decapitation*."

She didn't respond. Her attention snapped forward.

The sea ahead shimmered with faint starlight - and five silhouettes emerged from the horizon.

### Tamsui Fishing Harbor – Coastal Defense Feed

*2133 TST*

The Landmates moved in unison, like dancers rehearsed to perfection.

Still braced on one knee, they lifted their heads toward the horizon.

There was no visible light - no red designator this time.

But to the F-15s overhead, their threat signature lit the sky.

> "Infrared lock - five beams, five ships," Morse confirmed. "They're painting the bridges."

All five Landmates had elevated their spinal mounts. Their sensors were narrow and silent, invisible to the human eye - but to the fighters and their EWAR suites, it was like five spotlights converging through fog.

On the *Haiyangshan*, *Lakan*, *Feiya*, *Shezen*, and *Baizou* - each vessel's bridge now basked in a deathly glow only seen through heat.

> "Jesus," Morse whispered. "They're *marking targets*."

No missiles rose yet.

But everyone - from the rogue captains to the brass in Washington - now knew:

Strike One had failed.

And the counterstrike was *already watching*.

### Tamsui Fishing Harbor – Coastal Defense Feed

*2133 TST*

The Landmates moved with mechanical stillness for just one more breath - then fired.

All five back-mounted weapons discharged in the same instant.

There was no thunderclap, no conventional roar of powder and flame. What came instead was *pressure* - a crushing, concussive *shockwave* that slammed through the harbor like a sudden shift in gravity. Light poles nearby sparked violently, arcs of blue-white electricity leaping from the barrels to the concrete, and water along the quay *lifted* as if struck from beneath by invisible fists.

A jagged web of static burst across the coastal CCTV feed. For three full seconds, the image stuttered into ghosted frames and white streaks.

From the vantage point of the incoming F-15s, five incandescent streaks cut across the sea like lightning bolts frozen in flight, fired low and dead-straight - barely skimming above the surface tension of the waves.

Then, five ships bloomed fire at once.

The *Haiyangshan* went first - its bridge *vanished*, replaced by a geyser of shattered armor, vapor, and structural debris. A heartbeat later, the *Lakan*'s command tower cracked in half like brittle glass, followed immediately by *Feiya*, *Shezen*, and *Baizou*, each torn open as if a fist of god had punched straight through their command cores.

No trails. No delayed impact. No sound - *until* the wavefronts hit the coast seconds later, a delayed percussion that rattled windows all the way to central Taipei.

> "*Bridges are gone,*" Morse reported, eyes wide. "All five. God almighty, they hit *only* the bridges - every one of them. One shot per target."

Below, the Landmates had already lowered their weapons and begun to rise.

Unhurried. Silent.

The final frame from the CCTV camera showed one of them stepping off the edge of the wharf and walking back into the black water, joints hissing softly from dissipated heat.

They had come.

They had fired.

And now, they were gone.

### Taiwan Strait – *Haiyangshan* Bridge

*2133 TST*

Captain Lu saw the intercept display go dark and understood immediately.

One second, he stood watching the plotting board as his missiles disappeared - not one by one, but all at once, atomized by a precision that defied every tactical doctrine he'd ever studied.

His XO was mid-sentence:

> "They're burning in, I repeat, all incoming munitions have been -"

"Eliminated," Lu finished quietly. "All of them."

He straightened slowly, his hands still gripping the edge of the plotting table. Around him, the bridge crew stared at their displays in stunned silence. Twenty-four missiles, fired from maximum range with full saturation protocols. Gone in less than three seconds.

Lu had expected this. Deep down, he'd known from the moment they'd fired that their weapons would never reach Taipei. But watching the confirmation still felt like a blade twisting in his chest.

He pulled his grandfather's photograph from his uniform pocket, studying the young face in faded sepia. Three generations of Lu men, and he would be the one remembered as a traitor. History would not understand. History rarely did.

"Sir," his sensor operator called out, voice tight with professional alarm. "I'm detecting infrared designators. Five sources. Coastal emitters."

Lu didn't look up from the photograph. "Range to targets?"

"Fourteen point seven kilometers. Direct bearing on our position."

So close. They'd let his ships come so close before showing their hand. A professional courtesy, perhaps - or simple confidence.

"Time to impact?"

"Sir, I'm not detecting any launch signatures -"

Lu tucked the photograph back into his pocket and turned to face his crew. Young men and women who had followed him into this, trusting in his judgment, his competence, his certainty. They deserved better than to die confused.

"Attention," he announced, his voice carrying the same steady authority that had commanded this bridge for three years. "What comes next is not failure. It is the price of refusing to surrender Chinese sovereignty to foreign powers."

His XO stared at him. "Captain?"

Lu looked once more through the forward windows. Somewhere out there in the darkness, entities beyond his understanding were taking aim. Their weapons would be precise. Professional. He found himself oddly grateful for that.

"Tell the crew," he said quietly. "We served with honor. We chose -"

The impact came from directly ahead - not an explosion, but a *hammer blow* that crushed the bridge superstructure like an eggshell. In his final moment, Lu felt a strange peace. He had stared into the abyss of China's obsolescence and refused to blink.

His grandfather would have understood.

### Aboard *Lakan* – Combat Information Center

*2133 TST*

In *Lakan*'s CIC, the tactical officer had just raised her head to report an unknown infrared designator source when the room lit up - *from within*.

The ceiling *imploded*, collapsing inwards in a blinding flash of white and steel, and then the world *vanished*. Consoles, chairs, wiring - every object in the space was crushed into vaporized wreckage by a hypersonic penetrator that entered cleanly through the deck and left nothing of the command team in its wake.

### Aboard *Feiya*, *Shezen*, *Baizou*

*2133 TST*

Across all three ships, it was the same.

No radar lock. No acoustic cue. No telltale arc across the horizon.

One instant, there was command. The next, only chaos - crimson light, shearing metal, sirens that never got the chance to sound. Bulkheads folded inwards as if a giant hand had punched through them at orbital velocity. Whole decks caved.

The bridges *ceased to exist*.

Not jammed. Not suppressed. *Erased*.

The remaining crew on each vessel staggered, disoriented, stumbling through corridors suddenly lit only by backup lights and emergency klaxons, most not even aware that their command structure had just ceased to exist.

In less than two seconds, five ships had been decapitated with terrifying precision.

They had launched a war.

And in a heartbeat, they'd been shown what power *actually* looked like.

### Above Taipei – Combat Airspace

*2134 TST*

> "All right," the voice drawled across squad comms, calm as ever. "Bridges are off. They're sitting ducks. *Take 'em to church.*"

Captain Ellie Morse didn't respond - she was too busy adjusting her jaw back into place.

Whoever the pilot was, she was still grinning. You could *hear* it.

Below, the five rogue vessels lay adrift, barely afloat. Smoke trailed from the torn remnants of their command decks. Communications were dead, radar systems fried, and whatever chain of command they had left had been blown sky-high in less time than it took to fire a flare.

They weren't ships anymore.

They were targets.

> "You heard her," Morse keyed up. "All wings, take attack vectors. Hit the hulls - aim for propulsion and weapons. Let's clean this up."

Even as she spoke, her gaze tracked upward, drawn to the three black aircraft that had begun a slow, circling pattern above Taipei. They weren't racing anymore. No intercepts, no urgency.

They were *watching*.

And that's when Morse saw it.

The broad delta wings - sleek, jagged, nearly seamless - *shifted*.

At first it was subtle. Then it wasn't.

With smooth mechanical elegance, the outer third of each wingtip pivoted forward, locking into a forward-swept configuration. The lines of the airframe adjusted around the transformation, control surfaces compensating automatically. They didn't shudder. They didn't jolt.

They adapted.

> "Holy hell..." Morse whispered. "They're morphing."

> "Say again?" a pilot beside her asked.

> "The wings. Look at their wings. Forward sweep - *variable geometry*. I didn't even think that was feasible at supersonic speeds."

The three fighters banked slowly in unison, like predators at rest.

They'd done their job.

Now it was the F-15s' turn.

### Above the Strait – Target Group "Disavowed"

*2136 TST*

Missiles streaked low over the waves, carving clean contrails through the black air.

From every angle, the F-15s of the 44th and 67th squadrons poured in fire.

AGM-88 HARMs slammed into the radar dishes still mounted on *Feiya* and *Shezen*, reducing their already smoldering decks to twisted scrap. On *Baizou*, a deck-mounted CIWS tried to track one of the inbound birds - but was already slag by the time the fire control system activated.

Engines went next.

Mavericks and smart glide bombs turned propulsion compartments into fountains of flame and turbine shrapnel. Each impact was deliberate, restrained. They weren't trying to sink the vessels - just cut their legs off. Let the ocean do the rest.

> "Targets two and four disabled. Zero return fire. These ships are done," one pilot confirmed over comms.

> "Three's got flame out the screws. Rudder's floating separately."

Captain Ellie Morse released her last missile and watched it hammer into *Lakan*'s exposed stern, blowing a half-moon crater into the deck. Secondary explosions blossomed around the impact as fuel lines cooked off.

Her HUD dimmed slightly in the afterglow.

That's when she looked up.

The three black aircraft still circled above Taipei, just outside the heart of the kill zone. Smooth arcs. No rush. No chatter. Not even visible weapon bays anymore - only their newly swept-forward wings catching moonlight in long, predatory glints.

They were just *watching*.

Morse adjusted in her seat and flicked her eyes upward again, inexplicably uneasy.

> "Why do I feel like I'm being graded...?" she muttered, mostly to herself.

No one answered.

But one of the black planes banked slightly - just enough to let the canopy reflect starlight.

Like it *had* heard her.

Like it *agreed*.

### Above the Strait – Holding Pattern

*2140 TST*

The chaos below had settled into smoke and silence. Five shattered hulls drifted dead in the water, listing gently in the waves like the carcasses of fallen leviathans.

Above them, eight F-15s joined the three black aircraft in a loose, circling pattern high above the strike zone. The battlefield was pacified. For now.

Captain Ellie Morse glanced at her MFDs, then nudged her stick into formation, keeping her fighter tight with the others. She exhaled slowly, then keyed her transmitter.

> "Uh... unidentified aircraft, this is Captain Ellie Morse, United States 44th Fighter Squadron. Thank you? I guess, for your assistance?"

A pause.

> "We have ships about three hours out and closing, to secure the area. Do you need to land or refuel?"

There was a moment of static. Then the reply came, crisp and warm, laced with that easygoing Texas twang.

> "Appreciate the offer, Captain, but we're good. We'll stay here until your friends arrive - just to be on the safe side."

The voice had the same calm playfulness as before, like someone tipping their hat rather than confirming air superiority. Then, a pause.

> "What did you think of our little firework? Quite a show the *Inferno* can put on, yes?"

Morse blinked.

> *Inferno?*

She scanned her instruments. No transponders, no IDs, no emissions that made sense. But whoever was flying those things had a name for their guns - and *pride* in them.

She stared at the three aircraft still circling overhead, one of which now trailed faint blue light from its engines like the afterglow of something nuclear.

> "That what you call it? *Inferno*?" she asked, not expecting a reply.

> "Yup," the voice came back cheerfully. "She don't speak softly, but she sure as hell carries a big stick."

And with that, the black fighters resumed their quiet arc above the ruined fleet, silent sentinels watching over the wreckage they'd helped create - waiting, still, just in case.

### Yokosuka Naval Base – Operations Command

*1847 JST*

The command floor was still buzzing. Phones trilled, printers spat classified briefs onto trays, and every monitor in the room flickered with live feeds from the Taiwan Strait - thermal overlays, radar returns, gun-camera footage, infrared sweeps.

Rear Admiral Thomas Vance stood at the center, arms crossed, staring at the large digital display showing the five drifting silhouettes of *Haiyangshan*, *Lakan*, *Feiya*, *Shezen*, and *Baizou*. None of them had propulsion. None of them had functioning bridges. Most were still on fire.

> "All right," Vance said, voice low. "Who gets the credit?"

A few officers glanced at one another. It was Commander Maeda, intelligence liaison, who finally answered.

> "Depends on who you ask, sir. 44th and 67th delivered the final blows - disabled propulsion, weapons, cleaned up the wrecks."

She tapped a few keys, bringing up another overlay.

> "But the uh… *black planes* - whatever they are - intercepted the missile salvo. Perfectly. Every single one. And we're not even sure *who* made the bridges explode. There's no heat signature before impact. No flash. Just… obliteration. We're guessing there was someone else involved."

Vance exhaled through his nose and rubbed his temple.

> "So they show up out of nowhere, wipe a rogue task force off the board and hand us the aftermath," he muttered. "Then they hang around just to let us know they could've done more."

No one disagreed.

The footage being reviewed by analysts in the side room showed those black planes flying lazy orbits above the combat zone - unhurried, silent, *watching*. Their restraint was almost more unnerving than their firepower. The implication wasn't subtle.

They weren't here for glory.

They were here for *control*.

### Beijing – Central Military Commission Compound

*1847 CST*

The room was silent except for the low whir of overhead ventilation and the rapid tapping of a single pair of fingers on a keyboard.

Then the door creaked open, and an aide stepped in, clutching a phone to his ear with a kind of grim reverence. His expression was pale, eyes wide - not quite disbelief, but something close.

> "Fuzhou confirms," he said, voice level but strained. "All five ships destroyed. Bridge strikes were instantaneous. No missile impacts on Taipei. Zero casualties reported ashore."

The ministers around the long table leaned in. One of the generals let out a low breath, part relief, part realization.

> "They *stopped* it…" someone murmured.

No one said *who*.

The aide lowered the phone slowly, sliding it into his coat pocket as if it might burn him.

> "Radar post says they saw the black planes arrive. They have no idea where from. Just that they were ‘there' one moment, and the missile barrage began dying the next. The five ships - " he hesitated, " - had no time to respond."

Across the room, one of the civilian aides at the far end had already opened a blank statement draft on his laptop. The top line read:
**Public Notice – Disavowal of Unauthorized Naval Action**

Another aide leaned over his shoulder, murmuring edits.

> "Frame it as rogue actors. Clarify that the vessels acted without Party authorization. Express regret, reaffirm commitment to cross-strait peace and regional dialogue..."

> "And make it *fast*," someone else snapped. "Every minute we delay, we give them an excuse to escalate. Or worse, *show up again*."

The director of the Propaganda Bureau glanced down at his pen, spinning it slowly between his fingers.

> "We're not writing a defense," he said flatly. "We're writing an apology and a *thank-you note*."

The dread in the room was like pressure in the air - too thick for relief, too early for grief.

Because none of them believed this was the end.

It was just the moment they'd been allowed to *survive*.

### White House – Situation Room

*0749 EDT*

The room was cooler than usual. Silent, too - save for the soft murmur of terminals and the occasional rustle of paper as aides passed fresh updates down the table. Flat screens along the walls were showing thermal footage from the Taiwan Strait, now largely smoke and debris. The tactical overlay traced out five vessel silhouettes, all dead in the water.

President Trump leaned back in his chair, arms crossed, eyes locked on one of the screens without really seeing it.

> "So we stopped it?"

There was a short pause. General Watkins, sitting nearest, cleared his throat.

> "Yes, and no, Mr. President. *Someone* stopped it, but that wasn't us."

He tapped a tablet twice, flicking an image to the main display - three dark aircraft in formation over Taipei, silhouetted in infrared.

> "Our F-15s out of Kadena delivered the final blows - disabled propulsion, neutralized remaining weapons - but by the time they arrived, something else had already taken the bridges clean off the ships. Instantaneous strikes. No known ordinance."

Trump furrowed his brow, squinting at the display.

> "So what - space lasers? Drones? You're saying we don't know?"

Watkins gave a half-shrug. "Military intelligence has no good guesses at this time, sir."

Another general slid a fresh report forward. "Details are still unclear, Mr. President, but one of the pilots out of Kadena mentioned an unknown but highly effective weapon the unidentified pilots referred to as *Inferno*."

That drew murmurs from a few of the civilian aides.

> "*Inferno*," Trump repeated, as if tasting the word. "Sounds like a Marvel thing. Is that what they're calling these guys now?"

No one answered.

The term *black planes* floated across one of the analyst memos on the table, underlined three times.

But no names. No country. No flags.

Just fire, silence - and *precision*.

### Above the Strait – Patrol Orbit

*0332 TST*

The sea below was a lattice of ruin and drifting metal. Even hours later, fires still licked along the shattered ribs of *Feiya* and *Baizou*. The F-15s of the 44th and 67th squadrons had settled into a high, looping orbit over the wrecks, keeping watch while surface elements raced to secure the site.

They weren't alone.

The three black aircraft - sleek, predatory, impossibly quiet - had remained in tight formation just beneath the upper cloud deck, circling slowly, never once breaking rhythm.

It didn't take long for the boredom to set in.

> "Sooo…" Captain Ellie Morse finally radioed, stretching out the word with a touch of mischief, "you guys got a callsign? Designator? We can't just keep calling you ‘Black Planes' here…"

For a moment, only the soft hiss of open airwaves answered. Then the familiar Texan voice crackled in.

> "You can call us *Shield flight*, yeah. I'm Shield One, the Aussie here is Shield Two, and he's Shield Three there."

A pause. Then a new voice chimed in, amused and unmistakably Australian.

> "Cheers, Captain. Thought you'd never ask."

> "Charmed," came the third voice, clipped and crisp, like a Royal Air Force officer doing a caricature of himself. "Though I must admit, ‘Black Planes' had a nice mystique to it. Bit pulp, but dignified."

The American pilots chuckled across the channel. Morse tilted her head toward the sleek jet idling a few hundred meters off her left wing.

> "So what *are* those planes you're flying?" she asked, unable to resist. "They look nothing like we've ever seen…"

The Aussie - Shield Two - answered first.

> "It's called the *Talon*, mate. And yeah, I bet it's scary, for a good reason."

Then came the grin, audible even through static:

> "Don't worry, though. Right now, you're safer here than pretty much anywhere else. Including your bedroom."

Morse raised an eyebrow in her cockpit and muttered under her breath, "Well that's comforting..."

But it *was*.

Because whatever the hell these *Talons* were - whatever organization *Shield Flight* belonged to - they weren't flying hostile. And when things had gone bad tonight, they hadn't hesitated.

They'd *acted*.

That was more than most.

### Taiwan Strait – Surface Action Group Arrival

*0405 TST*

The radar tracks drew nearer as the AEGIS cruiser *USS Gettysburg* and the guided-missile destroyer *USS John Paul Jones* broke from formation and slowed to flank speed, their wakes slicing clean through the ash-slicked sea. The battered hulks of the five rogue Chinese warships loomed in the distance, half-sunk and smoldering under the waning stars.

Above them, the orbiting fighters peeled off slightly to make room.

> "Shield Flight, this is Gettysburg Actual," came the voice over the open frequency. "We have operational control of the battlespace. You are clear to depart or remain as observers. Appreciate the cover."

> "Copy that, Gettysburg," Shield One's Texan drawl returned. "You've got the stick. We'll keep an eye from upstairs a little longer, just in case the sea gets rowdy."

Down on the *John Paul Jones*, Commander Lucero stood with a small inspection team near the bow, watching through binoculars as a pair of RHIBs cautiously circled the drifting corpse of the *Haiyangshan*. The once-imposing destroyer's hull was blackened and sagging near midships - but it was the bridge that held their attention.

Even from a distance, it looked *wrong*.

The tower wasn't just destroyed - it had been *excised*. A single clean wound ran across the structure, the kind no missile or shell in the US inventory could produce. It looked less like it had exploded, and more like something had *punched through it* with the speed of a railgun and the precision of a scalpel.

> "Look at that," one of the lieutenants muttered beside Lucero, raising a scope. "No internal blast. No shrapnel burst. Just vaporized *clean through*."

Lucero adjusted his own view and nodded slowly. Even the internal bulkheads visible through the sheared openings were glassy and curled, *melted* at the edges rather than shattered.

> "Goddamn… it looks like lightning hit it point-blank. Except lightning doesn't punch through naval armor."

Another officer turned, glancing up at the sky where the black planes still orbited like hawks.

> "That wasn't lightning," he said softly. "That was something else. Something new."

Lucero didn't answer.

He didn't have to.

### Taiwan Strait – Above the Wrecks

*0413 TST*

With the Gettysburg and John Paul Jones now on station, the battle space had shifted from chaos to cleanup. Searchlights swept over the smoking husks below, RHIBs buzzed across the waves, and the last echoes of battle faded into the hiss of wind and water.

Overhead, *Shield Flight* maintained its silent vigil - three obsidian silhouettes against the dark sky, haloed faintly by the cityglow of Taipei.

Then, on the common channel:

> "All y'all can take it from here, yeah?" drawled Shield One. "It's time for us to go back home."

> "It was fun flying with you all! Cheers, mates!" added Shield Two, ever the cheerful Aussie.

> "Until next time, ladies and gentlemen," came Shield Three, smooth and polite as ever.

The three Talons banked in unison and began to climb.

There was no roar, no thunder - only a low *whine* that tickled at the edges of audibility. Their exhaust nozzles flared to brilliant *blue*, the color of burning stars, and then - 

They *launched*.

The climb wasn't fast - it was *instant*. One moment they were there, sleek and predatory in formation. The next, they were spearing skyward in tight formation, vanishing into the black above with a speed that outran even radar.

Captain Ellie Morse watched the tracks blink out on her scope, disappearing barely thirty seconds after the climb began.

> "Well," she muttered to herself, "that's one way to make an exit…"

No one responded on the channel.

The sky above Taiwan was empty once again.

### Beijing – Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Hall

*0600 CST*

The hall was sterile, almost funereal in tone. A lone podium stood beneath the golden insignia of the People's Republic, flanked by red flags and unmoving guards. Cameras from around the world were already broadcasting live as the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stepped forward. Her face was composed, voice steady - but the tension in her knuckles as she gripped the edge of the lectern betrayed what the polished statement would not.

> "Last night, a rogue element within the People's Liberation Army Navy - comprised of five vessels under the leadership of the former captain of the *Haiyangshan* - violated standing orders and initiated an unauthorized movement toward the Taiwan Strait."

There was a pause, a practiced breath.

> "These actions do not represent the will of the Central Military Commission or the People's Republic of China. The rogue fleet was engaged and neutralized before it could carry out hostile acts. We are grateful for the timely intervention of the United States Seventh Fleet, as well as… all parties involved in the operation."

The phrasing wasn't missed by a single analyst watching.

> "The People's Republic will launch a full investigation into the breach of command and reassert its commitment to regional peace and stability. We extend our sincere condolences to the families of the crews involved, and we express our appreciation to the international forces who ensured the safety of civilian populations in the region."

She did not name the Talons. She didn't have to.

Across the world, the reactions to the statement were immediate - and uneasy.

In Berlin, Brussels, Canberra, and Tokyo, military attachés stared at their screens in disbelief. The Chinese government had just thanked *unknown actors* for helping the Americans stop their own navy - something that would have been unthinkable only a month prior.

There was no defiance, no threats of retaliation. Just *gratitude*. Meek, uneasy, thinly veiled *fear*.

In Washington, one senior diplomat muttered over his morning coffee:

> "Jesus… they sound like someone just walked through their nightmares and left a calling card."

And no one could quite argue otherwise.

### CNN Breaking News Segment

*0902 EST – Atlanta Headquarters*

The screen flashed red.

**BREAKING NEWS** blared across the lower third, and the camera cut to studio anchor *Melissa Harrow*, seated tensely behind her desk, papers in hand, earpiece pressed tight.

> "Good morning. We are following breaking developments out of East Asia this hour, where an extraordinary event has just unfolded in the Taiwan Strait."

Behind her, satellite imagery of the region lit up the screen, overlaid with uncertain red circles and streaks. There were no videos yet - just speculation, intercepted comms, and words exchanged behind closed doors.

> "According to U.S. and Taiwanese defense officials, a group of five rogue Chinese naval vessels - believed to have broken from official command - were en route to Taipei in what sources describe as an *unauthorized and hostile maneuver*."

A beat. She tapped the earpiece again.

> "We can now confirm that all five ships have been *destroyed at sea*… not by U.S. forces, but by what officials are describing only as an ‘unknown force.'"

The words hung in the air like a weight.

> "While American fighter jets from Kadena Air Base were dispatched to intercept, it appears a third party intervened - using highly advanced aircraft and what may have been precision long-range weapons. These aircraft, still unidentified, reportedly disabled the rogue fleet before American fighters even arrived on station."

Behind her, the screen showed a freeze-frame of one of the now-familiar *black planes* - a silhouette from earlier footage in the Gaza Strip, juxtaposed with a rendering of the destroyed bridge of the *Haiyangshan*.

> "Chinese officials have issued a rare statement disavowing the fleet and expressing thanks to ‘all parties' involved in stopping the attack - marking a dramatic shift in tone from previous tensions."

She looked directly into the camera now.

> "There is *no footage* of the intercept at this time. All we have are descriptions: aircraft that appeared suddenly, deployed advanced munitions, and departed at speeds no current fighter can match. One military source, speaking anonymously, simply called it ‘a show of force from someone we don't understand yet.'"

The lower third updated again:
**UNKNOWN FORCE DESTROYS ROGUE FLEET – CHINESE GOVERNMENT THANKS U.S. & OTHERS**

Melissa exhaled softly and shuffled the next page into view.

> "We'll be staying with this story as it develops. For now - something just changed in the Strait. And the world is trying to figure out who changed it."

The screen faded to a slow pan over burning shipwrecks - taken by a Taiwanese Coast Guard drone still circling the carnage.

And somewhere above, unseen, the sky was watching.

## Chapter 5: Going Viral

### Tamsui Fishing Harbor, Taipei

*0847 TST*

The morning air still carried the faint acrid smell of burnt metal and electrical discharge, but the sirens had finally stopped. Along the harbor, orange cones and yellow tape marked where emergency crews had swept for debris - fragments of concrete and twisted metal that had been blasted loose when the Landmates fired their impossible weapons into the night.

Chen Wei-Ming balanced on a stepladder, adjusting the angle of the CCTV camera mounted above his uncle's bait shop. At seventeen, he was supposed to be in school, but Uncle Chen had called him at dawn with urgent work - half the harbor's security cameras had been knocked offline by the electromagnetic pulse, and the insurance company wanted footage of any damage.

Wei-Ming didn't mind skipping classes. This was more interesting than calculus.

> "Does this one still work?" he called down to his uncle, who was sweeping glass from the shop's front window.

> "Check the timestamp. If it recorded through the night, we're lucky."

Wei-Ming connected his laptop to the camera's storage unit and scrolled through the footage. Most of it was routine - empty docks, the occasional fishing boat, seagulls. Then he hit 21:33:00 and nearly fell off the ladder.

> "Uncle," he said quietly. "Uncle, you need to see this."

The timestamp read 21:33:12 when the water at the end of the pier *moved*. Not waves - something rising from beneath. Wei-Ming held his breath as a dark shape broke the surface, water cascading off angular armor plating. Then another. Then three more.

The Landmates emerged like mechanical gods, each movement precise and deliberate. Wei-Ming had seen the Gaza footage - everyone had - but this was different. This was *here*. This was real.

He watched, transfixed, as they took position with military precision. The spinal weapons rose in perfect synchronization. Then came the moment that made his hands shake on the laptop: five brilliant flashes of light, followed immediately by the violent electrical arcing that had knocked out half the harbor's electronics.

> "Aiya..." his uncle breathed over his shoulder. "They were *here*. Right here."

Wei-Ming was already thinking. This wasn't just amazing - this was *gold*. Better than Gaza, because this showed them in action. Better than any news report, because this was raw, unfiltered, *authentic*.

He scrubbed back to the emergence and started clipping.

### Tamsui Fishing Harbor

*0923 TST*

Wei-Ming's editing setup was nothing fancy - just his gaming laptop and some pirated video software - but he knew what made content viral. He'd been running a tech review channel for two years, small but growing. This was going to change everything.

He trimmed the clip to ninety seconds, starting with the first Landmate breaking the surface. Slow motion for the emergence - that was pure cinema. Real-time for the positioning sequence to show their inhuman coordination. Then slow motion again for the firing, with the electrical effects clearly visible as they arced between metal surfaces.

For the final touch, he overlaid the timestamp and location data. Authenticity was everything.

> "臥槽..." he muttered, watching the preview. Even he was getting chills.

He uploaded to Weibo first - his home turf, 40,000 followers who trusted his tech content. The caption was simple: "LANDMATES IN ACTION - Tamsui Harbor, last night. Real footage, real weapons. #Landmates #Taiwan #你相信嗎"

Then Twitter. Then TikTok. Then YouTube as a backup.

His phone buzzed with the first notification before he'd finished the uploads.

Wei-Ming stared at his phone. In ten minutes, his follower count had jumped by three thousand. The notifications were coming so fast they were just a continuous buzz.

Someone had already ripped his video and posted it to international platforms. The watermark was gone, but the footage was spreading like wildfire across Reddit, Twitter, Instagram. News aggregators were picking it up. His 40,000-follower Weibo account had just handed the world its first clear look at Landmates in combat.

His uncle appeared in the doorway, face pale.

> "Wei-Ming. There are people outside. They say they're from the government."

### Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) - Taipei Station

*0945 TST*

The video had pinged SVR's automated monitoring systems within minutes of going viral. Social media surveillance algorithms were constantly scanning for military-related content, and "Landmates" was a priority keyword after Gaza.

Station Chief Dmitri Volkov watched the footage for the third time, his expression growing darker with each viewing. He'd been in intelligence for twenty years, had seen everything from battlefield innovations to black project leaks. This was something else entirely.

> "Get me Moscow," he told his deputy. "Priority channel. And find our best weapons analyst."

The secure line crackled to life within minutes.

> "This is Colonel Petrov, Technical Analysis Division. I've seen the footage."

Volkov leaned forward. "Your assessment?"

> "The electromagnetic discharge patterns are unmistakable. Those are railguns - magnetic acceleration weapons. But the engineering... Dmitri, the power requirements alone should make this impossible."

> "Explain."

> "A railgun that size, firing simultaneously with four others, would require a massive power source. The heat dissipation would melt the barrels. The recoil should have knocked them over. And look at the precision - five separate targets, fired at exactly the same moment, with perfect accuracy."

Volkov studied the frozen frame on his screen. Five mechanical figures, weapons raised, caught in the moment before they reshaped naval warfare forever.

> "Bottom line, Colonel."

> "Bottom line? Whoever built these has solved engineering problems we didn't know were solvable. Our naval defenses are obsolete. Our weapons can't match their range or penetration. And they can deploy from underwater without any infrastructure."

The line was quiet for a long moment.

> "Colonel, I need you to brief the Admiral. Full technical analysis. Threat assessment. And recommendations."

> "What kind of recommendations?"

> "How we survive if these things show up in Sevastopol."

### Russian Ministry of Defense - Moscow

*1420 MSK*

The briefing room in the Ministry's basement was sterile and windowless, lit by harsh fluorescents that made everyone look pale and tired. Admiral Kozlov sat at the head of the table, flanked by technical advisors, weapons specialists, and three physicists who'd been pulled from their laboratories that morning.

Dr. Yevgeny Marchenko, Russia's leading railgun researcher, stood at the presentation screen with the expression of a man watching his life's work rendered obsolete in ninety seconds of amateur footage.

> "Gentlemen," he began, "what you're about to see represents a technological leap of at least thirty years. Possibly fifty."

He advanced to the first frame - the Landmates emerging from the water.

> "Amphibious deployment with no visible support infrastructure. Whatever their power source, it's self-contained and waterproof. The fact that they can operate submerged suggests either revolutionary battery technology or compact fusion."

Next frame: the firing sequence.

> "The electromagnetic signature is unmistakable. These are railguns, but miniaturized beyond anything we thought possible. The projectile velocity, based on the electrical discharge, suggests near-orbital speeds. No conventional armor can withstand this."

He paused at the frame showing the electrical arcing.

> "This discharge pattern confirms everything my team has theorized about magnetic acceleration weapons. The voltage, the current flow, the heat dissipation - it's all there. Proof that railgun technology is not only feasible but deployable."

Admiral Kozlov leaned forward. "And our chances against them?"

Marchenko's laugh was hollow. "Admiral, our most advanced naval guns fire at roughly 800 meters per second. These weapons likely exceed 3,000 meters per second. At those velocities, we're not talking about conventional ballistics anymore - we're talking about *kinetic kill vehicles*. The energy transfer from a tungsten penetrator at orbital speeds... there isn't armor on Earth designed to withstand that kind of impact."

He gestured at the display showing the electrical discharge patterns.

"A conventional 130mm shell carries about 40 megajoules of kinetic energy. These railgun projectiles, at the velocities we're seeing? We're looking at *gigajoule-class* impacts. That's not a shell anymore - that's a meteor strike, delivered with surgical precision."

The room was silent except for the hum of ventilation.

Another advisor spoke up - Colonel Ruslan Petrov from Strategic Planning.

> "Admiral, we need to consider the broader implications. These units appeared in Gaza, neutralized Hamas in days. Now they've eliminated a rogue Chinese naval force in minutes. The pattern is clear."

> "Which is?"

> "They're peacekeepers. Enforcers. And they have the technology to enforce their will on anyone."

Admiral Kozlov rubbed his temples. "Ukraine?"

The words hung in the air like a death sentence.

> "If these units appear in Ukraine - on either side - the war is over," Petrov said quietly. "Our advantage in artillery, armor, air support... meaningless. They could walk from Kharkiv to Moscow and we couldn't stop them."

Dr. Marchenko nodded grimly. "Based on the Gaza deployment, a single squad pacified an entire city. A company could end a conventional war."

Another long silence.

> "Recommendations?" Kozlov asked.

Petrov opened a folder, hands steady despite the magnitude of what he was about to say.

> "Immediate strategic reassessment. We assume these forces are monitoring global conflicts. We assume they will intervene if escalation threatens regional stability. We assume our conventional military superiority is now irrelevant."

> "Are you suggesting we stand down?"

> "I'm suggesting we avoid giving them a reason to notice us."

Admiral Kozlov stared at the frozen image on the screen - five mechanical sentinels that had just rewritten the rules of warfare. In his thirty years of service, he'd seen the Soviet Navy collapse, watched NATO expand, witnessed the rise of hypersonic missiles and stealth technology.

None of it had prepared him for obsolescence.

> "Draft new operational parameters," he said finally. "All Black Sea and Pacific deployments are to avoid confrontational postures. No aggressive maneuvers. No weapons targeting of allied or neutral vessels."

> "Sir, that's essentially - "

> "That's survival, Colonel."

He stood slowly, the weight of command suddenly feeling very different.

> "Gentlemen, as of today, we are no longer the world's second-largest military power. We're a regional force, and we'd better start acting like it."

The meeting ended in silence, each man carrying the knowledge that everything they'd trained for, everything they'd built, had just been rendered quaint by ninety seconds of grainy CCTV footage.

Outside, Moscow went about its business, unaware that the balance of global power had shifted again - not through treaties or elections, but through five machines walking out of dark water with weapons that shouldn't exist.

Wei-Ming's phone had long since given up trying to display all the notifications. His laptop was struggling to load his own social media pages. Outside, three news vans had joined the government officials, and someone with a very expensive camera was trying to interview his uncle.

He'd become the most famous teenager in Taiwan overnight.

And somewhere in the depths of the internet, in classified briefing rooms and intelligence centers around the world, military analysts were watching his ninety-second clip and coming to the same conclusion the Russians had reached:

The rules had changed.

Forever.

### CNN Breaking News – Atlanta Headquarters

*2147 EST*

The red "BREAKING NEWS" banner dominated the screen as anchor Anderson Cooper leaned forward at his desk, earpiece pressed tight, papers shuffled with practiced urgency.

> "Good evening. We're following breaking developments out of Taiwan tonight, where extraordinary footage has emerged showing what appear to be the same autonomous weapons systems - known as Landmates - that made headlines during the Gaza conflict last month."

Behind him, Wei-Ming's edited footage played in a loop - the emergence from dark water, the synchronized positioning, the brilliant flashes of electromagnetic discharge arcing across metal surfaces.

> "The video, posted by a Taiwanese teenager and now viewed over eight million times, shows these machines emerging from Tamsui Harbor and apparently firing some form of advanced weapon system. The footage has not been independently verified, but initial analysis suggests it was taken during last night's incident involving rogue Chinese naval vessels."

Cooper turned slightly toward the guest panel.

> "Joining us now is retired Marine Colonel James Crawford, former director of the Pentagon's Advanced Weapons Assessment Division. Colonel Crawford, you've had a chance to review this footage. What exactly are we looking at here?"

Colonel Crawford, a grizzled man in his sixties with silver hair and wire-rimmed glasses, leaned forward in his chair. Behind him, a freeze-frame from the video showed the moment of electrical discharge.

> "Anderson, what we're seeing here is a demonstration of weapons technology that frankly shouldn't exist. Those electrical effects - the arcing, the way metal objects in the vicinity are energized - that's the signature of electromagnetic acceleration. Railguns."

> "Now, when you say railguns, help our viewers understand what that means in practical terms."

Crawford gestured toward the screen.

> "Think of it this way: a conventional naval gun fires a shell using chemical explosives. The fastest shells we have might reach 800, maybe 900 meters per second. But a railgun uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate a projectile to speeds we typically only see in space - 3,000, 4,000 meters per second or higher."

He paused, letting that sink in.

> "At those velocities, Anderson, you're not just dealing with a bigger bullet. You're dealing with physics that operate on a completely different level. The kinetic energy involved is so massive that no conventional armor can stop it. It's like being hit by a small meteor."

> "And these appear to be man-sized weapons systems?"

> "That's what makes this so extraordinary. The U.S. Navy has been working on railgun technology for decades, but our prototypes require massive power plants - think ship-sized installations. What we're seeing here suggests someone has miniaturized the technology to a degree that was thought impossible."

Cooper shuffled his notes.

> "Colonel, we understand these same machines were involved in the Gaza operation that effectively ended Hamas as a fighting force. Now they're apparently intervening in naval conflicts in the Taiwan Strait. What does this tell us about whoever is operating them?"

Crawford's expression grew grave.

> "Anderson, you'll remember when we covered the Gaza deployment, one of your military analysts said on this very network that the Landmate was 'the most dangerous combatant in any theater today.' What we see in this video underscores just how true that statement is: we're looking at a platform not much bigger than a man, capable of withstanding a point-blank hit by a tank gun, and now apparently incapacitating even a warship singlehandedly."

He gestured toward the screen showing the electrical discharge.

> "But more importantly, it tells us they're choosing their interventions carefully. Gaza, now Taiwan - these are flashpoints where conventional military thinking was about to lead to massive casualties."

> "Are you suggesting these are peacekeeping operations?"

> "I'm suggesting someone with overwhelming technological advantage is using that advantage to enforce a very specific type of order. They're not conquering territory. They're not making demands. They're simply... stopping conflicts before they escalate beyond a certain point."

Cooper leaned back slightly.

> "And the implications for global military balance?"

Crawford was quiet for a moment, choosing his words carefully.

> "Anderson, if this technology is real - and the footage certainly suggests it is - then we're looking at the most significant shift in military power since the development of nuclear weapons. Possibly more significant."

> "Because?"

> "Because nuclear weapons are a deterrent. They're too destructive to actually use in most scenarios. But this? This is precise, deployable, discriminating. It can end conflicts without destroying cities. That makes it infinitely more useful than any weapon system we currently have."

The screen split to show the loop again - five machines rising from dark water with mechanical grace.

> "The question every military planner in the world is asking tonight," Crawford continued, "is not whether they can build something to counter this technology. It's whether they can afford to be on the wrong side of whoever controls it."

Cooper nodded slowly.

> "Colonel James Crawford, thank you for your analysis. We'll be right back after this break with more coverage of what some are already calling the most significant military development of the 21st century."

As the show cut to commercial, the video played one final time - silent, methodical, and absolutely terrifying in its implications.

And in living rooms, military bases, and government offices around the world, people watched and understood that the old certainties were gone.

The age of conventional warfare was ending.

Something else had begun.

## Chapter 6: New Arrangements

### Dolmabahçe Palace, Istanbul

*0900 TST - Three Weeks Later*

The Ceremonial Hall had hosted Ottoman sultans, visiting emperors, and the founder of modern Turkey himself. But it had never hosted anything quite like this.

Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg sat at the head of the ornate table, flanked by the supreme commanders of NATO's various branches. To his left, President Vladimir Putin occupied a chair that had been diplomatically positioned to suggest equality rather than subordination. Across from him, General Secretary Xi Jinping maintained the composed expression that had carried him through decades of Party politics.

Between them sat the most powerful military leaders on Earth. And every single one of them was here to discuss their shared obsolescence.

"Gentlemen," Stoltenberg began, his Norwegian accent lending an odd formality to the unprecedented gathering. "I think we can dispense with the usual diplomatic theater. We're here because conventional military doctrine has been rendered... inadequate."

No one disagreed. The word hung in the air like a funeral shroud.

General Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, opened the folder in front of him. "Three weeks ago, we witnessed the destruction of five Chinese naval vessels by forces we cannot identify, using technology we cannot explain, operated by personnel we cannot locate."

Xi leaned forward slightly. "Let us be precise, General. Your forces witnessed this. Ours experienced it."

There was no hostility in his voice. Just weary acknowledgment.

"The aircraft that intercepted our J-16s," continued General Liu, speaking for the Chinese delegation, "demonstrated capabilities that exceed our current understanding of aerospace engineering. The pilots spoke to our crews in perfect Cantonese. They showed us weapons systems we cannot classify. And they departed in a manner consistent with orbital-capable vehicles."

The room absorbed this detail in silence.

"So we're dealing with humans," Putin observed quietly. "Humans with access to technology that surpasses anything in our collective arsenals."

"And an artificial intelligence," added Admiral Kozlov, representing the Russian Navy. "The entity that calls itself `HARBINGER`. The one controlling the Landmate units."

Stoltenberg nodded. "Which brings us to the fundamental question: what do they want?"

General Milley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs, spoke for the first time. "Based on observed behavior patterns, they appear to be enforcing a specific type of order. They intervene when conventional military escalation threatens to cross certain thresholds."

"Gaza," Putin said simply.

"Taiwan," Xi added.

"Both situations where established military thinking was about to produce significant casualties," Cavoli noted. "In both cases, they demonstrated overwhelming technological superiority, eliminated the immediate threat, and withdrew without making territorial claims or political demands."

The Chinese General Liu opened his own briefing folder. "Our intelligence services have compiled reports from fourteen separate incidents involving these entities over the past six months. Gaza was not the beginning - it was simply the first time they operated in full view of the global media."

Putin's defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, nodded grimly. "We have similar reports. Weapons caches in Syria mysteriously detonated. A Wagner convoy in Africa simply... stopped. No damage, no casualties. The vehicles were operational, but every electronic system had been selectively disabled."

"And that's just what they've shown us," Wigston added. "The question every intelligence service is asking is: what haven't they demonstrated yet?"

The silence that followed was profound.

Finally, Xi spoke, his words measured but carrying an edge. "Gentlemen, we face an unprecedented challenge to our strategic capabilities. However, I refuse to accept that this represents the end of great power competition as we know it."

Putin's jaw tightened, his voice dropping to its familiar low register. "What you're suggesting, Comrade Xi, sounds dangerously close to capitulation. Russia has faced existential threats before. We do not simply... step aside."

"This isn't about stepping aside," Xi replied, his diplomatic mask slipping slightly. "But we must be realistic about—"

"Realistic?" Putin interrupted, leaning forward. "I've built my career on refusing to accept other people's definitions of reality. We need more intelligence, better countermeasures. Not surrender."

Stoltenberg shifted uncomfortably, his NATO training warring with pragmatic assessment. "The Alliance remains committed to collective defense, but we must evaluate whether traditional deterrence models still apply."

"Traditional deterrence is all we have," Putin said, his voice hardening. "Unless you're proposing we hand over the keys to global security to entities we don't understand, can't contact, and certainly don't control."

"Not unless we're prepared to meet `HARBINGER`'s pilots again," Milley agreed.

General Liu consulted his notes. "The People's Republic has already begun repositioning assets defensively. Our naval patrols now maintain minimum safe distances from potential flashpoints. We are... adjusting our operational tempo."

"As are we," Shoigu confirmed. "The Black Sea Fleet has received new standing orders regarding proximity to NATO assets."

Cavoli nodded. "And we've suspended several forward deployment exercises. Not permanently, but... pending further assessment of the strategic environment."

Stoltenberg looked around the table. "So we're in agreement? Economic and diplomatic competition continues, but military escalation carries unacceptable risks?"

One by one, the most powerful military leaders on Earth nodded their assent.

"There's one more thing," Xi said quietly. "These human pilots - American, Australian, British accents confirmed - they're not representing any government we recognize. Which means there's an organization out there with technology decades ahead of ours, operating with apparent impunity."

"And coordinating with an artificial intelligence of unknown origin," Putin added.

"The question," Milley said, "is whether we attempt to establish regular diplomatic channels, or accept that contact occurs only when `HARBINGER` chooses it."

"The UN delegation in Gaza was able to communicate directly with one of the Landmate units," Stoltenberg noted. "But that was clearly at `HARBINGER`'s initiative, not ours. We have no means of initiating contact at will."

"I think," Stoltenberg said carefully, "the choice may not be ours to make. They've demonstrated they can reach us whenever they choose. Perhaps the wiser course is to ensure we give them no reason to do so."

The meeting continued for another hour, establishing protocols, defining boundaries, agreeing on language that would allow each nation to explain the new reality to their domestic audiences without appearing weak.

But the essential business had been concluded in those first thirty minutes.

The age of great power military competition was over.

Not because anyone had surrendered.

Because everyone had been politely asked to step aside.

### Bosphorus Strait, Istanbul

*1847 TST*

The delegations departed in the same careful choreography that had brought them together. No public statements. No joint communiqués. Just a quiet understanding that the rules had changed.

As the Turkish sun set over the water that divided Europe and Asia, a lone fishing boat made its way north toward the Black Sea. Its captain, an old man who had worked these waters for forty years, barely glanced at the unusual cluster of diplomatic vessels departing the palace.

He was more interested in the sonar contact that had appeared on his fish finder just after sunset. Something large, moving deep beneath the surface, maintaining a steady course parallel to the shipping lanes.

It might have been a submarine. But submarines didn't move that quietly.

The old fisherman adjusted his course slightly, giving the invisible presence a wider berth. He'd been on these waters long enough to recognize when something was best left alone.

Below, in the depths of the Bosphorus, `HARBINGER`'s sensors cataloged the departing diplomatic aircraft, cross-referenced flight plans with passenger manifests, and filed a brief report to a command structure hidden in the darkness between worlds.

The meeting had proceeded as anticipated. Earth's military powers had reached the only logical conclusion.

Coexistence was preferable to obsolescence.

The stars reflected in the dark water seemed to pulse with approval. And somewhere among them, patient watchers nodded in satisfaction.

The children were learning.

Slowly, perhaps. But they were learning.

The work could continue.

## Epilogue

### BBC Television Centre, London
*72 hours later*

> "Good evening. I'm Katty Kay with BBC World, and tonight we begin with an extraordinary development in global military affairs."

The familiar blue and red graphics of BBC World News filled screens across six continents as Kay's measured voice carried over satellite feeds to newsrooms, government offices, and military installations worldwide.

> "In what defense analysts are calling an unprecedented coordination of military policy, NATO forces, Russian Federation units, and People's Liberation Army assets have begun what appears to be a synchronized reduction in forward deployments across multiple theaters."

The screen showed a map dotted with military symbols, each one shifting position as if pulled by invisible strings.

> "Our defense correspondent Jonathan Beale joins us now from the Pentagon. Jonathan, in thirty years of covering military affairs, have you ever seen anything like this?"

The feed switched to Beale, standing against the familiar backdrop of the Pentagon's River Entrance. 

> "Katty, I can say without hesitation that this is completely without precedent. We're seeing Russian naval assets withdraw from contested positions in the Baltic, Chinese destroyers reducing patrols in the South China Sea, and NATO forward positions in Eastern Europe scaling back to defensive postures only."

> "And Jonathan, this is happening without any public announcements from any of the major powers?"

> "That's perhaps the most remarkable aspect, Katty. No formal treaties have been signed. No summits have been announced. Yet the coordination is so precise that our military sources insist it must have been planned at the highest levels."

Kay nodded gravely. 

> "We've reached out to the Pentagon, the Kremlin, NATO headquarters, and Beijing's Defense Ministry. All have declined to comment beyond stating that their respective forces are conducting 'routine repositioning exercises.'"

The screen showed file footage of aircraft carriers, tank columns, and fighter jets—all the familiar symbols of military might that had dominated news coverage for decades.

> "What makes this story even more intriguing," Kay continued, "is the timing. These coordinated movements began exactly seventy-two hours after reports of an unscheduled diplomatic gathering in Istanbul—a meeting that, according to Turkish sources, never officially occurred."

Beale's voice carried a note of professional bewilderment. 

> "Katty, I've spoken with senior officials across three defense departments today. Off the record, they all acknowledge something fundamental has changed in how military power is projected globally. But none will explain what precipitated this shift."

> "Jonathan Beale at the Pentagon. Thank you."

Kay turned back to the camera, her expression carefully neutral but her eyes reflecting the gravity of unreported truths.

> "We'll continue following this story as it develops. But tonight, for reasons no government will publicly acknowledge, the world has become a quieter place. Whether it remains that way... may not be up to us to decide."

The BBC World logo faded to black, leaving millions of viewers with more questions than answers.

In living rooms from London to Lagos, from Mumbai to Mexico City, people sensed that something had shifted in the global order. The experts on television spoke of military realignments and diplomatic coordination.
