## The Ambush

The *Galara's Hope* was a freighter designed for peaceful purposes—long-haul logistics, carrying high-value, low-volume cargo across systems, and never built for a fight. Kryllian efficiency meshed with Xenari elegance to create a vessel that was sleek, functional, and, most importantly, unarmed. It had neither shields nor point defenses—because it was never meant to need them.

At least, until now.

Red alert klaxons pulsed through the corridors as the bridge crew stared at the tactical display in frozen disbelief. The ship had just come out of warp near the Kuros Belt, a quiet stretch of space where unauthorized scans were rare. Yet, someone had been waiting for them. A pirate cruiser, ugly and cobbled together from salvaged wreckage, now sat between *Galara’s Hope* and its only viable escape vector. The ship's transponder identified it as the *Red Fang*, a name unknown to the Federation’s more established threat lists. That meant an upstart group, either reckless or desperate enough to attack a joint-operated freighter.

"Incoming transmission," announced Selaari, the Xenari communications officer, her silvered crest pulsing with agitation.

A crackling voice came over the speakers. "Freighter *Galara's Hope*, you are carrying cargo far beyond your pay grade. Power down your engines, prepare to be boarded, and nobody gets spaced today. Try anything clever, and we'll cut you open."

The bridge fell silent. Everyone understood the stakes. The freighter’s manifest included next-generation quantum computing chips bound for a Xenari R&D hub—technology valuable enough to tempt even the most cautious pirates.

Naomi Campbell, one of the two human engineers aboard, exhaled slowly. She wasn’t a soldier, just an exchange specialist from the EarthSpace Federation, here to study Kryllian power distribution systems. This? This was a mess.

“They scanned us,” Chief Engineer Karvanista growled, his voice a low rumble. His Kryllian features, a blend of chitinous plates and smooth flesh, were drawn tight with frustration. “They know we have no weapons.”

Naomi’s colleague, Leonard Park, shot her a sidelong glance. “But they don’t know what we *can* do.”

She turned to Karvanista. “Chief, how much power can this drive put out again?” Her tone was just casual enough to be dangerous.

Karvanista hesitated. “Approximately 460 of your... gigawatts, if I calculate correctly, human engineer Campbell.”

Naomi grinned. “Ooooh, we have ourselves a *very big weapon*, then.”

The Kryllian engineers exchanged looks, antennae twitching in a way that translated across species: concern. 

Karvanista narrowed his eyes. “What are you planning, human engineers?”

## Improv Everywhere

The *Galara’s Hope* shuddered slightly as the *Red Fang* closed the distance, its predatory silhouette looming larger on the bridge’s tactical display. The pirate cruiser was taking its time, deliberately ensuring there was no chance of escape. Their confidence was clear—they had scanned the freighter, confirmed it was defenseless, and now they were circling in for the kill.

Naomi and Leonard had other plans.

Leonard turned to Naomi, his face splitting into a wide grin. "Naomi... are you thinking what I'm thinking?"

A beat of silence passed between them before they both exclaimed in unison, "Drive plume!"

The Kryllians on the bridge flinched at the sudden outburst.

Naomi whirled on Karvanista and the assembled engineers. "Look, we're standing in a *gigantic plasma lance*! We just need to focus the drive plume—screw the safeties, and we have ourselves a weapon they never thought we had!"

Karvanista’s compound eyes blinked in rapid succession, the Kryllian equivalent of shock. "That would require bypassing multiple safety protocols! The heat output alone—"

"—is exactly what we need," Leonard cut in, already tapping furiously at his wristpad to bring up the ship's engineering schematics. "Your engine design is beautiful, but we can tweak the magnetic nozzle to extend and *collimate* the exhaust into a focused stream. We turn the entire drive into a directed-energy weapon."

"At the expense of fuel efficiency," Naomi added under her breath.

Karvanista’s mandibles clicked in distress. "You cannot simply *redesign* a fusion drive in minutes—"

"Not redesigning," Naomi interrupted, already moving to the engineering console. "Just reprogramming. I’ll handle the firmware overrides. Leonard, you take a team and physically reroute the plasma feeds."

Leonard clapped his hands together. "On it." He grabbed two Kryllian engineers by the arms, dragging them toward the hatch. "Come on, friends, we’ve got some illegal modifications to make!"

The Kryllians glanced at Karvanista, who hesitated for half a second before nodding reluctantly. "Assist them. And do *not* incinerate us all."

The bridge was now a flurry of movement. Naomi dove into the ship’s systems, fingers flying over the console as she accessed the drive’s control architecture. Kryllian safety protocols were robust—*very* robust—but they weren’t built with human recklessness in mind. 

> **WARNING: SAFETY OVERRIDES ENGAGED. DRIVE OPERATION OUTSIDE NORMAL PARAMETERS.**  
> **DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED?**  
> **[YES] [NO]**  

Naomi punched *YES* without hesitation.

Leonard’s voice crackled over comms. "We're almost at the main plasma conduit. I need control of the magnetic containment coils."

"Working on it." Naomi brought up the schematic of the drive, fingers dancing as she rerouted energy priorities. The *Red Fang* had no idea what was about to hit them. 

The pirate cruiser was now within boarding range.

Their timer was running out.

## Cornered

The *Galara’s Hope* trembled under Naomi’s fingers as she forced the ship’s drive firmware into accepting commands no sane engineer would ever authorize. Emergency warnings flashed across the console—overheat limits exceeded, safety tolerances ignored, structural integrity alarms blaring—but she kept going, stripping every safeguard down to the bare minimum.

This was going to work.

It had to.

"Okay," she exhaled, fingers lifting off the console for the first time in what felt like an eternity. "That should do it. It'll give us one heck of a lance, but it's still short range."

Karvanista loomed over her shoulder, his antennae twitching in barely contained anxiety. "Short range?"  

"Yeah," she admitted, rolling her shoulders. "A plasma jet this concentrated won’t stay coherent at long distances, but we don’t *need* range. We just need them close enough to light ‘em up."

The Kryllian chief engineer let out a sound that was half a resigned sigh, half a growl.

Naomi wasn’t done. "Chief, tell the helm to do an about-face and point our drive at the pirates, but keep it powered down—just like they asked." She finally looked up, the edges of her lips curling in a smirk. "Oh, and transfer drive and throttle control to this console."

Karvanista grumbled something about human madness but relayed the order. 

Across the ship, the crew braced as *Galara’s Hope* began a slow, deliberate rotation. To the pirates, it would look like compliance—the meek, unarmed freighter turning to expose its engines in surrender. Exactly what they wanted.

Naomi tapped her earpiece. "Leonard, how are we doing with the couplings?"

The response was immediate, though it was punctuated by the sound of frantic welding. "They'll hold. Not for long, but they'll take the increased power. I'll give them one minute at full blast, then they're toast, so that’s how long you have."

Naomi grinned. "One minute’s all I need." 

The *Red Fang* edged closer, closing the last few kilometers.  

Naomi’s fingers hovered over the improvised fire control. Just a little closer, she thought.

Just a little more.

They were about to learn why you never cornered an engineer.

## Lighting the Torch

Naomi's hands hovered over the throttle control, the air in the engineering bay thick with tension. On the tactical display, the *Red Fang* loomed in the black, its patchwork hull illuminated only by its own running lights and the faint glow of its ion drives. They were close now—too close. 

Perfect.

She exhaled, fingers tightening. "Leonard, Karvanista—get ready."

Karvanista muttered something in Kryllian, probably a prayer to whatever deities looked after engineers. Leonard just grinned through the comms. 

With a final keystroke, Naomi disabled the drive’s startup safeties.

Then she *pushed* the throttle forward.

A deep, guttural *whump* echoed through the ship as the *Galara’s Hope*’s fusion drive flared to life—not in the standard smooth ignition sequence, but in a violent surge of magnetic confinement fields twisting and writhing against raw stellar energy. The plasma jet that erupted from the nozzle wasn’t just an exhaust stream anymore. It was a concentrated, directed spear of high-energy fusion plasma, a *weapon* in everything but name.

The *Red Fang*’s crew must have seen the warning signs—reactor surge, radiation spikes—but they had no time to react.

The plasma lance struck the pirate cruiser dead-on, square at the bow.

For a fraction of a second, nothing happened.

Then, the *Red Fang*'s forward plating *ceased to exist*.

The hull, already stressed from its patchwork construction, didn’t stand a chance against the sheer thermal energy being delivered in a fraction of a second. The armor, conduits, and bulkheads at the impact site rose to millions of Kelvin instantaneously, superheating into vapor and then into *plasma*, completely bypassing molten states. 

The beam kept going.

It punched straight through the *Red Fang’s* bow, bored through its spine, and *exited* through the ventral keel, a glowing tunnel of destruction left in its wake.

Inside the cruiser, compartments violently depressurized. Superheated gas and molten debris exploded outward in all directions, eating through passageways and vaporizing anything unfortunate enough to be near the impact site. Internal atmosphere vented explosively from the breach points, forming twin jets of white-hot plasma that expanded into the void. 

The ship *screamed*—not audibly, but in the way its lights flickered and its running systems spasmed before going dark.

By some miracle, the main reactor wasn’t hit. 

Not that it mattered.

The damage was too extensive, too catastrophic for the *Red Fang’s* damage control systems to handle. Its crew would be fighting against a rapidly failing environment, dwindling life support, and a ship no longer capable of propulsion.

It was over.

Naomi let go of the throttle, breathing out the tension in her chest. The *Galara’s Hope*'s engines whined as they returned to idle, leaving behind only the sight of the pirate cruiser shutting down, venting atmosphere into the void like a dying beast.

She turned to Karvanista. "That's done. Now, while I undo all my modifications, have the captain send someone out to rescue any survivors. *If* there are any."

Karvanista looked at her as though she had just suggested setting fire to the ship's cargo hold. "Surely, human engineer Campbell, you cannot expect us to save those who wanted to kill us just now?!"

Naomi held his gaze, her voice steady. "That ship is no longer a threat, Chief. If we leave them out there, we might as well turn ourselves in at the next starbase for ... I don't even know how many counts of premeditated murder. Get them onboard, lock them in one of the holds, and we drop them off at the next starbase for the judiciary to deal with."

Karvanista's mandibles clicked together in frustration, but after a long moment, he exhaled. "*Fine.* I will notify the captain." He turned, muttering something about the illogical moral compass of humans as he did.

Leonard's voice came through the comms, amused. "Well, that was fun. Let’s never do it again."

Naomi laughed, already pulling up the drive’s command system. "Agreed. Now let’s clean up the evidence before someone asks *too many* questions."

## Special Delivery

The *Galara’s Hope* emerged from warp at the edge of the next system, its hull still radiating residual heat from its unconventional battle. The station ahead—*Azimuth Relay 12*, a bustling trade hub operated jointly by Xenari and Kryllian authorities—glowed against the darkness, its docking spires reaching outward like metallic arms welcoming inbound vessels.

Naomi stretched, rolling her shoulders as she leaned against the console. The past few hours had been a whirlwind—jury-rigging the drive, nearly liquefying a pirate ship, and then, surprisingly, *rescuing* the very people who had tried to kill them.

The rescued pirates had been subdued and locked in a cargo hold with emergency life support, and despite their initial resistance, they had offered no further trouble. Perhaps the sight of their ruined ship drifting powerless in the void had sobered them.

On the bridge, Captain Sevalan, a Xenari with a commanding yet almost serene presence, activated the comms channel to *Azimuth Relay 12*. The holographic projection of the station’s dockmaster, a Kryllian with a finely polished chitinous exoskeleton, flickered into view.

_"This is *Galara’s Hope*, requesting docking clearance. We are also transmitting an urgent notice to station security."_ Sevalan’s voice was calm, but firm.

The Kryllian dockmaster’s antennae twitched in mild curiosity. _“We have received your manifest. Your vessel is not listed for security concerns. What is the nature of this request?”_

Naomi exchanged a glance with Karvanista, who was still glowering about having to play by the rules. She smirked and turned back to her console, letting the captain handle it.

Sevalan folded his hands behind his back. _“We have prisoners aboard. Pirates. Survivors of a vessel that attempted to intercept us between systems.”_

That got the dockmaster’s attention. His crest flared slightly. _“Pirates? In this sector? You have their ship?”_

“Destroyed,” Sevalan corrected. “What remains of it is venting atmosphere somewhere in the Kuros Belt.”

The dockmaster’s mandibles clicked, clearly intrigued. _“And the prisoners? Are they in stable condition?”_

“Stunned. A few grateful to be alive. A handful remorseful,” Sevalan said, glancing at his notes. “One attempted to bite a security officer and is still unconscious.”

Naomi winced. “I feel like I should apologize for that one.”

Karvanista huffed. “They should be apologizing to *us*.”

The dockmaster studied them all for a moment before nodding. _“Very well. Security will be waiting at your designated docking bay. Stand by for approach vector.”_

As the transmission ended, Leonard leaned back in his chair with a smug grin. “You know, I bet those guys never thought *we’d* be the ones saving their hides today.”

Naomi smirked. “I bet they never thought an unarmed freighter would gut their ship like a roast.” She stood, stretching. “Come on, we should probably be there when they get handed over.”

Karvanista shook his head but followed them toward the docking bay. "Humans are entirely too sentimental."

Sevalan, behind them, simply smiled as he guided the *Galara’s Hope* toward the station. 

Justice—at least in a bureaucratic, well-documented sense—was about to be served.

## Epilogue: Torchlight Fades

The pirate survivors were a sorry sight as they were marched off *Galara’s Hope* and into the waiting hands of *Azimuth Relay 12*’s security forces. Some looked too stunned to process what had happened, still pale from the trauma of their ship being nearly incinerated in seconds. Others carried an air of subdued acceptance, knowing they had pushed their luck too far. A few muttered quiet thanks as they were handed over—perhaps recognizing that without the mercy of the freighter crew, they would be nothing but frozen corpses drifting in the void.  

Naomi and Leonard watched as station security processed the prisoners. They answered a few formal questions, gave their statements, and let Sevalan handle the official handoff. Soon enough, the pirates were locked away, awaiting trial at the next major Kryllian judiciary station.  

With that business concluded, *Galara’s Hope* resumed its journey. The ship’s massive frame glided from the docking bay, aligning with its next jump vector. As soon as it cleared the station’s safety perimeter, the warp drive activated, hurtling them toward the stargate that would take them to the next system on their route.  

In the quiet hum of post-crisis calm, Naomi and Leonard found themselves back on the bridge alongside Captain Sevalan and Chief Karvanista.  

Sevalan, ever composed, glanced between the two humans with an air of curiosity. "Now that we are no longer in imminent peril, I find myself compelled to ask: *how*, precisely, did you devise that solution on such short notice?"  

Naomi smirked, folding her arms. "Honestly? We just thought about what we had on hand. No weapons? Fine. But we've got a fusion drive. A *big* one. And if there's one thing humans love, it's improvising."  

Leonard nodded. "The real trick was rerouting the plasma feed and overriding the safeties. Plasma nozzles are meant to spread the exhaust wide to avoid hull damage. We just reversed that thinking—focused it instead of dispersing it. Turned a propulsion system into a directed-energy weapon."  

Karvanista’s mandibles clicked in reluctant admiration. "An impressive display of lateral thinking. And recklessness."  

"Recklessness is half the fun," Leonard quipped.  

Sevalan gave a rare chuckle, then turned serious. "It was effective. But dangerous. If you had miscalculated—"  

"We’d be space dust," Naomi finished. "But that’s engineering, isn’t it? Risk management, problem-solving, making things work when they *really* shouldn’t."  

Karvanista exhaled through his nasal vents. "You humans have an unhealthy relationship with calculated risk."  

Leonard grinned. "Yeah, but it works."  

Karvanista sighed, conceding the point.  

Leonard tapped his chin thoughtfully. "Oh, one more thing, Chief. How much do you know about human literature?"  

Karvanista tilted his head, intrigued but wary. "I must admit, human engineer Park, I only know about the basics your patrons have shared with us. Human poet Shakespeare, human poet Poe, human writer Tolkien, and a handful of others."  

Leonard’s eyes sparkled with mischief. "Ooooh, I’m going to lend you a few books by this one guy *Larry Niven*! I think you’ll recognize a few moments…"  

As *Galara’s Hope* entered warp toward the stargate, the glow of its engine flaring behind it, Sevalan watched his human engineers with quiet amusement.  

They were chaotic, reckless, and far too willing to gamble with physics.  

But, in a crisis?  

He was glad they were on *his* ship.

## Encore: The Last Breath of the *Red Fang*  

Tarkin Voss had been a pirate for nearly fifteen years. He’d seen ships panic at the sight of a cruiser, watched captains crumble under the pressure of a boarding action. The *Red Fang* was no mere raider; it was the kind of ship that made freighters cut their drives and beg for mercy.  

That’s what *Galara’s Hope* should have done.  

Instead, it had turned its back to them.  

Voss stood on the bridge, arms crossed, a satisfied smirk creeping across his scarred face. The Kryllian-Xenari freighter was just another unarmed cargo hauler, carrying tech they could ransom or resell. No shields. No weapons. Just a fat prize waiting to be taken.  

“Captain,” one of his bridge officers called from the sensor station, frowning. “I’m picking up something weird from their drive. It’s powering up.”  

Voss barely spared a glance. “Probably trying to run. They won’t get far. Lock tractor beams.”  

“Negative, sir. They’re not spooling their warp drive… just their fusion torch.”  

Voss turned fully now, a thread of unease creeping into his gut. “Why the hell would they—”  

The *Red Fang’s* main display flooded with warning indicators. Radiation alarms screamed.  

Then the universe *caught fire*.  

A column of *pure white-hot plasma* erupted from the freighter’s drive like the breath of an angry god.  

For the briefest of moments, the pirate crew didn’t process what they were seeing. Fusion torches weren’t weapons. Ships *ran* from them, they didn’t turn them into *lances of death*.  

Voss had a single, fleeting thought—*impossible*.  

Then the plasma hit.  

The *Red Fang*'s forward hull ceased to exist. One moment, reinforced plating and thick armor; the next, a *hole* where the bow used to be, its atoms scattered into the void.  

A hellish light filled the bridge as the raw, sun-hot energy bored *through* the ship’s spine. The heat was so intense that metal didn't just melt—it sublimated, skipping the liquid phase entirely, turning directly into glowing vapor. Compartments erupted like overpressured boilers, atmosphere screaming out into vacuum.  

“Shields! SHIELDS!” someone shrieked, but it was too late.  

The *Red Fang* wasn’t *damaged*.  

It was *gutted*.  

The plasma jet carved a tunnel straight through the ship, venting crew, debris, and whole sections of deck plating into the void. A maintenance worker two levels down had only a second to scream before he was atomized. The forward bulkheads collapsed as the entire ship hemorrhaged superheated gas.  

Voss barely clung to the edge of his chair as the bridge lights flickered, then *died*. Gravity stuttered.  

“Reactors still stable!” one of the engineers howled from the pit below. “But—ship’s venting! Emergency seals aren’t holding!”  

Voss looked at the forward display—or what was left of it. The *Red Fang’s* bow was *gone*. The front half of the ship was nothing but a skeletal ruin, glowing white-hot from residual heat.  

They were dead in space.  

No maneuvering. No comms. No weapons.  

The freighter—*the unarmed freighter*—had just *killed them*.  

His second-in-command, a wiry woman named Dreva, stared at the screen in dumb horror. “That was their *drive*,” she whispered. “They *aimed* their drive at us.”  

Voss’ breath came in short, ragged bursts. The predator had become the prey. No… worse. The predator had been burned alive before it even had the chance to fight.  

He pressed a bloodied hand against his forehead, his mind finally accepting the truth.  

They’d lost.  

The *Red Fang* was dead.  

And the *Galara’s Hope*—a freighter they’d expected to roll over and surrender—was still flying.  

Voss let out a bitter, choked laugh as the ship’s life support flickered. His last coherent thought before unconsciousness took him was maddening in its irony.  

*We should’ve never picked this fight.*
