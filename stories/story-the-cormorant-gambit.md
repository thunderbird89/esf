## In the Void

Darkness and silence blanketed the bridge of the ESF *Cormorant*, broken only by the dim glow of emergency lighting and the steady, faint beeps of the ship's life-support system. The vessel tumbled slowly through the asteroid field, her hull riddled with impact craters and deep scoring from energy burns. To any outside observer—especially the trio of Ryzak frigates circling like predators—the *Cormorant* was dead in space.  

Inside, the crew of the experimental fast destroyer sat strapped into their acceleration couches, their breath slow, eyes scanning their dimly lit consoles. Every unnecessary system had been powered down, masking their thermal signature against the asteroids. Only the bare minimum of life support and passive sensors remained active.  

Commander Helen Voss watched the tactical display on her wrist-mounted holo-interface, the icons of the three Ryzak warships pulsing red as they drifted ever closer. Their prey's apparent death throes had drawn them in. Typical Ryzak. Opportunists. Predators.  

Across from her, the Xenari observer, Envoy Zhaeleth, shifted uncomfortably in his seat. His pale, almost translucent skin shimmered in the low light, and his eyes—large, lidless, and filled with anxious energy—darted from Voss to the main viewport. The sight of the Ryzak vessels looming in the distance clearly unsettled him.  

"Commander Voss," Zhaeleth murmured, his voice a whisper of restrained concern. "Surely, we should engage evasive maneuvers. This—this waiting is suicide."  

Voss didn't look at him. Instead, she smirked, her fingers drumming against her console. "That's exactly what they think we're doing, Envoy. Dying."  

Zhaeleth's throat quivered in the Xenari equivalent of a gulp. "A deceptive tactic, then?"  

"More like a bar fight in space," Lieutenant Darrin Cole muttered from the gunnery station, his fingers wrapped around the fire controls. "You let the bastard think he's got you on the ground, then you put a knife in his ribs when he leans in close."  

Zhaeleth exhaled, his skin shifting slightly in hue. "Crude."  

"But effective," Voss said. "And that's all that matters."  

The *Cormorant* was an anomaly of Federation warship design—built for speed and aggression rather than defense. Her oversized fusion torches gave her brutal acceleration, and her weapons layout favored forward-facing firepower rather than broadside engagements. A single spinal-mounted railgun, capable of punching through a warship's hull like a fist through glass, was her main weapon. Flanking it were turreted short-range autocannons, each capable of shredding enemy armor at close range. In open combat, she was a duelist, a knife fighter—if she could get in close.  

And that was the plan.  

"Captain," Amos Rhys, the *Cormorant*'s pilot, spoke for the first time in minutes, his voice a low rasp of anticipation. "We're down to five kilometers. They'll be inside our range in thirty seconds."  

The Ryzak were taking the bait, moving into optimal range to scavenge what they assumed was a crippled vessel. Their mistake.  

Voss tightened her grip on her restraints and leaned forward. Her voice was calm, resolute.  

"Amos," she said, her lips curling into a razor-thin smile.  

"Light her up."  

## Burning Bright

The moment the order left Voss' lips, the *Cormorant* roared back to life.

Fusion torches flared with sudden, blinding intensity, stabilizing the destroyer's wild tumble in an instant. External plating vibrated under the rapid reactivation of internal systems, heat radiators bloomed, and the ship's electronic suite flooded the surrounding void with sensor pings.

The Ryzak frigates had no time to react.

Like a predator coiling before the kill, the *Cormorant* pivoted with a savage efficiency, autocannon turrets locking onto the nearest enemy vessel. A fraction of a second later, the void erupted in a hail of hypervelocity rounds.

The first Ryzak frigate barely had time to bring up its shields before its hull was ripped apart. The ship's armor crumpled under the relentless onslaught, sections of bulkhead shredded like paper as the explosive shells found fuel lines and reactor conduits. A detonation blossomed outward, a fiery nova blooming in the asteroid field, leaving nothing but rapidly expanding debris.

Before the second frigate could veer off, the *Cormorant*'s railgun fired.

A single, hyper-dense slug left the ship's forward accelerator with a silent, devastating pulse of electromagnetic force. It lanced through the enemy vessel's midsection, shearing through its structural spine in less than a heartbeat. The impact sent a shockwave of kinetic force through the frigate's frame, snapping it in half. Fire and atmosphere spewed into the black, a slow, agonized death for the crippled warship as its remains spun aimlessly into the asteroid field.

The third Ryzak frigate saw its fate and bolted.

"Frigate is retreating, Captain," Lieutenant Cole announced, his voice tight with adrenaline. "They're already burning at max thrust."

Voss didn't even hesitate. "Pursuit course, maximum acceleration."

The words sent a ripple of dread through the bridge crew, but no one questioned her. Not even Amos, whose hands were already primed over the thruster controls.

The *Cormorant*'s engines flared to their full, monstrous potential.

A klaxon blared, flashing red across every screen on the bridge:

**[WARNING] ACCELERATION NOT SURVIVABLE**

"Just ... a ... few ... seconds ..." wheezed Amos, his voice strained under the crushing G-forces as the *Cormorant* barreled forward.

The bridge became a warzone of human physiology. Even with their reinforced flight suits and the injected medical supplements stabilizing their cardiovascular systems, every officer felt the brutal weight of their own bodies pressing them deep into their acceleration couches. Blood vessels screamed under the strain. Breath came in ragged gasps. Zhaeleth, utterly unprepared for human levels of suicidal velocity, convulsed as his translucent skin darkened under the pressure.

The *Cormorant* was **gaining**.

The fleeing Ryzak frigate burned hard, but it was never meant for this kind of chase. The *Cormorant* closed the gap in **twenty seconds**, its reinforced frame groaning under the relentless acceleration.

At point-blank range, Voss rasped through the pressure: "Fire."

The railgun's second shot fired with devastating precision. The slug pierced straight through the Ryzak frigate's reactor core, breaching containment.

For half a second, the ship was whole.

Then, light and fury exploded outward in a cataclysmic detonation.

A wave of fire and wreckage erupted in all directions, but the *Cormorant* didn't flinch. She **barreled through the explosion**, her reinforced armor sloughing off the remnants of vaporized enemy hull plating as she roared out of the fireball on the other side, victorious.

The bridge crew gasped for air as the ship's medical systems flooded their veins with counteracting agents, stabilizing blood flow and easing the brutal aftershocks of high-G trauma.

Voss let out a slow breath, unstrapping herself as the ship stabilized. "Amos, take us back to the fleet."

"Aye, ma'am," Rhys replied, voice hoarse from the G-forces. "Setting course."

As they rendezvoused with the surviving Xenari ships, the alien fleet's communications were abuzz with stunned transmissions. Their escort was supposed to be the superior force—yet the *Cormorant* had survived, outgunned and outnumbered, and **won**.

On the bridge, Zhaeleth unstrapped himself with great difficulty. His pale skin had darkened slightly—a Xenari stress response. His gaze swept over the human crew, lingering on Voss with what could only be described as *cautious reverence*.

Finally, he spoke. "Commander Voss… I believe I understand now why your Federation survives against such impossible odds." He exhaled. "You humans are utterly, completely insane."

Voss smirked, glancing at her battered ship with something almost like pride.

"Welcome to the EarthSpace Federation, Envoy," she said. "We call it *creative problem-solving*."  As the *Cormorant* burned back toward the fleet, her hull scorched and her crew battle-worn, the Xenari officer straightened in his seat, inhaled slowly, and muttered something in his native tongue—a phrase that roughly translated to:

*Never—never—bet against the humans.*

## Final Report

Envoy Zhaeleth sat in the quiet confines of his assigned quarters aboard the Xenari diplomatic vessel *Vaelos Prime*, his elongated fingers trembling ever so slightly over the holographic interface of his terminal. The dim, blue lighting of his cabin did little to calm his rattled nerves. Every time he closed his eyes, he could still feel it—the crushing, suffocating weight of acceleration, the monstrous force that had nearly rendered him unconscious. The unrelenting brutality of it all.  

He inhaled slowly, forcing himself to focus on the words materializing on his report.

**To the Council of External Relations, Xenari High Command**  
**Subject: Federation Combat Doctrine Analysis – Cormorant-Class Destroyer Engagement**  

Honored Elders,  

I submit this report with the utmost urgency regarding my observations aboard the Federation vessel *Cormorant* during the recent skirmish with the Ryzak war party. The purpose of my presence was to evaluate the effectiveness of the new human warship design, but I must confess that my findings extend far beyond mere engineering assessments.  

The engagement began with the *Cormorant* in apparent distress, tumbling helplessly through an asteroid field. The Ryzak, seeing an easy kill, advanced with standard predatory aggression. What I did not realize at the time—what I failed to **comprehend**—was that the humans had orchestrated this vulnerability deliberately.  

They **played dead**.  

Not out of desperation. Not out of last resort.  

**It was bait.**  

The moment the Ryzak closed within range, the humans unleashed an ambush with horrifying efficiency. The *Cormorant*, seemingly crippled moments before, surged back to life and **annihilated two warships in under ten seconds**—one with pinpoint autocannon fire, the other with a railgun slug that severed its spine as effortlessly as a blade through silk.  

At this point, any sane force would have been satisfied. Victory was assured. The Ryzak threat was neutralized.  

But the humans were not finished.  

They pursued the final fleeing frigate with a ferocity I struggle to articulate. Rather than let it retreat, they engaged their engines at full burn—**beyond safe acceleration tolerances**—simply to **run it down**. Every warning system aboard their vessel screamed that their own survival was at risk, and yet they did not stop.  

I remember the sensation well.  

**The pressure. The weight. The helplessness.**  

I am ashamed to admit that my physiology nearly failed under the strain, as did that of the entire human crew—**yet they endured it willingly.** Not only did they survive, but they laughed afterward, **as if it were routine.**  

I cannot overstate the significance of this. The humans do not merely fight. They do not simply engage in battle like the Ryzak, with their brutish conquests, nor like us, with calculated diplomacy and superior force projection.  

**They hunt.**  

The concept of self-preservation appears to be an afterthought to them, discarded in favor of something more primal: **pursuit and annihilation.**  

When they caught the final frigate, they **punched a railgun slug through its reactor and flew through the explosion** as if it were nothing.  

I struggle to put into words the sheer, unrelenting madness I witnessed.  

We have long known that the Federation is a dangerous anomaly among the younger species. Their technological gap with us is mitigated by ingenuity, adaptability, and an aggressive mindset that defies our predictions.  

But I submit to you now, esteemed Elders, that their **greatest** weapon is not their technology.  

It is their **nature.**  

I have come to believe that humans do not understand the concept of "acceptable risk" in combat. **They simply do what is necessary to win, regardless of the consequences.**  

And that—above all else—is why they survive.  

I await your guidance on how we should proceed in light of these findings.  

In service to the High Council,  
Envoy Zhaeleth

Zhaeleth exhaled, running a trembling hand down his face. His pulse was still elevated.  

A faint, involuntary tremor ran through his fingertips. He flexed his hands to suppress it.  

Somewhere, deep in the shadows of his thoughts, an unsettling realization took root.  

The Ryzak were terrifying because they were relentless. Their hunger for war was insatiable.  

But the humans?  

The humans were terrifying because they would fight **without limits.**  

Zhaeleth closed his eyes, the ghostly echo of his own words still lingering in his mind:  
*"Never—never—bet against the humans."*

### The Prey That Hunts

#### Before the Kill

Commander Vrak Tohlek flexed his claws in anticipation as the three Ryzak frigates closed in on the drifting human vessel.  

On his bridge, the crew was already preparing for the slaughter. A Federation warship was always a prize, its wreckage useful for intelligence gathering, but a crippled **prototype** was a fortune in its own right.  

The humans were weak.  

They relied on clever tactics, but physically? **Fragile.** The average Ryzak could crush a human's throat with one hand. Their species were built for war—hardened, resilient, ruthless.  

It was only **natural** that the weak be consumed.  

"Target is not responding," his weapons officer rumbled, mandibles clicking as he analyzed the drifting human destroyer. "Minimal heat signatures. No active power."

"It is dead," another crew member muttered.  

Vrak bared his fangs. "Move into boarding range. Strip it for salvage. Tear its—"  

**The human ship ignited.**  

In the span of a heartbeat, its fusion torches flared to full power, bathing the asteroid belt in a sudden, blinding brilliance. The *Cormorant*'s hull vibrated with renewed life, her plating shivering as power surged through her once-dead frame.  

Vrak's eyes widened in disbelief.  

**It was a trap.**  

Before he could bark a command, the *Cormorant* moved.  

#### The Ambush  

"Shields up! Weapons hot! NOW!"

His voice barely carried over the sudden, gut-churning realization that the human ship had not only **been waiting for them**, but had already locked onto its first kill.  

The *Cormorant*'s turreted autocannons came to life, glowing barrels tracking the nearest frigate with **monstrous precision**.  

The air in Vrak's lungs turned to ice as the first salvo fired.  

**A storm of hypervelocity rounds tore through the frigate's armor like wet flesh.**  

The wounded ship lurched violently, its plating **crumpling inward** as the explosive shells chewed through the hull. In less than three seconds, its fuel lines ruptured, the reactor flaring bright for a fraction of a second before the ship **vanished in a fireball.**  

Vrak's claws dug into the armrests of his command chair. **Dead. In seconds.**  

**Impossible.**  

This was not how humans fought. This was not how they **were supposed to fight.**  

They should be defensive, **buying time to escape**, relying on trickery—not **launching an ambush like predators.**  

The second shot from the *Cormorant* came before they could react.  

A **single** railgun slug.  

It struck their sister ship midsection with pinpoint brutality, punching through reinforced armor and rupturing every vital system along its path. The ship **did not explode immediately.**  

It **snapped in half**.  

Vrak barely had time to see the frozen expressions of his Ryzak brethren in the shattered viewport as they were torn from their posts into the vacuum.  

It wasn't just destruction.  

It was **butchery**.  

#### The Fear

"This is not a battle," one of his officers gasped. His voice held something Ryzak did not know how to process. Something **impossible**.  

**Fear.**  

Vrak clenched his mandibles. He had been in over twenty battles against humans. Never had he seen them fight like this.  

Never.  

The third frigate—his frigate—**ran.**  

His helmsman did not wait for an order. The engines fired at **maximum burn**, the ship streaking away from the battlefield with everything it had. It was the only logical move.  

**The humans had already won.**  

But the humans were not **done.**  

Vrak turned to his sensor officer. "Report—"  

"The *Cormorant* is in pursuit," the officer choked. "Burning at—" he faltered, mandibles twitching. "Burning at **impossible acceleration.**"  

Vrak's claws dug into his seat. **No. No, that made no sense.**  

Humans were **weak.** Their bodies **fragile.** They could not withstand prolonged acceleration the way Ryzak warriors could. Their vessels did not outmatch Ryzak in speed.  

So why—**WHY WERE THEY GAINING?!**  

On the tactical display, the distance was shrinking. **Too fast.**  

The *Cormorant* was gaining as if **the laws of physics did not apply to it.**  

Vrak snarled. "Turn! Bring weapons to bear—"  

His words died in his throat as he saw the human ship through the viewport, burning **straight toward them like a hunting beast.**  

They weren't **chasing.**  

They were **charging.**  

#### The End  

The human destroyer's railgun fired.  

Vrak barely had time to register the shot before the slug pierced through his ship's reactor core.  

There was no warning klaxon. No alarms. No time to react.  

For the briefest of moments, he saw the human vessel framed in a wall of fire, **barreling straight through the explosion** of his ship **as if it were nothing.**  

**And then, there was nothing.**
