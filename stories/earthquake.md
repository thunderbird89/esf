### Orbiting Federation Station Vigilance-3  
**High Geostationary Orbit - South China Sea**  

"Commander, sensors have picked up a large-scale seismic event in the South China Sea. Wave ETA is 25 minutes. On screen," the station AI, *Seraph*, chimed.  

Commander Elias Varrek turned from his station and faced the main holotable. A three-dimensional projection flickered into existence—an infrared map of the ocean floor. A violent rupture along a tectonic fault line, just south of Taiwan, pulsed in the readout. Bright arcs and trajectories calculated the tsunami’s spread, a sweeping cascade of destruction set to reach both Taiwan and China’s eastern seaboard in under half an hour.  

Varrek exhaled sharply. "Hmm, looks like both sides of the strait will be getting a pummeling soon. Do we have enough units and materiel on board to help both?"  

"Yes, sir," *Seraph* replied, its synthetic voice calm despite the urgency of the situation. "I am arranging a dispatch right now. Deploying two separate wings—one to Taiwan, one to Fujian province. Humanitarian priority."  

The display zoomed in, highlighting critical population centers at risk. Taipei. Kaohsiung. Xiamen. Fuzhou. Tens of millions of people. Too many to evacuate in time. The only viable option was direct intervention—before the waves swallowed the coasts.  

"Confirmed. Full stealth approach on descent. We do not need *either* side misinterpreting our arrival. Scramble relief teams."  

"Executing," *Seraph* acknowledged.  

From the underside of *Vigilance-3*, dark angular forms disengaged from their docking clamps. Dozens of medium and heavy dropships, their hulls painted in adaptive optical coatings, ghosted away from the station. Inside, Federation responders prepped for rapid deployment—exosuited medics, engineers, automated supply rigs, and modular emergency shelters. The ships accelerated downward, their plasma drives suppressing infrared signatures to avoid unnecessary attention.

### China’s Eastern Seaboard – Southern Theater Command Radar Facility  
**Fujian Province, Mainland China**  

Lieutenant Zhao Qiang was running on fumes. The tsunami alert had been issued barely twenty minutes ago, and every military and civil defense asset was scrambling to mobilize. He was hunched over the radar station, sweat pooling in the collar of his fatigues. The seismic activity alone had overwhelmed civilian infrastructure, and now reports were coming in—massive inbound waves already cresting past offshore islands.  

A new alert blipped onto his screen. Fast-moving aerial contacts. High altitude, multiple vectors.  

"Sir," Zhao called out to his superior, Major Wei. "Unknown aircraft descending rapidly from exo-atmospheric trajectories. Too many for ballistic debris, and they're not on any known commercial or military flight paths."  

Major Wei squinted at the screen. "Missiles?"  

"Negative. No hostile signatures. But their velocity… this isn’t normal. No standard aircraft descends that fast without breaking apart."  

Wei exchanged looks with the other officers. The People's Liberation Army Air Force was already stretched thin—airspace violations weren't exactly a priority with a natural disaster unfolding. Still, unidentified inbound craft *demanded* a response.  

"Keep tracking," Wei ordered. "If they break stealth, scramble interceptors."

### Republic of China Air Defense Command – Taipei  
**Northern Taiwan**  

Sergeant Lin Jiawei nearly spat out his tea. His radar display was a mess of static, distorted waves, and faint transponder echoes. Too faint. **Something** was descending fast, dropping below the ionosphere.  

He slammed his hand onto the comm panel. "We have unidentified atmospheric re-entry! Multiple contacts, no IFF!"  

A chorus of responses came through the comms, confused and tense. Taiwanese fighters were already rerouted inland due to tsunami response protocols. If these were enemy craft—China’s, perhaps?—there wouldn’t be enough air cover to intercept them.  

His screen refreshed. The contacts had slowed. **Not missiles. Not bombs. Something controlled.**  

Lin swallowed hard. "They’re landing… but where?"  

The unknowns fell toward the earth, just as the first tsunami waves began crashing into the coastline.

---

## The Watchers Descend  

### Taiwanese Air Defense Command – Taipei  

Sergeant Lin Jiawei’s hand hovered over the alert switch. His training screamed at him to call for an interception—the unidentified craft were descending in force. He opened his mouth to issue the order when the speakers crackled with a transmission.  

A voice.  

Cool. Measured. Feminine. Yet unmistakably synthetic.  

> *"ESF relief mission Arc Angel inbound to disaster zone. Do not engage. Repeat, ESF relief mission Arc Angel inbound to disaster zone. Do not engage."*  

Silence filled the command center. Every officer in the room exchanged bewildered looks. The voice spoke **flawless** Taiwanese, the formal register careful and respectful—like a diplomat speaking to a foreign delegation.  

“What the hell is *ESF*?” one officer murmured.  

“I don’t know,” Lin muttered. His fingers clenched into fists. “But they knew to use Taiwanese, not Mandarin. They knew we’d hear them.”  

Major Fang, the senior officer present, grimly studied the flight data streaming across their screens. The descending ships weren’t slowing down in a hostile maneuver. Instead, their vectors placed them directly in the most devastated areas—Taipei’s harbor, Kaohsiung’s flooded districts, and the coastal plains that had taken the brunt of the tsunami.  

“This… this isn’t a military incursion,” Fang said, almost to himself. “They’re landing in the worst-hit zones. Just… **dropping in**.”  

Lin felt the tension in his gut coil tighter. If this was some elaborate ruse, Taiwan’s crippled defense forces wouldn’t be able to respond in time. The tsunami had already destroyed key infrastructure, and the mainland was suffering just as badly. The entire Taiwan Strait was in chaos.  

He took a breath. “Sir, do we—”  

The radio crackled again.  

> *"Landing in ten. Commencing disaster relief."*  

Lin’s heart hammered in his chest as he watched the unknowns settle onto Taiwanese soil.

### Taipei – Disaster Zone, 10 Minutes After Landfall  

The first tsunami wave had struck with terrifying force. Seawater had surged through Taipei’s lower districts, swallowing buildings, vehicles, and the people trapped within. The once-bustling harbor was now an expanse of floating wreckage, bodies, and choked debris.  

And then, **they arrived**.  

From the roiling stormclouds above, **sleek black dropships** descended on pillars of blue-white plasma. Their dark hulls bore no markings of any known military, no insignia of any nation. They moved with an eerie precision, ignoring the chaos of panicked survivors who fled in every direction.  

The **first** to touch down was a towering, *spindly* vessel—its eight jointed legs unfurled with insect-like grace, stabilizing itself in the wreckage-strewn port district. From its segmented underbelly, a **large rectangular structure** was lowered with mechanical care. At first glance, it looked like nothing more than a **shipping container**, but as it settled, sections of its exterior unfolded—revealing satellite arrays, antenna clusters, and banks of glowing holo-displays.  

**A field command center.**  

Before anyone could process the sight, **heavy dropships** thundered down beside it, their massive rear ramps slamming open.  

Out strode **giants.**  

Ten-foot-tall **Landmates**—humanoid exosuits, their bulky armored frames gleaming under the flickering emergency lights of the ruined city. They moved with terrifying efficiency, their mechanical limbs powerful enough to **lift crushed vehicles** with ease. Beside them, **Goliaths**—far larger, their reverse-jointed legs giving them an almost alien appearance—marched into the wreckage, scanning for structural weaknesses before **tearing apart collapsed buildings to reach survivors**.  

And then came the **humans**.  

They wore unfamiliar armor—sleek, dark combat suits reinforced with high-tech plating. Helmets with opaque visors. They moved in tight, organized formations, their gear optimized for search-and-rescue rather than combat. Some carried stretchers and medical packs; others deployed drones that zipped away, scanning through the rubble for life signs.  

The lead unit’s **visor flickered**—a tactical heads-up display feeding real-time data.  

“**Sweep for survivors. Stabilize the wounded. Secure infrastructure before the next wave.**” The command was issued in **perfect** Taiwanese, transmitted through every emergency channel. “**We are here to help. Stay clear of the heavy units.**”  

Nearby, dazed civilians stared at the spectacle. Some gawked. Some **prayed**. Others, drenched and trembling, simply clung to the strangers in black armor—the first to reach them since the waves had struck.  

For the first time in a long, long while, **the Federation had arrived in full view of the world.**

### Fujian Province, Mainland China – Southern Theater Command Radar Facility  

Lieutenant Zhao Qiang’s hands tensed over his console. The unidentified aerial contacts were descending at speeds that no conventional aircraft should survive. He opened his mouth to call for an alert—Taiwan Strait tensions or not, unidentified objects dropping from exo-atmospheric altitudes warranted an immediate response.  

But before he could speak, the speakers **came to life**.  

A voice—calm, synthetic, unmistakably **feminine**.  

> *"ESF relief mission Guanyin is inbound to Fujian disaster area. Do not engage. Repeat: ESF relief mission Guanyin inbound to Fujian disaster area. Do not engage."*  

Zhao’s blood ran cold.  

The voice spoke in **flawless Mandarin**, precise yet **respectful** in tone. And the name—**Guanyin**, the goddess of mercy. This was **not** a military incursion. It was a **declaration** of intent.  

Major Wei and the other officers around him were already locking eyes, their confusion giving way to barely-contained alarm.  

“ESF?” Wei muttered, his face pale. “Who the hell is that?”  

“No idea,” Zhao answered. “But whoever they are, they have resources. And they’re already here.”  

On the radar screen, the **descending contacts slowed**—not crashing, not missiles, but **controlled landings**. The telemetry was **wrong** for anything they had ever seen. No re-entry burns. No heat signatures like traditional aircraft. These ships **ignored** conventional physics like some kind of **ghost fleet**.  

“They’re landing right in the tsunami impact zones,” another officer said, disbelief in his voice.  

Wei inhaled sharply. “If they wanted to attack, we’d already be dead.”  

Zhao swallowed, watching the screen as the first **shadowy craft** made contact with the flooded coastline.  

---

### Xiamen – Disaster Zone, 10 Minutes After Landfall  

The **first wave** had hit with devastating force. Xiamen’s bustling streets had become **raging rivers**, with water tearing through concrete and glass like paper. Thousands of buildings had crumbled, their skeletal remains jutting from the wreckage like broken ribs. Fires burned where gas lines had ruptured.  

And then, **the sky opened**.  

Dark, angular **dropships** descended on near-silent plasma thrusters, **completely ignoring** the battered airspace control grids. Their hulls shimmered with some kind of **adaptive coating**, shifting colors subtly as if rejecting attempts to lock onto them.  

The **first** to land was a **spindly, insectile vessel**, touching down on its eight **jointed mechanical legs** with eerie precision. A **massive rectangular object**—seemingly nothing more than a **shipping container**—was carefully lowered to the ground from its underbelly.  

Then the **sides of the “container” unfolded**.  

A **hardened field command center** took shape, satellite dishes and communications arrays extending like a blooming flower. The **flooded streets** around it lit up with faint blue-tinted emergency lights, **a signal beacon in the drowned city**.  

And then came the **giants**.  

**Heavy dropships** slammed down beside it, their ramp doors hissing open.  

Towering **Landmates**, **three meters tall**, emerged in perfect synchronicity, their armored frames **agile despite their bulk**. Each one moved **with eerie precision**, lifting shattered vehicles **as easily as toy cars** and tearing apart collapsed rubble **to reach survivors buried beneath**.  

And behind them, **Goliaths**—**five meters tall**, **quad-armored**, their **reverse-jointed legs crunching through debris**—began **tearing open buildings** with controlled force, clearing paths for emergency evacuations.  

**Then the humans arrived.**  

Sleek, **black-armored personnel** in unfamiliar **high-tech exosuits** fanned out in tight formations. Their equipment wasn’t built for war—it was optimized for **search-and-rescue**. Medics carried stretchers; engineers deployed **autonomous drones** that darted into the wreckage, scanning for life signs.  

One **visor-clad figure** stood at the center of the relief effort, their voice **broadcasting on all emergency channels in perfect Mandarin**.  

> *"We are here to help. Stay clear of the heavy units. Survivors, move toward safe zones. We will extract the trapped."*  

A drenched, trembling woman **collapsed into one of the rescuers’ arms**, clutching their armor **as if they were gods descending from heaven**.  

The Federation **had arrived on Chinese soil**.

## Command and Control

### Fujian Province – Several Hours After Landfall  

The Chinese military **arrived in force**.  

Convoys of **armored personnel carriers, supply trucks, and engineering vehicles** rumbled down the shattered highways toward the epicenter of the disaster. Helicopters buzzed overhead, their searchlights sweeping across the ruined cityscape. The air was thick with smoke, salt, and the unmistakable stench of brackish floodwater mixed with the devastation of collapsed infrastructure.  

At the head of the convoy, General **Huang Weizhong** sat in his command vehicle, gripping the armrest with white-knuckled tension. He had expected **absolute chaos**—civilians screaming for help, bodies strewn through the wreckage, an overwhelmed rescue effort struggling to get organized.  

Instead, he found… **order**.  

**Too much order.**  

His convoy approached a **well-secured perimeter**, marked not by the usual panicked checkpoints of a struggling relief effort, but by **tall, armored figures** standing in perfect formation. **Landmates.**  

The **ten-foot-tall machines** stood motionless at first, their reflective black visors hiding whatever sensors lay within. As the convoy slowed, the **exosuits turned in eerie synchronization**, their movements as fluid as trained infantry. One of them **gestured**, directing the military convoy **not into the ruined city**, but along a **cleared, reinforced road**—one that **should not have been there**.  

General Huang's eyes narrowed. "What in the world...?"  

His staff officers were equally bewildered. "Sir, this—this isn’t possible. This level of organization—*"谁做到的?"* (Who could have done this?)  

Huang didn’t have an answer. The roads had **already been cleared**. The most devastated areas had **mobile triage stations**, **modular shelters**, and even **supply chains** being funneled into the worst-hit districts.  

To his eyes, it looked as though **the relief effort had been ongoing for weeks**—not mere hours.  

His jaw clenched. **This wasn’t China’s doing.**  

"Bring us to their command center," he ordered.  

The Landmates didn’t react to the sudden arrival of the **People’s Liberation Army** in their disaster zone. They simply **gestured the convoy through**.  

That, more than anything, unsettled General Huang. **Who the hell were these people?**  

---

### Federation Field Command Center – Fujian  

The **spindly insect-like ship** that had deployed the **command hub** still loomed over the center of operations, its jointed mechanical legs **planted firmly** in the ruined earth. At its base, **holo-displays flickered**, monitoring every sector of the relief effort.  

At the heart of it all, **Sergeant Nathaniel Travers** stood with his arms crossed, scanning the tactical readouts.  

He heard the **thudding of approaching boots** before he saw them.  

A dozen PLA officers, flanking a **fuming General Huang Weizhong**, stormed into the command area.  

Travers barely spared them a glance.  

"Sergeant!" Huang’s voice boomed. "I want an **immediate** explanation for this incursion into **sovereign Chinese territory**!"  

Travers **turned** to face him, his expression unreadable. He wasn't an imposing figure—**not compared to the hulking Landmates or the towering Goliaths**. But something in his **stance**, his **confidence**, made it clear that this wasn’t a man to be **intimidated**.  

"General," Travers said, his tone flat, unreadable.  

Huang stepped closer, towering over him. "Do you need to be reminded that you are on **sovereign Chinese soil, Sergeant**?"  

Travers’s **eyes locked onto his**.  

"Do you need to be reminded," Travers said, his voice **low** and **cold**, "that we have **complete control over the field while your men are dawdling around**? Either fall in line or get out of our way, because if you don't move, you **will be moved**. *General*."  

The room went **dead silent**.  

A *PLA officer twitched* toward his sidearm. A Landmate **twitched back**—its mechanical fingers flexing with an unmistakable **threat**.  

For a moment, Huang’s face **flushed red**. No one spoke to him like that. **No one**.  

And yet—  

His eyes flicked to the holo-displays. The readouts. The **real-time coordination** of every sector of the city. His own forces had **just arrived**, struggling with logistics, organizing relief. **These people?** They had already **established a fully operational disaster relief network.**  

He exhaled.  

"*天啊*," he muttered under his breath. *(Heaven help me.)*  

Then, with **deliberate care**, he took a step back.  

"...Very well," he said. "Then we will do things **your way**, Sergeant."  

Travers **nodded**—just once.  

Immediately, his stance **shifted**. His voice **lost its edge**.  

"Good," Travers said. "Then let’s stop wasting time. We need your manpower and supply lines integrated into the network. My teams will send you direct assignments."  

Huang barely had time to process the **sudden shift** before Travers **tapped his comms**.  

“All units, update: **PLA command is cooperating. Chinese forces are now integrated into relief ops.** Adjust accordingly.”  

Across the entire **Federation network**, the algorithms adjusted—Chinese convoys **were rerouted**, **integrated into the logistics chain**, and PLA engineering teams were **dispatched to reinforce** the Federation’s infrastructure.  

It was **seamless**.  

Huang stared at the operation unfolding before him.  

The sheer **efficiency** of it sent chills down his spine.  

Who the **hell** were these people? And how—**how**—had they managed to build **all this** so fast?  

For the first time, he truly realized the scope of what had just **touched down on Chinese soil**.

### Taipei – Republic of China Military Command Post  

The skies over Taipei were still **choked with smoke**, but the worst of the chaos had begun to settle. Where there had been devastation, **order** was rapidly taking hold. The **deadliest aftermath** of the tsunami—fires, collapsing structures, and stranded survivors—was already being **systematically handled** by the **Federation’s intervention**.  

And for **Major-General Chen Mingwei**, that was nothing short of a miracle.  

As his **military convoy** rolled into the Federation’s field command center—a stark, **modular structure** that looked more **industrial** than military—he saw what **should have been impossible**.  

Federation **Landmates and Goliaths** were clearing rubble at **inhuman speeds**. Drone swarms were sweeping through the ruins, marking **every survivor, every hazard**, and **routing medical teams with perfect precision**. Civilian relief workers—already in shock from the disaster—were now in **awe** of the **shadowy soldiers and towering machines** that had materialized to **save them**.  

At the center of it all stood **Sergeant Eliza Walter**.  

She was **younger** than Chen expected—**mid-30s, maybe?**—with short-cut brown hair and the kind of **practical, hardened demeanor** that only came from a life spent in the field. She wasn’t **barking orders** or **issuing demands**—she was speaking **calmly**, directing her units with **complete control** over the chaos unfolding around her.  

She turned as he approached, offering a **firm nod**.  

"Major-General," she said in **flawless Mandarin**, her voice carrying a respectful tone.  

Chen extended his hand immediately, and Walter **shook it without hesitation**.  

"Sergeant Walter," he said, exhaling. "I don’t know where you came from or how you got here so fast, but Taiwan is in your debt. **Truly.**"  

Walter gave him a **small, professional smile**.  

"We go where we're needed," she said simply. "And right now, that means here."  

Chen nodded, glancing around at the **vast operation** unfolding in **real-time**. It was clear, **crystal clear**, that his own forces were **outpaced**. The Federation wasn’t **just helping**—they had already taken **command** of the relief effort. And **he wasn’t about to fight that**.  

"I won’t waste your time, Sergeant," Chen said. "Our forces are at your disposal. Just tell us what needs to be done."  

Walter’s **expression shifted**—subtle, but unmistakable.  

She had been **ready for resistance**. Instead, she found **cooperation**.  

And that, more than anything, meant the difference between **conflict and unity**.  

"Glad to hear it," Walter said. She turned, motioning to one of her field officers. "We’ll need your engineering corps reinforcing structural weak points in sectors four through six. Medical teams should coordinate with our field medics—we have mobile triage running 24/7, and priority treatment lists are already established. Your transport assets can focus on evacuation of at-risk zones—we’ll provide real-time updates as we stabilize each district."  

Chen **nodded without hesitation**.  

"Understood. Consider it done."  

Walter’s **stance relaxed slightly**.  

This was going to work. **They were going to save thousands—maybe millions—together.**  

She turned to her team. "All units—**Taiwanese command is cooperating. Integrate them into the relief ops immediately.** Adjust accordingly."  

Across the Federation’s **network**, new **pathways** opened up. Taiwanese convoys were immediately **routed into the Federation's supply chain**. Military search-and-rescue units were assigned **to areas already marked for priority retrieval**.  

The **Republic of China’s military** had just become a **seamless part** of the **Federation’s intervention force**.  

As the first **joint teams** moved out—Federation soldiers and Taiwanese troops side by side—**Chen met Walter’s gaze once more.**  

"One last thing, Sergeant," he said, his voice quieter. "Who… are you people?"  

Walter gave him a **knowing smirk**.  

"We are the Federation" she said simply.  

And then she **turned back to the mission**.

### Taipei – Live News Broadcast  

The **cameraman struggled to keep the shot steady** as he and his team waded through ankle-deep floodwater, weaving between displaced civilians and emergency responders. Smoke still lingered in the air from scattered fires, and the distant wail of sirens was a constant backdrop to the **unfolding crisis**.  

Standing amidst the devastation, **Cheng Yiru**, a field reporter for TBC News, **adjusted her earpiece** as the anchor in the studio patched her through.  

*"We’re live in three, two—"*  

She **straightened**, holding the mic with practiced steadiness.  

*"This is Cheng Yiru, reporting from the heart of Taipei, where disaster relief efforts are in full force. But what is most astonishing—what no one could have anticipated—is the presence of an **unknown humanitarian force** that has seemingly appeared out of **nowhere** to assist in rescue operations."*  

The **camera panned upward**, focusing on **small black drones** darting through the shattered remains of collapsed buildings. **Faint blue lights flickered on their undersides**, and every few seconds, a **sharp electronic chirp** sounded as one of them hovered over a **specific location**, projecting **a red targeting laser onto the rubble**.  

**Then came the machines.**  

The camera **jerked as the ground trembled**—massive, **humanoid figures** strode through the ruins, their towering metallic forms moving **with unsettling grace**. The machines moved toward each **marked** area, their **multi-jointed arms** gripping jagged concrete slabs and **tearing them apart as though they were paper**.  

The first **recovered survivor** emerged—a **young girl, no older than ten**, coughing weakly as a **massive mechanical hand carefully lifted her from the wreckage**.  

*"Oh my God,"* Yiru whispered, momentarily breaking from her professional tone.  

The camera **zoomed in** as **human responders—wearing sleek black uniforms with opaque visors—rushed forward with a stretcher**, taking the girl from the machine’s grasp. Within moments, a **medic was at her side**, administering oxygen while another scanned her with **some kind of handheld device**.  

*"These unidentified rescue teams are working with stunning efficiency,"* Yiru continued, regaining her composure. *"They have deployed **drones that locate survivors**, and these… these enormous machines are then **digging them out with incredible precision.**"*  

The camera panned to another scene—one of the **metal giants effortlessly lifting the remains of a collapsed bus**, revealing **a cluster of trapped civilians inside**. They were **covered in dust and debris, dazed but alive**. As the responders **helped them out**, the massive machine **stepped back, already turning to its next target**.  

---

### Elsewhere in the City – Emergency Shelters  

*"As the rescue teams continue to extract survivors,"* Yiru’s voiceover continued, *"other units have set up emergency shelters, providing **food, water, and medical aid** to those displaced by the disaster."*  

The footage cut to a **crowded relief zone**—**rows of temporary shelters and medical tents** were being assembled by both **human and mechanical hands**.  

One of the **armored figures**—clearly **human**, though still **clad in unfamiliar gear**—stood at a supply station, **handing out meal rations** to a line of shivering evacuees.  

The **cameraman zoomed in** as one of the civilians—an **elderly woman clutching a soaked blanket**—was approached by one of the **massive machines**. The crowd around her **tensed**, fearful of the towering figure.  

Instead, the **giant carefully knelt down**, extending a **thermal blanket** from a storage compartment on its back. It **wrapped the blanket gently around her shoulders** before standing again and **moving on without a word**.  

A mother **held her crying child**, clearly in shock. One of the **black-armored responders** knelt down, offering them a **bottle of water and a ration bar** before speaking in **calm, reassuring Mandarin**.  

*"They’re… helping,"* a displaced man in the background whispered, his voice barely picked up by the mic. *"They’re really… just here to help."*  

Yiru exhaled.  

*"Whatever these people are—wherever they came from—one thing is clear."*  

The camera focused on the **order unfolding within the chaos**—the wounded being **treated**, the hungry being **fed**, the terrified being **comforted**.  

*"They may have come from the shadows… but today, they stand in the light."*

---

### Fujian Province – Live News Broadcast  

The **PLA armored personnel carrier** came to a halt just outside the ruins of a collapsed apartment complex. The air was **thick with dust**, the ground soaked with **saltwater and debris**. The wreckage of what had once been **a thriving city** now lay in **ruins**, the aftermath of the tsunami still **raw and overwhelming**.  

And yet, there was **order in the chaos**.  

Liang Xun, a field reporter for **CCTV**, stood with a **hand to his earpiece**, nodding as the studio anchor cued him in. The **cameraman** beside him adjusted his shot, trying to frame both the unfolding relief effort **and the astonishing presence of the mysterious rescuers**.  

*"This is Liang Xun, reporting from the disaster zone in Fujian Province. Hours after the tsunami struck, the relief effort is well underway, but what is **most unexpected** is the presence of an **unknown, highly advanced force** assisting in the rescue operations."*  

The **camera feed cut to the wreckage** of a shopping district, where a **small swarm of black, disc-shaped drones** flitted through the air, **scanning the debris**. Their **blue lights flickered**, chirping every time they **locked onto a heat signature**.  

Then, from the thick haze of dust and destruction, **the giants appeared**.  

**Humanoid machines, nearly three meters tall,** strode through the wreckage like **metal titans**, their mechanical limbs moving with **unsettling fluidity**. They **descended upon the marked locations**, gripping **entire slabs of concrete** in their **multi-jointed arms** and **hurling them aside as though they were weightless**.  

A **PLA soldier standing nearby flinched**, instinctively reaching for his rifle. His superior **stopped him with a sharp glance**, shaking his head. *Not now.*  

The camera **zoomed in** as one of the machines lifted an **entire crumpled car**, revealing a **survivor trapped beneath it**. The person, a **young man covered in dust and blood**, coughed weakly as a **black-armored figure—a human, this time—rushed in to pull him free**.  

*"What you’re seeing is unlike anything we’ve encountered before,"* Liang continued. *"These unidentified forces are not only using advanced technology to locate survivors, but they are also engaging in direct rescue operations—moving debris, stabilizing the injured, and coordinating medical response with **unprecedented speed**."*  

---

### Elsewhere in Fujian – Emergency Shelters and Supply Distribution  

The **camera feed shifted**, cutting to an **emergency relief center** on the outskirts of the disaster zone. Rows of **prefabricated medical tents** had been set up, and **groups of civilians**—many still in shock, others suffering from injuries—were being **escorted inside by black-armored personnel**.  

At one of the **food distribution stations**, **PLA troops and the unidentified forces** worked **side by side**, though their cooperation was **visibly tense**.  

A **Chinese soldier, clad in standard-issue fatigues**, handed out **bottled water** to a line of displaced families. Standing beside him, a **black-visored Federation soldier** did the same, offering **ration packs** in perfect Mandarin:  

*"You’re safe here. Food and water are available inside the shelters."*  

The **camera zoomed in on a subtle moment**—a **PLA soldier hesitated** as his counterpart from the Federation moved to assist an elderly woman struggling with a crate of supplies.  

For a moment, it seemed like **instinctual distrust** would take over.  

Then, with **visible reluctance**, the **Chinese soldier stepped forward**, lifting the other side of the crate.  

They **carried it together.**  

It was a small thing. But it spoke volumes.  

*"Despite the obvious tensions between the two groups,"* Liang narrated, *"the PLA forces and the mysterious rescuers are working together to provide aid. Whatever mistrust exists, it is being **set aside in the face of a greater crisis.**"*  

The feed cut again—to a **Federation medical team stabilizing a critically injured woman**, their **handheld devices flashing with medical readouts**, their voices calm as they worked.  

A **PLA medic crouched beside them**, watching how they worked. His **expression was hard to read**—a mix of **fascination, suspicion, and reluctant admiration**.  

And then, almost without realizing it, he **began assisting**.  

The Federation medics didn’t question it. They simply **adjusted their work to accommodate him, seamlessly integrating his help into their own efforts.**  

---

### Back to the Newsroom  

*"What we are witnessing here is something **unprecedented**,"* Liang concluded. *"A rescue effort unlike any before. Whoever these unknown forces are, they have already **saved hundreds—perhaps thousands—of lives** in the span of just a few short hours."*  

The camera lingered on **one final image**—a young girl, wrapped in a **thermal blanket**, sitting beside her father as they were handed **hot meals** by a black-armored responder.  

*"The world will want answers about who they are."*  

*"But today, for the people of Fujian, the only thing that matters—"*  

*"—is that they came."*

---

### Fujian Province – Live News Broadcast  

*"This is Liang Xun, reporting from the disaster zone in Fujian Province, where relief efforts continue to defy all expectations."*  

The **camera panned upward**, capturing the **smoke-filled sky** above the ruined city. Fires still burned in some districts, and the skeletal remains of **shattered skyscrapers** loomed over the devastation.  

And then—**something impossible**.  

A **hulking aircraft** hovered in mid-air, **suspended effortlessly** beside a **critically damaged skyscraper**. It was **unlike any helicopter or drone** Liang had ever seen—its sleek, angular hull had an almost **organic quality**, its engines mounted on **swiveling thrusters** that pulsed with a faint **blue glow**.  

*"We are now witnessing what appears to be an **aerial extraction operation**,"* Liang narrated, his voice barely concealing his **astonishment**.  

The **cameraman zoomed in**, focusing on a **makeshift bridge** extending from the hovering craft to the **fractured remains of the skyscraper’s upper floors**.  

And on that bridge—**civilians.**  

They were **frightened, some injured**, but under the direction of **black-armored figures**, they moved **with urgency but not panic**.  

The **aircraft was holding steady**, compensating for the **tremors** rocking the building, as though **it had predicted the collapse before it even began**.  

Then—**a deep, shuddering groan**.  

The **building tilted.**  

The **camera shook** as the skyscraper’s upper structure **buckled**, glass and steel raining down onto the ruins below.  

*"Oh—oh no—"* Liang gasped.  

But the **mystery aircraft reacted instantly.**  

The **bridge retracted in seconds**, the final civilians **hauled inside by unseen hands**. The aircraft **angled sharply**, its thrusters roaring as it **pulled back just in time**—a fraction of a second before the **entire upper section of the skyscraper gave way**, collapsing into a **massive plume of dust and debris**.  

The **camera tried to follow the aircraft**, but it was already **rising, banking away from the destruction**, moving with a **grace no known aircraft should have possessed**.  

*"Incredible,"* Liang whispered, almost forgetting the live broadcast.  

*"This… whatever this craft is, it just executed a near-impossible **mid-air rescue**, extracting trapped civilians from an **unstable structure** moments before its total collapse."*  

The feed zoomed in once more, catching the **aircraft disappearing into the sky**, its **passengers now safe**.  

The **last image** before the smoke obscured it was the **silhouette of the unknown craft**, its thrusters shifting as it **vanished beyond the ruined skyline**.  

Liang turned back to the camera, **still in shock**, his hands **visibly trembling** as he adjusted his mic.  

*"Whoever these people are…"* he exhaled, struggling to find his words.  

*"They do the impossible."*
