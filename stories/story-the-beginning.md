## 1947-07-07T23:34:16-06:00, Roswell, New Mexico

Sergeant Nathaniel Summers stood on the rim of the crater with his torch scanning the scene before him. He hadn't the slightest clue about what he was seeing, other than knowing he was severely out of his depth. As a soldier, he was trained to confront the unexpected, but nothing in boot camp or his service manuals had prepared him for this. When he saw the shooting star half an hour earlier and made his wish to be someone notable, he never actually expected it to come true. Then came the shockwave and the thunder.

Nathaniel drove his jeep in the direction he saw the shooting star land as fast as it could go over the New Mexico desert. When he arrived at the crater, the fires were starting to die down. He carefully made his way to the rim of the crater and looked down at the metallic object within - a few fires were still burning over it here and there, but mostly it was just smoldering quietly.  
He did the only sensible thing he could come up with: grabbed the radio in his jeep, and called it in.

He nervously walked back to the crater, and shone his torch down at the bottom again. The object at the bottom was charred, a large chunk of it was missing, like something inside exploded outwards. It reminded Sgt. Summers of the manta rays he saw in his son's school books - it had a thicker cylindrical middle section that tapered out to both sides into what looked like wings. It must have been 10-15 meters long, and almost equally wide, though he could not guess how much of it was lost in its descent. Its surface was blackened from intense heat, but in some places, dull dark grey coloration was visible - he guessed it was the original surface color that survived the violent crash. As he scanned the wreck with his light, he muttered under his breath.

"What have I gotten myself into? And did I *really* have to make that wish...?"

General John Haytham was seated in the ready room of the small airfield that suddenly lit up on the leadership's radar. He spent the better part of the early morning flying and driving in, and he had to admit his body was not used to that any more. He sipped the coffee and muttered a thanks to the young NC lady. Across the table sat the base commander, an engineer, and two scientists in white lab coats.

> "So let me get this straight: you're saying you haven't the slightest clue as to what that hell that thing in your hangar is, only that it's not from around here. Is that what you're saying?" - he growled at Colonel Blanchard - "And you flew me out here to middle of nowhere to tell me that?"

> "General, let me rephrase that in another way: we definitely know it's not ours, and we're quite sure it's not a Soviet contraption either. Or if it is, we're in deep trouble. Either way, I think what Dr. Platchett here is trying to say is that it's ... not from Earth at all, and I tend to agree with him. We think it came from out there..." - he waved a hand towards the ceiling.

> "Hm. Private ... Stevens, you're an engineer. What do you think?"

> "Sir, I would agree with the doctor here. I've seen the reports of Soviet fighters we recovered, and this ... this is nothing like it. Like, I don't know Russian aside from vodka but I know machines. Or at least I thought I did, because I can't see anything even remotely familiar on this thing. Except..." - he trailed off, unsure if he should finish.

> "Except...? Out with it, private!"

> "Sir, there's a light that's been flashing ever since we brought it in. I can't make heads or tails of the writing, but it's flashing red and yellow, one flash a second, constantly. I saw something like this over at the Navy - I think it's a distress beacon, sir..."

## 1947-07-12T03:26:44-06:00, Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico

The vessel hovered silently above the airfield, oblivious to the blaring klaxons underneath. The commander on the vessel's bridge observed the commotion on their viewscreens. It saw that the natives were frantically trying to communicate outwards, using radio frequencies, but the crew has already jammed all communications. They were sent to do one thing, recover a scout that suffered an accident and crashed, but now, observing the natives, the commander made a decision under his own authority.

> "Zreth'lar Kon'tak Prot'la Xinit'kha, Seren'vah."

The bridge crew looked at the commander quizzically. It nodded. One of the crew typed a few commands into their console, and glyphs began to stream in dense clusters.

A hatch opened on the underside of the vessel, and a small pod descended, landing in the middle of the airfield. The MPs surrounded it with their guns trained - they had no idea what was happening, but they knew their duty and their training, and they were ready to apply it if needed.A high-pitched whine started to rise from the pod, until everyone felt their ears ring, their guns vibrate in their hands, and their teeth itch in their mouth, before it suddenly stopped. Into the silence, a female voice spoke with a Southern accent.

> "Please. Don't shoot. I come in peace. I want to speak to General John Haytham, Private Michael Stevens, and Dr. Robert Platchett. I mean no harm."

The MPs looked at each other cautiously, then at their commanding officer. The officer motioned to one of his soldiers.

> "Get the egghead first. And prepare the General for evac if needed. Go."

## 1947-07-12T07:15:22-06:00, Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico

General Haytham stood behind reinforced glass, watching the alien figure move with deliberate care around the hangar. The being had emerged from its pod three hours ago, and every moment since had been a carefully orchestrated dance of mistrust and curiosity. Two dozen soldiers maintained perimeter positions while scientists observed from a safe distance.

The alien—Thel'zar, it had called itself—approached the wreckage of the crashed scout vessel with what appeared to be reverence. Its elongated fingers traced patterns in the air above the twisted metal, and occasionally it would pause to examine sections more closely.

> "General, it's been scanning our personnel files somehow," Dr. Platchett approached quietly. "Every person it requested by name—they're all key to our analysis of the craft. Stevens identified the propulsion signatures, you authorized the recovery, I've been leading the materials analysis."

> "How the hell could it know that?"

> "I don't think it's reading our minds, if that's what you're worried about. But it clearly has access to information we don't understand. Look at this." Platchett held up a metal tablet covered in flowing symbols. "It gave this to Stevens an hour ago. Best we can tell, it's a technical manual."

Haytham studied the symbols, which seemed to shift slightly when he wasn't looking directly at them. "Technical manual for what?"

> "The crashed ship. Stevens says it's showing him how the power systems work. General, this technology... it's decades beyond anything we have. Maybe centuries."

Through the glass, they watched Thel'zar carefully lift a fragment of the scout craft and place it in what appeared to be a repair device—a small cylinder that hummed with barely audible energy. The fragment began to reshape itself, metal flowing like liquid until it matched the alien's undamaged components.

> "It's fixing our prisoner," Haytham muttered.

> "No sir," Stevens approached, holding the symbol-covered tablet. "It's showing us how to fix it. Every repair it makes, it explains the process through this... thing. It's teaching us."

## 1947-07-14T16:42:11-06:00, Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico

The relationship had shifted. Where armed guards once stood, now technicians worked alongside the alien in a makeshift laboratory. Thel'zar moved between workstations with fluid grace, occasionally pausing to correct a human's technique or demonstrate a more efficient approach.

Colonel Blanchard found General Haytham reviewing a stack of reports in the base commander's office. Outside the window, they could see the alien working with a team of engineers on what appeared to be a communications device.

> "Sir, Washington is getting antsy. They want to know when we're moving this... situation... to a more secure facility."

> "Tell Washington that our 'situation' just solved our radar blind spot problem and showed us how to increase our aircraft engine efficiency by thirty percent." Haytham set down a technical report filled with diagrams he barely understood. "Stevens says it's also working on something that could revolutionize our materials science."

> "With respect, General, we don't know its motives. For all we know, this could be reconnaissance for an invasion."

Haytham looked out the window where Thel'zar was patiently showing Private Stevens how to calibrate some impossible-looking device. "If they wanted to invade, Colonel, they wouldn't need reconnaissance. You've seen what that small ship could do before it crashed. Imagine what an intact fleet could accomplish."

> "Then what does it want?"

> "That's what I intend to find out."

## 1947-07-16T19:33:05-06:00, Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico

The evening briefing had become a daily ritual. Haytham, Blanchard, Dr. Platchett, and Stevens gathered in the hangar's converted conference room while Thel'zar shared what it called "contextual information" about the galaxy beyond Earth.

The alien manipulated a device that projected three-dimensional star maps in the air between them. Points of light indicated inhabited systems, with flowing lines showing trade routes and territorial boundaries.

> "Your species stands at a critical threshold," Thel'zar explained, its mechanical voice carrying an oddly warm undertone. "You have achieved nuclear fission and are beginning to explore beyond your atmosphere. These are the traditional markers for contact eligibility."

> "Contact eligibility?" Dr. Platchett leaned forward. "You mean there are rules?"

> "Not rules. Protocols. Developed over millennia by species like yours that survived their technological adolescence." The star map shifted, highlighting systems marked in red. "Many do not. The transition from planetary to interplanetary civilization is... precarious."

General Haytham studied the display. "And you're here to help us make that transition?"

> "If your people choose to accept guidance. The Terran Advisory Council has been observing your development for several decades. Your recent global conflict demonstrated both your species' capacity for destruction and your ability to eventually choose cooperation over annihilation."

> "Advisory Council?" Stevens looked up from the notes he'd been frantically scribbling. "There are more of you?"

> "Many more. Representing various species that have successfully navigated this transition. We do not seek to control or conquer—we seek to prevent the mistakes that have destroyed countless civilizations before reaching the stars."

The room fell silent except for the soft humming of alien technology. Finally, Haytham spoke.

> "What do you need from us?"

> "Partners. Representatives of your species who can work within your existing power structures while gradually preparing your civilization for the larger galactic community. It will take generations. But it must begin somewhere."

## 1947-07-20T11:15:33-06:00, Pentagon, Washington D.C.

General Haytham stood before a closed session of military leadership, holding a briefing folder that would reshape American defense strategy. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal sat at the head of the table, flanked by the Joint Chiefs and select intelligence officials.

> "Gentlemen, what I'm about to share with you cannot leave this room. What we have in New Mexico represents either the greatest opportunity or the greatest threat in human history."

He opened the folder and removed a photograph of Thel'zar working alongside human technicians.

> "This individual represents an advanced civilization that has been observing our development. They're offering technological cooperation and guidance, but they want something in return—a formal partnership structure that can operate both within and beyond our existing government frameworks."

Secretary Forrestal studied the photograph intently. "And you believe this offer is genuine?"

> "Sir, in eight days they've advanced our understanding of metallurgy by decades, solved three critical engineering problems with our new jet designs, and provided us with communications technology that makes our best equipment look like telegraph keys. If this is deception, it's the most generous deception in history."

> "What exactly are they proposing?"

> "A shadow organization. Officially non-governmental, but with access to resources and personnel from major world powers. They want to establish formal contact with selected representatives from each major nation, not just us."

The room erupted in quiet but intense discussion. Admiral Nimitz leaned back in his chair.

> "You're talking about bringing in the Russians. The British. The French. People we were shooting at two years ago."

> "Admiral, according to our new friend, if we don't learn to cooperate on this level, we won't survive long enough to matter. They've seen it happen before."

## 1947-07-22T14:27:18-06:00, Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico

Thel'zar had modified the communications equipment again, this time creating what appeared to be a secure channel for long-range transmission. General Haytham watched as encrypted messages flowed to carefully selected recipients around the globe.

> "Your leaders have agreed to the preliminary contact framework," Thel'zar announced. "Representatives from seven nations will arrive within the next four days. I suggest we relocate to a more neutral venue."

> "Fort Worth," Haytham replied. "Bigger airfield, more security, and far enough from here to maintain operational security."

> "Acceptable. I will need to contact my ship to arrange for additional materials and translational aids. Some of your guests will require more extensive briefing than others."

Dr. Platchett looked up from a device he'd been studying. "Thel'zar, why now? You said you've been observing us for decades. Why make contact now?"

The alien paused in its work, turning to face the humans with what might have been a thoughtful expression.

> "Truthfully, our timeline was accelerated by circumstances beyond our control. The scout vessel's malfunction forced our hand—we could not simply abandon the pilot or allow your people to reverse-engineer technology you are not prepared for. But there are... other factors."

General Haytham leaned forward. "Other factors?"

> "Your species is approaching several technological thresholds simultaneously. Nuclear weapons, rocket propulsion, electronic computation, radar systems. History shows that civilizations reaching these developments together either transcend to become spacefaring species, or they destroy themselves within a generation. We prefer the former outcome."

> "But more urgently," Thel'zar continued, its voice taking on a more serious tone, "your rapid technological advancement has not gone unnoticed by others in the galaxy. Not all spacefaring civilizations share our philosophy of gradual guidance and cooperative development."

The room grew quiet. Stevens stopped taking notes.

> "You're saying there are others out there who might not be as... diplomatic as you?" Dr. Platchett asked carefully.

> "There are those who view emerging civilizations as either resources to be exploited or threats to be eliminated before they can develop interstellar capabilities. Your nuclear weapons, in particular, represent a significant milestone that attracts... attention."

> "And if we choose isolation? If we decide we don't want galactic contact?"

> "Then we withdraw and hope you prove the exception to a very consistent pattern. But withdrawal becomes increasingly difficult as your technology advances, and more importantly, as other parties take interest in your development. Contact becomes inevitable. The question is whether it happens on cooperative terms or through... less favorable circumstances."

General Haytham absorbed this, understanding the implicit message. "How long do we have to decide?"

> "The preliminary contact phase allows for extensive evaluation by both sides. But your nuclear weapons programs suggest you will reach critical decision points within the next decade. After that, the window for guided transition closes."

## 1947-07-26T13:58:53-06:00, Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas

The base's ready room was packed. Generals, engineers, scientists, diplomats, businessmen, representing all major powers on the globe. People were marched out of university lectures or board meetings, or were made offers they could not refuse to get them to come along. Eventually, all flights led to Texas, and everyone was waiting for what was about to happen, eyeing each other cautiously - after all, no matter how enticing the offer, a Russian general will have a hard time not reaching for his service weapon when in the same room as his American counterpart, even if said weapon is safe in a locker.

At 14:00:00 exactly, the door to the ready room opened, and in walked the strangest being they ever saw.The thing was short, at most 160 cm, built of long limbs and a slender torso, but possessing a wiry build that looked like an athlete. Its body was mostly covered by a tight, silvery suit, but its skin was a light bluish color, and its large eyes glimmered like that of an insect. Over its face, it wore a mask-like devices that pulsed slowly with a blue light around a filter. It stopped a few steps from the crowd, and craned its head around, looking at each face, taking a breath. When it spoke, it spoke with an unplaceable accent in its slightly mechanic-sounding voice.

A palpable tension filled the room. Some leaned forward in intrigue, while others recoiled slightly, their faces a mix of fear and fascination. If the alien noticed, it paid no heed to the reactions.

> "Thank you for coming. My name is Thel'zar Seren-Luna'ki. You, in this room, have been selected as our first contact community. You will be our extensions on this planet, our eyes and our hands. You will help elevate your civilization to walk among the stars with others. That is your task from now. I will assist you in this."

## 1947-07-26T14:15:32-06:00, Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas

General Alexei Petrov of the Soviet Union was the first to break the stunned silence that followed Thel'zar's introduction.

> "This is elaborate American propaganda," he declared in heavily accented English, his weathered face showing deep skepticism. "Hollywood special effects to justify new military expenditures."

Several heads nodded around the room. British Air Commodore Geoffrey Whitman straightened his uniform. "I must admit, this seems rather convenient timing, given recent tensions."

Thel'zar regarded the Soviet general with what might have been amusement. "General Petrov, you commanded the 3rd Guards Tank Army during the Battle of Kursk. Your tactical innovations in armored warfare saved approximately fourteen thousand lives in that engagement alone."

Petrov's face went pale. "That information is classified at the highest levels."

> "Dr. Li Wei," Thel'zar continued, turning to the Chinese physicist, "your recent work on electromagnetic field theory has brought you very close to understanding quantum entanglement, though you lack the mathematical framework to complete the calculations."

Dr. Li's eyes widened. "I have not published that research. Only three people know of it."

> "Professor Schmidt, your analysis of jet propulsion efficiency could be improved by seventeen percent with a simple modification to the combustion chamber geometry. Would you like me to show you?"

Karl Schmidt from Berlin University leaned forward despite himself. "Show me."

Thel'zar manipulated a small device, and suddenly a three-dimensional hologram appeared in the center of the room - a detailed cutaway of a jet engine with flowing lines indicating air patterns and combustion dynamics.

> "The modification involves creating controlled vortices here and here," Thel'zar explained, highlighting sections of the projection. "Your current designs create turbulence that wastes approximately eighteen percent of your fuel energy."

The room fell completely silent as even the most skeptical observers found themselves studying the holographic display.

## 1947-07-26T15:47:21-06:00, Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas

Two hours into the demonstration, the atmosphere had shifted dramatically. What began as mutual suspicion had transformed into collaborative fascination. Soviet General Petrov found himself comparing notes with American Admiral Chester Nimitz over a holographic display of advanced metallurgy techniques.

> "If we could apply this tempering process to our submarine hulls..." Nimitz mused.

> "Da, and our tank armor could be thirty percent lighter with same protection," Petrov replied, then caught himself fraternizing with his supposed enemy. But the implications of what they were seeing overshadowed old animosities.

Nearby, Japanese diplomat Takayama Nakamura watched French physicist Marie Dubois and British engineer Sir Reginald Thornley debate the theoretical implications of the alien power generation systems.

> "The energy density is impossible by our current understanding," Dubois protested.

> "That's rather the point, isn't it?" Thornley replied. "We're looking at technology that makes our entire industrial base obsolete overnight."

Thel'zar moved between groups, answering questions and providing clarifications. When Italian engineer Giuseppe Marcelli asked about materials science, the alien produced a small metallic sample.

> "This alloy contains elements not found in your periodic table. It maintains structural integrity at temperatures that would vaporize steel, yet remains flexible at absolute zero."

Marcelli held the sample with trembling hands. "The applications... this could revolutionize everything from aircraft design to architecture."

> "Indeed. But your civilization must be ready to handle such advances responsibly."

## 1947-07-26T17:23:16-06:00, Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas

By late afternoon, former enemies were working together with an enthusiasm that would have been unthinkable hours earlier. The holographic star map Thel'zar had displayed showed the scope of galactic civilization - hundreds of species, thousands of worlds, trade networks spanning light-years.

General Petrov and Admiral Nimitz stood side by side, studying territorial boundaries of various alien empires.

> "These red zones," Petrov pointed to areas marked with warning symbols, "what are they?"

> "Aggressive expansionist civilizations," Thel'zar replied grimly. "Species that view other worlds as resources to be consumed or obstacles to be eliminated. Your planet lies near the outer edge of one such empire's sphere of influence."

The Americans and Soviets exchanged a meaningful look. Their earthly conflicts suddenly seemed petty in comparison.

British businessman Hugh Fairfax leaned back in his chair, overwhelmed. "Gentleman, we're discussing the fate of our entire species. Our trade disputes and territorial squabbles are meaningless in this context."

> "Exactly the realization we hoped you would reach," Thel'zar confirmed. "Successful spacefaring civilizations understand that internal cooperation is essential for survival in a larger, more dangerous galaxy."

Dr. Li Wei looked up from calculations he'd been scribbling. "Thel'zar, you mentioned that contact was becoming inevitable. Are we... are we in immediate danger?"

> "Not immediate, but your technological advancement has accelerated beyond our projections. Your nuclear weapons tests have created energy signatures detectable across several star systems. Some civilizations view such capabilities as either a threat to be eliminated or a resource to be claimed."

## 1947-07-26T19:45:08-06:00, Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas

As evening approached, the group had naturally organized itself into working committees. National boundaries seemed to dissolve as experts collaborated on common challenges. Soviet physicist Dr. Yevgeny Volkov worked alongside American engineer Robert Goddard on propulsion systems. British diplomat Sir Anthony Eden found common ground with his French counterpart, Auguste Champetier de Ribes, on organizational frameworks.

The transformation was remarkable to observe. Men who had been shooting at each other two years earlier were now planning humanity's future among the stars.

General Haytham watched this evolution with satisfaction. "Thel'zar, this cooperation you're seeing - is this typical for first contact situations?"

> "Each species responds differently. Some immediately unite against the perceived external threat. Others fragment further, with various factions attempting to secure exclusive advantages. Your species appears to be choosing unity, which is... encouraging."

Japanese diplomat Nakamura raised a concern that had been troubling several participants. "The scope of what you're proposing - a shadow organization operating across all our governments - this could be seen as conspiracy or treason by our respective leaders."

> "A valid concern," Thel'zar acknowledged. "Which is why this organization must be structured to serve each nation's interests while advancing the common goal of peaceful transition to interstellar civilization. Your leaders must see concrete benefits, not just abstract promises."

Italian engineer Marcelli looked thoughtful. "The technology transfers alone would revolutionize our economies. But carefully managed, gradually introduced..."

> "Precisely. Too much too fast leads to social collapse. Too little too slow leaves you vulnerable to less patient civilizations."

## 1947-07-27T21:30:45-06:00, Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas

Days later, they were still in talks, discussing organization, plans, next steps. The group was naturally segmenting into subgroups, as people of the same fields found each other and took to planning. Slowly, but surely, an organization tree was coming together, with an oversight committee positioned at the top to oversee operations.

But something remarkable had happened during those days of intense collaboration. The bitter nationalism that had defined global politics for decades had given way to a shared sense of human identity. Soviet General Petrov and American Admiral Nimitz had developed a mutual respect born from facing an incomprehensibly vast universe together. British and German scientists worked side by side, their wartime enmity forgotten in the face of technologies that dwarfed their earthly achievements.

> "One thing is clear, we cannot go public. Not yet, anyway, no society is ready for this kind of shock. The last this we need is another world war." - protested Japanese diplomat Takayama Nakamura.

> "I agree. This will be a long game for sure." - concurred British businessman Hugh Fairfax - "We probably won't live to see it come to fruition, and I suspect our grandchildren won't either. We need a name if we are to exist for that long. I propose ... *Order of the Silent Star*!"

Nakamura appeared to weigh the proposal then shook his head."No. It speaks of secret working, yes, but it doesn't speak of unity." - he thought briefly - "What about *Court of Earth*?"

> "If it's a name, it has to be something that expresses who we are and what we're doing: taking humanity from the Earth into space. This only references Earth, but not what's beyond." - countered John Alvers from MIT. - "I say ... *Consortium Ad Astra*! It's Latin, it means 'to the stars'."

> "A disparate group, working towards a common goal... From Earth... To space..." - Karl Schmitt of the Berlin University mused.

> "A Federation. From Earth to space. EarthSpace. *The EarthSpace Federation*!" - Henry Smith, the American diplomat's face lit up - "That's it!"

> "Bloody hell, I actually like that! It's settled then, here begins the EarthSpace Federation!" - Hugh slammed on the table, as all others nodded.

General Petrov raised his hand. "Comrades - forgive me, colleagues - we have spent days planning structure and goals. But what of our first act as this... EarthSpace Federation?"

Thel'zar, who had observed the naming discussion with apparent satisfaction, stepped forward.

> "Your first act should be to prove to your respective governments that this cooperation serves their national interests. I suggest we begin with a demonstration of the benefits this partnership can provide."

> "What kind of demonstration?" asked Admiral Nimitz.

> "Your American rockets are primitive but promising. Your Soviet engineering is robust but limited by materials science. Your British have excellent theoretical frameworks but lack manufacturing capability. Your French possess precision manufacturing but need better power systems." Thel'zar gestured to the assembled group. "Separately, each nation struggles with fundamental limitations. Together, with modest technological guidance, you could achieve spaceflight within five years instead of fifteen."

The implications hung in the air. Dr. Li Wei spoke first. "You're proposing we pool our resources and knowledge."

> "I am proposing you begin thinking as citizens of Earth rather than subjects of individual nations. The galaxy does not recognize your artificial borders."

A few days later, the oversight committee signed their declaration establishing the *EarthSpace Federation*, pledging their efforts to elevating humanity to its rightful place among the stars, working from the shadows and behind the scenes until mankind was ready to learn the truth.

And so it began.
