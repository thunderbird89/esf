## 1947-07-07T23:34:16-06:00, Roswell, New Mexico

Sergeant Nathaniel Summers stood on the rim of the crater with his torch scanning the scene before him. He hadn't the slightest clue about what he was seeing, other than knowing he was severely out of his depth. As a soldier, he was trained to confront the unexpected, but nothing in boot camp or his service manuals had prepared him for this. When he saw the shooting star half an hour earlier and made his wish to be someone notable, he never actually expected it to come true. Then came the shockwave and the thunder.

Nathaniel drove his jeep in the direction he saw the shooting star land as fast as it could go over the New Mexico desert. When he arrived at the crater, the fires were starting to die down. He carefully made his way to the rim of the crater and looked down at the metallic object within - a few fires were still burning over it here and there, but mostly it was just smoldering quietly.  
He did the only sensible thing he could come up with: grabbed the radio in his jeep, and called it in.

He nervously walked back to the crater, and shone his torch down at the bottom again. The object at the bottom was charred, a large chunk of it was missing, like something inside exploded outwards. It reminded Sgt. Summers of the manta rays he saw in his son's school books - it had a thicker cylindrical middle section that tapered out to both sides into what looked like wings. It must have been 10-15 meters long, and almost equally wide, though he could not guess how much of it was lost in its descent. Its surface was blackened from intense heat, but in some places, dull dark grey coloration was visible - he guessed it was the original surface color that survived the violent crash. As he scanned the wreck with his light, he muttered under his breath.

"What have I gotten myself into? And did I *really* have to make that wish...?"

General John Haytham was seated in the ready room of the small airfield that suddenly lit up on the leadership's radar. He spent the better part of the early morning flying and driving in, and he had to admit his body was not used to that any more. He sipped the coffee and muttered a thanks to the young NC lady. Across the table sat the base commander, an engineer, and two scientists in white lab coats.

> "So let me get this straight: you're saying you haven't the slightest clue as to what that hell that thing in your hangar is, only that it's not from around here. Is that what you're saying?" - he growled at Colonel Blanchard - "And you flew me out here to middle of nowhere to tell me that?"

> "General, let me rephrase that in another way: we definitely know it's not ours, and we're quite sure it's not a Soviet contraption either. Or if it is, we're in deep trouble. Either way, I think what Dr. Platchett here is trying to say is that it's ... not from Earth at all, and I tend to agree with him. We think it came from out there..." - he waved a hand towards the ceiling.

> "Hm. Private ... Stevens, you're an engineer. What do you think?"

> "Sir, I would agree with the doctor here. I've seen the reports of Soviet fighters we recovered, and this ... this is nothing like it. Like, I don't know Russian aside from vodka but I know machines. Or at least I thought I did, because I can't see anything even remotely familiar on this thing. Except..." - he trailed off, unsure if he should finish.

> "Except...? Out with it, private!"

> "Sir, there's a light that's been flashing ever since we brought it in. I can't make heads or tails of the writing, but it's flashing red and yellow, one flash a second, constantly. I saw something like this over at the Navy - I think it's a distress beacon, sir..."

The vessel hovered silently above the airfield, oblivious to the blaring klaxons underneath. The commander on the vessel's bridge observed the commotion on their viewscreens. It saw that the natives were frantically trying to communicate outwards, using radio frequencies, but the crew has already jammed all communications. They were sent to do one thing, recover a scout that suffered an accident and crashed, but now, observing the natives, the commander made a decision under his own authority.

> "Zreth'lar Kon'tak Prot'la Xinit'kha, Seren'vah."

The bridge crew looked at the commander quizzically. It nodded. One of the crew typed a few commands into their console, and glyphs began to stream in dense clusters.

A hatch opened on the underside of the vessel, and a small pod descended, landing in the middle of the airfield. The MPs surrounded it with their guns trained - they had no idea what was happening, but they knew their duty and their training, and they were ready to apply it if needed.A high-pitched whine started to rise from the pod, until everyone felt their ears ring, their guns vibrate in their hands, and their teeth itch in their mouth, before it suddenly stopped. Into the silence, a female voice spoke with a Southern accent.

> "Please. Don't shoot. I come in peace. I want to speak to General John Haytham, Private Michael Stevens, and Dr. Robert Platchett. I mean no harm."

The MPs looked at each other cautiously, then at their commanding officer. The officer motioned to one of his soldiers.

> "Get the egghead first. And prepare the General for evac if needed. Go."

The base's ready room was packed. Generals, engineers, scientists, diplomats, businessmen, representing all major powers on the globe. People were marched out of university lectures or board meetings, or were made offers they could not refuse to get them to come along. Eventually, all flights led to Texas, and everyone was waiting for what was about to happen, eyeing each other cautiously - after all, no matter how enticing the offer, a Russian general will have a hard time not reaching for his service weapon when in the same room as his American counterpart, even if said weapon is safe in a locker.

At 14:00:00 exactly, the door to the ready room opened, and in walked the strangest being they ever saw.The thing was short, at most 160 cm, built of long limbs and a slender torso, but possessing a wiry build that looked like an athlete. Its body was mostly covered by a tight, silvery suit, but its skin was a light bluish color, and its large eyes glimmered like that of an insect. Over its face, it wore a mask-like devices that pulsed slowly with a blue light around a filter. It stopped a few steps from the crowd, and craned its head around, looking at each face, taking a breath. When it spoke, it spoke with an unplaceable accent in its slightly mechanic-sounding voice.

A palpable tension filled the room. Some leaned forward in intrigue, while others recoiled slightly, their faces a mix of fear and fascination. If the alien noticed, it paid no heed to the reactions.

> "Thank you for coming. My name is Thel'zar Seren-Luna'ki. You, in this room, have been selected as our first contact community. You will be our extensions on this planet, our eyes and our hands. You will help elevate your civilization to walk among the stars with others. That is your task from now. I will assist you in this."

Days later, they were still in talks, discussing organization, plans, next steps. The group was naturally segmenting into subgroups, as people of the same fields found each other and took to planning. Slowly, but surely, an organization tree was coming together, with an oversight committee positioned at the top to oversee operations.

> "One thing is clear, we cannot go public. Not yet, anyway, no society is ready for this kind of shock. The last this we need is another world war." - protested Japanese diplomat Takayama Nakamura.

> "I agree. This will be a long game for sure." - concurred British businessman Hugh Fairfax - "We probably won't live to see it come to fruition, and I suspect our grandchildren won't either. We need a name if we are to exist for that long. I propose ... *Order of the Silent Star*!"

Nakamura appeared to weigh the proposal then shook his head."No. It speaks of secret working, yes, but it doesn't speak of unity." - he thought briefly - "What about *Court of Earth*?"

> "If it's a name, it has to be something that expresses who we are and what we're doing: taking humanity from the Earth into space. This only references Earth, but not what's beyond." - countered John Alvers from MIT. - "I say ... *Consortium Ad Astra*! It's Latin, it means 'to the stars'."

> "A disparate group, working towards a common goal... From Earth... To space..." - Karl Schmitt of the Berlin University mused.

> "A Federation. From Earth to space. EarthSpace. *The EarthSpace Federation*!" - Henry Smith, the American diplomat's face lit up - "That's it!"

> "Bloody hell, I actually like that! It's settled then, here begins the EarthSpace Federation!" - Hugh slammed on the table, as all others nodded.

A few days later, the oversight committee signed their declaration establishing the *EarthSpace Federation*, pledging their efforts to elevating humanity to its rightful place among the stars, working from the shadows and behind the scenes until mankind was ready to learn the truth.

And so it began.
