### NATO Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium  
**0930 Hours CET**

The sprawling assembly hall hummed with tension as NATO delegates filled their seats. The round table gleamed under the harsh conference lights, casting a spotlight on the animated debate that had engulfed the room.

At the center of the storm stood Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General, his calm demeanor betraying the mounting pressure. A towering screen behind him displayed the words: *"Proposal to Formalize NATO-Federation Cooperation Agreement"*—a title far more benign than the reality of its implications.

Most representatives leaned toward support. The Federation’s unparalleled technological prowess had already transformed conflicts in favor of NATO’s member states in recent years, particularly in joint operations involving the United States, Israel, and Japan. However, two dissenting voices dominated the morning's discussion.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán leaned forward, his elbows resting heavily on the polished table. His face, already flushed, darkened as he spoke with characteristic defiance. "This proposal undermines the sovereignty of our alliance. A shadow organization—one we barely understand—being allowed access to our strategic frameworks? It’s absurd! Hungary cannot endorse this madness."

Across the table, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan smirked, his tone sharp and calculated. "Indeed. Such a partnership brings with it questions of loyalty. Where are the assurances for our economies? For Turkey's critical industries? If the Federation desires cooperation, let them earn it—not ride in as some benevolent benefactor above reproach." His gaze scanned the room, daring anyone to challenge his words.

The hall buzzed with murmurs as the other representatives exchanged wary glances. Stoltenberg held up a hand, calling for order. "Your concerns are noted, gentlemen. However, let us not forget the unprecedented advantages this cooperation offers—advantages that have already been demonstrated in the field."

Orban scoffed loudly, muttering to the Hungarian defense minister beside him, "Advantages for the Americans and their puppets, you mean."

Stoltenberg’s jaw tightened, but he chose not to acknowledge the barb. "The Federation has not sought membership. They respect our alliance’s autonomy and only wish to engage as partners. This is not a merger or a surrender of our sovereignty."

"But how can we trust their motives?" Orban pressed. "Who funds them? Who directs their actions? We would be blind to hand them access to our strategies."

Stoltenberg's retort was cut short by the timed buzzer signaling the morning recess. He rapped his gavel. "We will reconvene in thirty minutes to continue deliberations. Use this time wisely." 

### Recess in the Private Chambers

The smaller, private chambers off the main hall were a haven for quieter, more pointed discussions. Stoltenberg poured himself a cup of coffee and turned to greet the U.S. Secretary of Defense, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Anthony Harper. All wore varying expressions of concern and determination.

Scholz adjusted his glasses, his voice low but firm. "Orban and Erdogan are determined to stall this. They see an opportunity to make demands, or worse, destabilize the alliance itself."

"Fortunately," Stoltenberg replied, "they can’t block it outright. This is not a matter requiring unanimous approval. The Federation is not seeking membership. A simple supermajority will suffice for ratification."

Anthony Harper leaned back against the wall, his arms crossed. "That still means we need to rally those on the fence. Spain and Italy, perhaps. Poland is already on board, as are most of the Baltics. But France..." He trailed off meaningfully, his expression pensive.

"France is concerned about autonomy," Scholz said. "They’ll need reassurances that the Federation won’t overstep. If we can deliver that, Macron will back us. Erdogan, though? He’s simply posturing for economic concessions."

"And Orban?" Harper asked.

"Orban isn’t playing for Hungary," Stoltenberg said grimly. "He’s playing for Moscow. He knows aligning with the Federation could tip the scales against Russian influence in Europe."

There was a murmur of agreement. Stoltenberg took a sip of his coffee and placed the cup down with deliberate care. "We need to focus on the undecided. Erdogan will attempt to stir the pot, but once he realizes his position is untenable, he’ll extract his pound of flesh and fall in line. Orban... we just have to outvote him."

"And the Federation itself?" Scholz asked. "They’re unnervingly quiet. It’s as if they expect us to do the hard work while they wait."

"They don’t want to be part of NATO," Stoltenberg reminded him. "That much is clear. They’ve made no demands for oversight or access to classified files. They’ve only offered their assistance. We don’t need to sell their case. They’ve already proven themselves in the field."

"But," Harper interjected, "this silence only fuels suspicion. If we’re going to pull this off, we’ll need to control the narrative." He glanced at the clock. "Let’s get back. I’m sure Erdogan’s already warming up his next speech."

### Return to the Assembly Hall

As the delegates returned to their seats, the tension in the air was palpable. Stoltenberg stepped to the podium once more, his hands gripping the edges as he surveyed the room.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he began, his voice steady. "We are at a crossroads. This partnership with the EarthSpace Federation is not just a matter of military strategy; it is an opportunity to secure the future of this alliance. We face threats—known and unknown—that demand we adapt, evolve, and, yes, cooperate with those who can strengthen us."

His gaze swept over the room, locking briefly on Orban and Erdogan, who remained resolutely impassive. "Let us use this time to debate, deliberate, and decide—not from a place of fear or self-interest, but from a place of unity. The world is watching."

In the shadows of the assembly hall, unseen and unnoticed, a Federation observer watched the proceedings intently. Dressed inconspicuously, they blended into the crowd, their presence a silent reminder that this alliance, if forged, would mark a turning point in history.

### The Debate Unfolds  

The Mediterranean delegates were among the first to break the ice after Stoltenberg’s opening remarks. Spain’s representative, Defense Minister Luis Rivera, cleared his throat and leaned into his microphone.  

"Secretary General, Spain recognizes the advantages of this partnership. The Federation’s technological contributions have already proven critical in stabilizing operations against asymmetric threats. We have seen the results in allied operations. Our stance is clear: we support this agreement."  

The Italian representative, Foreign Minister Alessandra Mancini, quickly followed. "Italy concurs. We cannot ignore the strategic benefits this partnership would bring, especially in the Mediterranean theater, where NATO’s naval forces could use advanced resources. This cooperation strengthens us all."  

There was a faint ripple of applause from the southern bloc. Erdogan scowled, but Rivera’s and Mancini’s statements had set the tone.  

From the Nordic group, Finland’s Defense Minister Erik Lund stood, his calm voice laced with urgency. "The Baltic and Nordic regions face mounting pressures from our eastern neighbor." His subtle emphasis on *eastern neighbor* drew knowing nods from the room. "If the Federation can augment our intelligence-sharing capabilities or provide additional resources for border defense, we would welcome their involvement. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland stand united in support."  

Estonia’s delegate rose next, her voice firm. "Poland and the Baltics echo these sentiments. We cannot afford to wait for the next crisis to understand the Federation’s potential. Let us not forget how NATO emerged—through cooperation and foresight. We support this."  

Erdogan leaned into his microphone, his voice heavy with derision. "How convenient for those of you on Russia’s doorstep. The Federation’s technology may guard your borders, but Turkey bears the weight of refugee crises, instability, and economic fallout from conflicts you benefit from at arm’s length. Where is our guarantee of investment, of parity in this so-called partnership?"  

The room stirred uneasily at the sharpness of his words. Orban smirked, clearly reveling in Erdogan’s maneuvering.  

"President Erdogan," Stoltenberg replied evenly, "Turkey’s position as a critical NATO ally is undisputed. This partnership would not diminish that, nor would it favor one region over another. The Federation has made no demands for territorial alignments or strategic assets—they are offering resources, not seeking them."  

Erdogan raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. "And what of the autonomy you so proudly claim NATO will retain? Partnerships can have strings, Secretary General. Perhaps not visible now, but later, when leverage is exercised—"  

"Leverage is precisely why Poland and the Baltics support this," interrupted Poland’s representative, Marek Kowalski. "Forgive my bluntness, but Russia does not wait for hesitation. We cannot afford to look at potential allies with suspicion when our borders face real, immediate threats. Turkey has its challenges, but we face ours as well. This partnership does not weaken NATO; it bolsters it."  

### France Joins the Fray  

All eyes turned to the French delegation. President Emmanuel Macron, seated among his advisors, had remained silent thus far, carefully gauging the room’s mood. Now, he leaned forward, resting his chin on clasped hands before speaking with deliberate precision.  

"France has concerns, as you well know," he began, his voice steady but authoritative. "NATO must always ensure its autonomy. This is a principle France will not compromise. However—" He paused for emphasis, the room holding its collective breath.  

"The Federation has demonstrated respect for this autonomy by not seeking membership. They offer tools, resources, and expertise without attempting to dictate our actions. This is what sets them apart from other powers who claim to support NATO while eroding its cohesion."  

His gaze swept the room, lingering on Orban and Erdogan. "France supports this partnership—on the condition that NATO retains full operational independence. Secretary General, you will have our vote if these safeguards are codified into the agreement."  

The chamber erupted into a wave of murmured discussions. Macron’s support carried significant weight, particularly for those still wavering.  

### Closing the Debate  

With the Mediterranean bloc aligned, the Nordics and Baltics unified, and now France on board, Stoltenberg felt the tide shifting. He took the opportunity to press forward.  

"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have heard enough to move forward. This partnership is not about replacing NATO’s capabilities or compromising our sovereignty. It is about facing threats that challenge us all—collectively. The Federation has made no demands beyond the opportunity to cooperate."  

He glanced meaningfully at Erdogan and Orban. "The majority has spoken, and while unanimity would be preferable, it is not required. Those who wish to vote against this are free to do so, but I urge you to consider the message we send to both our allies and our adversaries."  

Erdogan leaned back, his expression stony, but there was a glint in his eye that suggested he was already calculating what concessions he could extract. Orban crossed his arms and stared at the table, his lips pressed into a thin line.  

"We will vote at the conclusion of today’s session," Stoltenberg announced. "Until then, I encourage any remaining questions or discussions to be resolved. The stakes are too high for indecision."  

As the delegates dispersed for lunch, the room buzzed with animated conversations. In the corner, Stoltenberg exchanged a glance with Scholz and Harper. The battle wasn’t over, but the victory was within reach.  

Unbeknownst to them, a Federation operative, observing from a shadowed gallery above, slipped quietly away, their work for the day already underway.

### The Votes Are Cast  

The next morning, the air in the NATO assembly hall was heavy with anticipation. Delegates filed into their seats, the previous day’s debates still etched on their faces—determination, lingering doubt, and in some cases, resentment. The proposal to formalize the NATO-Federation Cooperation Agreement loomed large on the agenda, and the final vote would decide its fate.

Jens Stoltenberg stood at the central podium, his demeanor composed but with a quiet energy beneath the surface. "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now proceed to the vote. As a reminder, this is not a unanimous decision—only a supermajority is required to pass. Please submit your votes via your console."

The hall fell silent except for the soft tapping of fingers on touchscreens. Large monitors positioned around the room displayed a real-time tally, each nation’s vote lighting up in green or red as it was cast.

One by one, green indicators dominated the screen.

Spain. Italy. Greece. France. Finland. Sweden. Poland. Estonia. Germany. The Baltics and the Nordics all stood firm, their solidarity unmistakable.  

A scattering of red votes appeared: Hungary, Turkey, and a few smaller nations hesitant about the Federation’s ambiguous motives. Still, the tide was overwhelmingly clear.  

As the final votes tallied, the screen displayed the result in bold lettering:  
**"Measure Passed: 83% Approval."**

A soft murmur filled the room, quickly rising to a wave of applause. Stoltenberg allowed himself a small smile, stepping forward to address the chamber.

"The NATO-Federation Cooperation Agreement is now ratified. This marks a significant milestone for our alliance and our collective security. I want to thank each of you for your commitment to ensuring NATO remains adaptable to new challenges while safeguarding our principles."  

The applause intensified, though not everyone joined. Orban sat stiffly in his chair, lips pursed, while Erdogan exchanged a glance with his foreign minister, already muttering about what Turkey could negotiate in the aftermath.  

Stoltenberg raised his hands for calm. "With this vote concluded, our next steps will be to finalize the operational details with our new partners. As I stated yesterday, NATO’s independence remains paramount, and this cooperation will enhance our capabilities without compromising our sovereignty."

But before he could continue, the massive monitors around the room flickered suddenly, interrupting his remarks. 

### The Emblem Appears  

The NATO emblem dissolved into static, replaced by a new image: a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, two broken swords crossed in the background—a simple yet striking symbol. Beneath it, in bold, serifed text, the words appeared:  
**"We Are Watching."**

Gasps echoed through the room. Delegates glanced at one another, puzzled, some clearly unnerved. Stoltenberg turned sharply toward his staff seated near the technical control booth. "What is this? Shut it down!" he hissed into his microphone.

The technical team scrambled, but their frantic gestures made it clear they had no control over the display. The emblem remained, unwavering, as if silently watching back.

France’s Macron leaned toward his foreign minister. "Did they plan this? We agreed this was a NATO-led announcement."  

"I don’t think this is us," the minister whispered, her eyes fixed on the screen.  

Erdogan, his face darkened with suspicion, muttered, "So this is how they introduce themselves? By hijacking our systems? Are these the partners we just approved?"  

The Hungarian delegate, seated next to Orban, whispered nervously, "Is this a warning?"  

Orban did not respond. His eyes were locked on the display, but his lips curved ever so slightly in a sly, knowing grin.  

Meanwhile, Stoltenberg stepped forward again, speaking firmly into his microphone, though his voice carried a tinge of unease. "Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. We will resolve this technical issue immediately. There is no cause for alarm."

But the emblem lingered for a few more moments, its silent message resonating in the room. Then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it vanished. The screens returned to their previous display of NATO’s emblem, and the technical staff regained control.

### A Confused Silence  

For a moment, the room was eerily quiet. Stoltenberg glanced at his closest advisors, then back at the assembly. "It seems we have more to discuss with our new partners," he said dryly, earning a few nervous chuckles.  

The delegates exchanged wary glances. Some whispered among themselves, others sat in contemplative silence. Erdogan looked visibly displeased, while Macron and Scholz appeared deep in thought. Orban, for his part, said nothing, but his demeanor hinted at a quiet satisfaction, as if the display had only confirmed his suspicions.  

As the session adjourned, the hall buzzed with speculation. What had just happened? Was this the Federation’s idea of an introduction, or something else entirely? And most troubling of all—if they could seize NATO’s systems so effortlessly, what else could they do?

The NATO delegates left the assembly, their minds awhirl with questions. Whatever their thoughts on the vote, one thing was certain: the Federation had made their presence known. And in their own, unsettling way, they had left an indelible mark on NATO’s most historic day.

### The Arrival

#### NATO Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium  
**0900 Hours CET, Three Weeks Later**

The press room of NATO Headquarters was packed to capacity, the air electric with anticipation. Delegates, aides, journalists, and military representatives milled about, exchanging hushed conversations as the time for the ceremony drew closer. Cameras lined the back wall, their operators poised for the historic moment about to unfold.

At the center of the room stood a long table draped in dark blue, adorned with the flags of NATO’s 31 member states. A single additional flagpole remained bare, a subtle nod to the Federation’s deliberate non-membership. Behind the table, a digital display alternated between the NATO emblem and the Federation’s wireframe globe encircled by laurels—the broken swords glinting faintly.

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stood with a handful of key NATO officials near the table, their expressions calm but tinged with curiosity. This was the first time most of them would meet the Federation’s representatives face-to-face. 

"Any updates from security?" Stoltenberg asked an aide.

"Nothing unusual," the aide replied. "Their transport cleared our airspace undetected until the final approach. They’ll arrive any moment now."

Stoltenberg nodded, adjusting his tie as he exchanged a look with the French and American delegations. "Let’s keep this smooth. No surprises this time."

#### The Federation's Arrival  

The low hum of conversation abruptly ceased as the double doors at the far end of the room opened. All eyes turned to the newcomers.

Commander Eli Wallace, the Federation’s lead delegate, strode into the room with an effortless calm. He was flanked by two officers in crisp, minimalist uniforms that bore no rank insignia, only the Federation’s emblem over their left breast. Wallace himself wore a similar uniform, his tall frame and sharp features projecting quiet confidence. A faint sheen on his silver-trimmed cuffs hinted at the advanced materials woven into the fabric—practical yet unassuming.

Behind them, a group of aides followed, carrying sleek, black cases. Their movements were disciplined, their expressions unreadable. They exuded an air of quiet professionalism that only added to the mystique surrounding the Federation.

Wallace stopped a few paces from Stoltenberg and extended a hand. "Secretary General Stoltenberg," he said with a warm smile. "Commander Eli Wallace, EarthSpace Federation. Thank you for welcoming us."

Stoltenberg clasped the offered hand firmly. "Commander Wallace, it’s an honor to finally meet you in person. On behalf of NATO, welcome to Brussels."

Wallace’s gaze swept the room, taking in the mix of curiosity, skepticism, and guarded respect among the assembled dignitaries. "It’s a pleasure to be here. Let’s make history, shall we?"

#### The Signing Ceremony  

The ceremony began promptly, with Stoltenberg addressing the room. His speech highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership, the Federation’s proven contributions, and the shared commitment to global stability. He was careful to emphasize NATO’s autonomy, a reassurance tailored for those still wary of the Federation’s motives.

When Stoltenberg finished, Wallace stepped to the microphone. His voice was measured, his tone sincere. "We stand here today not as outsiders, but as partners. The Federation exists to ensure humanity’s safety and stability, and it is clear that NATO has been the cornerstone of those values for decades. This agreement is not about control or dominance—it’s about trust, collaboration, and the future."

As Wallace spoke, Stoltenberg caught Macron’s nod of approval out of the corner of his eye. Even Erdogan, seated with folded arms, appeared less openly skeptical than during the debates weeks prior.

When the speeches concluded, the moment everyone had been waiting for arrived. Stoltenberg and Wallace approached the table, flanked by their respective aides. A NATO official placed the agreement on the table, its leather-bound cover embossed with both organizations’ emblems.

Wallace produced a sleek pen from his breast pocket, its design unmistakably Federation—a fusion of form and function, metallic yet organic in appearance. As he signed his name with a steady hand, flashes from the cameras lit up the room.

Stoltenberg followed, his signature steady and deliberate. As his pen left the page, the room erupted into applause, though a few delegates clapped more reservedly than others.  

#### A Subtle Display  

As the applause faded, the digital screens behind the table flickered to life. Once again, the Federation’s emblem appeared next to NATO’s, but this time, it was a deliberate gesture. The display had been coordinated in advance, a symbolic representation of their partnership. The two emblems revolved slowly, their shared presence projecting unity.

Wallace turned to Stoltenberg, a faint smile playing on his lips. "A small addition to mark the occasion," he said lightly, gesturing to the screens.

Stoltenberg nodded, though he detected murmurs among the delegates. The symbol was visually striking, but its implications lingered in the room like an unspoken question. Was this partnership truly equal, or had NATO just invited a quiet overseer into its ranks?

As the delegates rose for a formal photo, the unease was palpable among some. Macron exchanged a glance with Scholz, who shrugged almost imperceptibly. Erdogan muttered something to his aide, his gaze fixed on the screens.

#### Aftermath  

As the delegates filed out for the post-ceremony reception, Stoltenberg found himself alone with Wallace for a brief moment. 

"You made quite an impression," Stoltenberg said carefully.  

Wallace’s expression was inscrutable. "That was the idea. We’re here to help, Secretary General. But we also need NATO’s trust. And sometimes, trust begins with understanding who’s watching over the bigger picture."

"‘We Are Watching,’" Stoltenberg said, echoing the Federation’s enigmatic slogan.

Wallace nodded, the faintest glimmer of amusement in his eyes. "It’s not a threat, Secretary General. It’s a promise."

And with that, Wallace stepped away to join his team, leaving Stoltenberg with the uneasy sense that the Federation’s presence in NATO would be far from simple.

##  

#### NATO Proving Grounds, Classified Location  
**0930 Hours Local Time**

The crisp morning air buzzed with the electric hum of advanced weaponry. Rows of targets stretched out across the proving grounds, each designed to withstand—or be obliterated by—intense firepower. NATO soldiers stood in a loose formation at the range, their familiar assault rifles replaced with sleek, angular weapons that gleamed under the sun. These were magnetic and plasma rifles, fresh out of Federation armories, and they were a far cry from the tools the soldiers had trained with before.

Standing nearby, a group of Federation officers and engineers observed, their sharp, minimalist uniforms in stark contrast to the rugged NATO fatigues. Commander Eli Wallace watched the proceedings with crossed arms, flanked by Lieutenant Anna Grayson, a seasoned weapons specialist, and several engineers who were adjusting equipment and taking notes.

"Alright, let’s start with the basics," Grayson called out, her voice carrying over the low murmurs of the soldiers. She gestured to the rifle in her hands—a sleek, dark gray magnetic accelerator rifle with glowing blue strips along the barrel. "This is the **MRG-7 Assault Railgun**. Fires 2mm tungsten darts at hypersonic velocities. No gunpowder, no recoil, and no jamming."

The NATO soldiers exchanged skeptical looks, and one, a burly American sergeant named Callahan, raised his hand. "No recoil? C’mon, every rifle kicks. That’s physics."

Grayson smirked. "You’ll see, Sergeant. The magnetic rails handle the propulsion, and the counterforce is dispersed through the chassis. No need to fight the gun—it’s designed to work with you, not against you."

Callahan grunted, unconvinced, as Grayson handed him the weapon. "Here. You’re up first. Standard posture. Aim for the medium-range targets."

Callahan stepped up to the firing line, adjusting his stance. The rifle felt unnervingly light in his hands, its grip cool and comfortable. He peered through the digital scope, which automatically highlighted the targets with subtle red outlines. With a hesitant exhale, he squeezed the trigger.

A sharp *crack* split the air as the rifle discharged, sending a dart downrange at blistering speed. The impact obliterated the target in an instant, a small cloud of synthetic debris kicking up in its wake. Callahan blinked, lowering the rifle.  

"That’s… that’s it?" he asked, his tone a mix of awe and disbelief.  

Grayson raised an eyebrow. "That’s it. No kick, no flash, no overcompensation. Just precision. Try the next target."

Callahan fired again, this time with more confidence. Each shot landed squarely in the center of the target, the rifle’s advanced targeting system compensating for wind and minor hand movements. By the fourth shot, he was grinning like a kid at Christmas.

"Okay," he admitted, stepping back, "this is something else."

"Glad you approve," Grayson said with a small laugh. "Next up, the plasma rifle."

#### The Plasma Rifle Demonstration  

As Callahan stepped back, Grayson held up a bulkier weapon with faintly glowing vents along its barrel. "This," she said, "is the **PL-25 Plasma Rifle**. It’s low-power by our standards—only about 30 megawatts—but it’s more than enough to ruin anyone’s day. Standard loadout includes thermal clips to handle the heat buildup. After five shots, you’ll either need to wait for it to cool or eject the clip and replace it."

A British corporal stepped forward next, her stance professional but her expression skeptical. "Looks heavy," she remarked.

"Surprisingly not," Grayson replied, handing her the rifle. "The power cells are compact, and the design’s balanced to keep the weight distributed."

The corporal raised the weapon and aimed downrange. Grayson nodded toward the reinforced targets at the far end. "Those are rated to withstand a tank shell. Fire at will."

The corporal squeezed the trigger, and a bolt of superheated plasma streaked through the air, striking the target with a deafening hiss. The heat from the impact left a glowing crater in the reinforced plate, molten metal dripping to the ground.

"Bloody hell," the corporal muttered, lowering the rifle and staring at the damage. She glanced back at Grayson. "You said this was low-power?"

Grayson chuckled. "You should see what our higher-powered models do. But this is more than enough for field operations. Lightweight, reliable, and packs a punch."

Callahan stepped forward, his eyes on the plasma rifle. "What happens if the thermal clip overheats and you don’t replace it in time?"

Grayson gestured to the vents on the weapon. "It’ll lock you out of firing and vent the excess heat automatically. Worst case, you’re stuck in cooldown mode for a few minutes. But as long as you manage your shots, you won’t have that problem."

Another soldier raised a hand, his German accent thick. "And what of the shields? These weapons can penetrate them?"

Wallace, who had been observing in silence, finally stepped forward. "Federation rifles are designed with shields in mind," he explained. "Magnetic accelerators like the MRG-7 fire at velocities high enough to overwhelm most energy barriers, while plasma weapons generate so much heat that even shielded targets can’t sustain prolonged exposure. Of course," he added with a wry smile, "our shields are better."

This drew a few chuckles from the NATO troops. Grayson took the opportunity to hand the next soldier in line a rifle. "Alright, who’s next? Let’s see how you handle it."  

#### Observations from the Federation  

As the soldiers cycled through the weapons, testing their capabilities with growing enthusiasm, the Federation engineers conferred quietly behind them, taking notes on the soldiers’ performance and reactions.  

"They’re adapting faster than expected," one engineer murmured to Wallace.  

"They’re professionals," Wallace replied, watching as Callahan barked encouragement at his squadmates. "They’ll get the hang of it soon enough. The real question is whether they’ll trust it in the field."  

Grayson approached, nodding toward the soldiers. "They’re warming up to the hardware. A few more days of this, and they’ll be running drills like they’ve been using this tech for years."

"Let’s hope so," Wallace said, his tone thoughtful. "This is just the beginning. If they can integrate these tools into their doctrine, we’ll see results. If not..." He trailed off, leaving the implications unspoken.  

Grayson glanced back at the firing line, where another plasma bolt scorched through a target. "They’ll get there," she said confidently. "You just have to trust them."  

Wallace nodded, though his gaze remained on the NATO troops. Trust, he knew, was a two-way street—and the Federation still had much to prove.

### Landmates: Steel and Muscle  

#### NATO Proving Grounds – Mech Training Area  
**1030 Hours Local Time**  

A short distance from the firing range, a new demonstration was underway. The proving grounds had been modified to accommodate the Federation’s latest contribution to NATO’s warfighting capabilities: *Landmates*. These towering, humanoid combat suits stood in a row, their cockpits open and inviting. Their angular exteriors gleamed in the morning sun, heavy plating and reinforced joints giving them the look of mechanical warriors at rest.

A group of NATO infantrymen—most of them skeptical, all of them curious—stood in front of the massive machines, their eyes darting between the Federation instructor and the towering exosuits. The instructor, a grizzled, broad-shouldered Federation officer named Lieutenant Marcus Voss, had the air of a seasoned veteran who had seen it all. 

With a sharp clap of his hands, he caught their attention. "Alright, listen up! This—" he gestured to the nearest Landmate, "—is the Landmate, the Federation’s answer to the problem of urban operations versus mechanized infantry. Once you step into the cockpit, it’s like wearing your own personal MBT."  

The NATO soldiers exchanged glances, the prospect equal parts thrilling and intimidating.  

A Spanish soldier, Corporal Javier Torres, raised a hand. "What’s the learning curve on one of these?"  

"Surprisingly short and flat, son," Voss replied with a chuckle. "Once your arms and legs are in the receptacles, it basically copies your movements, scaled up—you move, it moves; you punch, it punches. You jump—" He jabbed a thumb toward the Landmate’s back-mounted thrusters. "—you’re basically jumping with four tons of hardware on you, so the jump jets fire automatically and guide you to a landing."  

The soldiers murmured amongst themselves, a mixture of excitement and apprehension.  

A German grenadier, Sergeant Klaus Richter, crossed his arms. "No offense, Lieutenant, but I’ve seen powered armor programs before. All of them take months—sometimes *years*—to train operators properly."  

Voss smirked. "Well, Sergeant, those weren’t *our* systems. Federation engineering is about *intuitive control*. You’re not piloting a vehicle—you’re moving your own body, just… with a *lot* more metal wrapped around it." He pointed at the nearest Landmate’s open cockpit. "Now, you—step up here, and get in!"  

#### First Steps  

Torres hesitated only a second before jogging forward. The Landmate’s torso was wide open, revealing the harnessed cockpit within. A small ladder allowed him to climb up, and with a final glance at Voss, he swung himself into the seat. The cockpit enclosed him with a smooth *hiss* as the restraints locked in.  

"Alright," Voss called. "First thing’s first: the *interface*. Your arms and legs go into those receptacles—yeah, just like that." He watched as Torres slid his limbs into the padded sleeves. "Good. Now, relax. Don’t overthink it. Just *move*."  

Torres swallowed, then lifted his right arm experimentally. The Landmate mirrored the action instantly, its massive metal limb moving in perfect synchronization. His left arm followed, then both legs, the servos humming softly with each motion.  

"Good," Voss encouraged. "Now, basic movements—walk, run, punch, kick. Take your time."  

Torres took a cautious step forward, then another. The Landmate moved with him, eerily smooth, its massive feet thudding onto the reinforced pavement. A grin spread across his face as he picked up the pace, breaking into a jog. The suit responded effortlessly, its servos and balancing algorithms keeping him steady.  

"*Madre de Dios*," Torres breathed, his grin widening.  

"Alright, let’s see how you hit," Voss called. "Find that practice dummy on your left and give it a jab."  

Torres turned, spotting a reinforced combat dummy set up for melee training. He drew back a fist and threw a punch. The Landmate’s arm shot forward, the strike landing with a *thunderous* impact that sent a deep reverberation through the dummy’s frame.  

The NATO troops murmured in amazement.  

"Not bad!" Voss called, nodding approvingly. "Now try a kick."  

Torres took a step back, then swung his leg forward. The Landmate’s massive foot *hammered* into the target, sending it flying a full ten meters before it crashed into the dirt.  

Laughter and cheers erupted from the watching NATO soldiers.  

"Now *that*," Torres said breathlessly, "was satisfying."  

Voss chuckled. "Told you—this thing *is* you, just bigger, stronger, and meaner. Imagine clearing a street with one of these. Or punching through a concrete wall instead of going through the door."  

Sergeant Richter stepped forward, watching Torres move inside the Landmate with increasing ease. "Alright, I’m convinced. I want in."  

Voss nodded and gestured to another Landmate. "Go for it. And the rest of you? Step up. The best way to learn is to *get in and move*."  

As more NATO soldiers climbed into the cockpits, the proving grounds filled with the sounds of heavy footfalls and testing strikes, the thudding impacts echoing across the training field.  

Watching from the sidelines, Commander Eli Wallace and Lieutenant Anna Grayson observed the exercise unfold.  

"They’re adapting quicker than I expected," Grayson remarked, arms crossed.  

Wallace nodded, watching as another Landmate leapt into the air, its jump jets guiding it to a smooth landing. "Give it a few more days, and they’ll be *dangerous* in those things."  

Grayson smirked. "Good. Let’s see what they can really do."

### Heavy Firepower: The Landmate’s Arsenal  

#### NATO Proving Grounds – Mech Training Area  
**1100 Hours Local Time**  

The ground trembled slightly as more NATO soldiers took their first steps inside the Landmates, the mechanical suits moving in perfect sync with their pilots. Laughter and shouts of excitement echoed through the training yard as they tested the suits' responsiveness—some cautiously walking, others sprinting, jumping, or practicing strikes against reinforced targets. 

Lieutenant Marcus Voss let them play for a moment before stepping forward and clapping his hands twice. "Alright, listen up! You’ve got the basics down. Now let’s talk about the **real** reason these beasts are worth their weight in gold—**weapons**."  

The chatter died down as the soldiers gathered around him, their Landmates towering above, standing at attention.  

Voss pointed to the **gimbaled autocannon** stowed flat against the back of one of the Landmates. "That thing is going to be your best friend, once you get over the initial shock. It fires at over **15,000 RPM** and can chew through an Abrams in **three seconds**—trust me, we tested it."  

A few of the NATO soldiers let out a low whistle of appreciation.  

"Wait, wait—hold up," Sergeant Klaus Richter called out, his helmet’s speakers amplifying his voice through his Landmate’s external audio. "You’re saying this thing can *outgun a main battle tank*?"  

Voss grinned. "That’s exactly what I’m saying, Sergeant. The Landmate isn’t just infantry support—it *is* mechanized infantry. It moves like a foot soldier but hits like a war machine. That **autocannon** isn’t just for show." He turned back to the others. "Now, normally, you won’t be firing that thing manually."  

A few heads turned at that.  

Voss continued, "The autocannon is usually controlled by the onboard AI, and it engages any **targets of opportunity** outside your firing arc. You worry about what’s in front of you, the AI will make sure nothing can sneak up on you from behind."  

The Spanish corporal, Javier Torres, who was still grinning from his earlier test run, raised an armored hand. "How fast is the AI? I mean, I don’t want it hesitating if I’ve got someone flanking me."  

Voss smirked. "You won’t have to worry about that, Corporal. The AI processes battlefield data in **real time**, reacting in *milliseconds*. If something pops up behind you, it’ll be ventilated before you even turn your head."  

Callahan, the burly American sergeant, ran a gloved hand over the autocannon’s casing. "Hell of a failsafe."  

Voss nodded. "It gets better. The autocannon is **smart**—it won’t waste ammo. If the target’s lightly armored, it’ll throttle back the fire rate to conserve rounds. If it’s a hardened target, it’ll go full *buzzsaw* and turn it into Swiss cheese."  

Richter let out a low chuckle. "I think I’m in love."  

Voss laughed. "Oh, you haven’t even seen the best part. You’ve got **two shoulder hardpoints** for missiles or extra guns, and the Landmate carries **a standard-issue rail rifle**—think of it as a scaled-up assault rifle, firing hypervelocity slugs that punch through anything short of a bunker wall."  

The NATO soldiers murmured in appreciation.  

"Alright," Voss continued, "let’s run a **live-fire drill**. Targets will pop up at random distances, some armored, some soft. Your job is to engage **what’s in front of you**, while the AI handles any flanking threats. No second-guessing it. Trust the system."  

The soldiers snapped to attention.  

"You heard the man," Torres called out, gripping his Landmate’s rifle. "Let’s see what these things can do!"  

Voss grinned. "That’s the spirit. **Lock and load!**"  

The proving grounds roared to life as the NATO troops opened fire, their newfound war machines unleashing a **storm of steel and plasma** upon the battlefield.
