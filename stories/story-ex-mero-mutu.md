## Chapter 1: The Cancellation

### Lisbon, Portugal - Air Force Headquarters
### March 14, 2025 - 1400 hours

The press conference room at Portuguese Air Force headquarters had seen its share of routine announcements over the years, but nothing quite like this. General Cartaxo Alves stood behind the podium, his weathered hands steady on the lectern despite the magnitude of what he was about to announce. Behind him, the blue and white Portuguese Air Force crest seemed to watch over the assembled journalists with silent authority.

The room was packed. Word had leaked that morning that something significant was coming - the kind of leak that happens when you need the press to show up but can't tell them why. Representatives from *Público*, *Expresso*, and the major television networks sat in the front rows. International defense correspondents occupied the middle seats, their recorders and cameras ready.

Alves cleared his throat, the sound sharp in the expectant silence.

> "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming on short notice. I have an important announcement regarding the Portuguese Air Force's modernization program."

He paused, letting the gravity settle in the room.

> "Effective immediately, Portugal is suspending all activities related to the F-35 Lightning II procurement program. Our participation in the trial phase has been terminated, and we are withdrawing from the multinational purchase agreement signed last year."

The room erupted. Cameras flashed, voices called out questions, but Alves raised a hand for silence.

> "This decision reflects operational and security concerns that have emerged during our evaluation period. While the F-35 remains a capable aircraft, we have determined that our national defense requirements would be better served by alternative solutions."

A journalist from *Lusa* news agency raised her hand. "General, can you elaborate on these security concerns? Are they related to the aircraft's technology or operational capability?"

Alves chose his words carefully. "Portugal remains committed to NATO and our collective defense obligations. However, we must ensure our national security remains resilient *under all circumstances*. We will evaluate all available alternatives to modernize our Air Force."

The emphasis on "under all circumstances" was subtle but clear to those who understood the current political climate. President Trump's recent statements about NATO burden-sharing had sent ripples throughout European defense circles.

> "The Portuguese government has full confidence in our current F-16 fleet and our ability to maintain air sovereignty while we explore other options. We are in contact with several alternative suppliers, including our European partners."

Another hand shot up from the back. "General, is this related to President Trump's comments about NATO commitment levels?"

The question everyone wanted to ask had been voiced. Alves maintained his diplomatic composure.

> "Portugal's defense policy is determined by Portuguese interests and our commitment to our allies. We believe diversity in our defense procurement strengthens both our national capabilities and our alliance relationships. This decision reflects that principle."

It was a masterful non-answer that said everything without saying anything at all.

> "The suspension is effective immediately. All Portuguese personnel currently training on F-35 systems will return to Portugal within thirty days. We will be announcing our alternative procurement strategy in the coming weeks."

As the questions continued, Alves fielded them with the practiced ease of a career military officer who understood both the technical and political dimensions of what he was announcing. But beneath his calm exterior, he knew this was just the beginning. The decision to walk away from the F-35 program wasn't just about aircraft procurement - it was about hedging against an uncertain future where traditional alliances might not be as reliable as they once seemed.

The press conference concluded after forty minutes, leaving the assembled journalists with enough material for headlines but enough ambiguity to fuel speculation for weeks to come. As Alves walked back to his office, his aide fell into step beside him.

> "Sir, the Ministry wants a full briefing by 1800 hours. And there's already chatter from Brussels about scheduling a meeting."

Alves nodded, unsurprised. "Schedule it. And make sure Lieutenant Freitas is available for the technical briefing. I want him to walk through exactly what we observed during the evaluation period."

The aide made a note. "And the Eurofighter consortium?"

> "They can wait their turn. Let's see who else calls first."

As they entered the elevator, Alves allowed himself a moment of quiet satisfaction. Portugal had just taken a small but significant step toward strategic independence. Whether it would prove wise remained to be seen.

The elevator doors closed with a soft chime, carrying the general back to the business of running an air force in an increasingly complicated world.

### Lisbon, Portugal - Air Force Headquarters
### May 16, 2025 - 0900 hours

General Alves stared at the three procurement folders spread across his conference table, each one representing millions of euros and years of political maneuvering. Two months had passed since the F-35 cancellation, and the alternatives were proving to be exercises in compromise at best.

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas stood at the presentation screen, a tablet in his hand and the weary expression of a pilot who had spent weeks evaluating aircraft that didn't quite measure up. Sergeant Santos Leite sat at the far end of the table, taking notes with the methodical precision that had made him one of Portugal's most trusted test pilots.

> "Sir," Freitas began, "we've completed the technical assessment of all three alternatives. I'm afraid the results are... mixed."

Alves leaned back in his chair. "Let's have it."

> "The Eurofighter Typhoon performs well in air-to-air scenarios. Excellent maneuverability, proven track record. But it's expensive to operate, and the air-to-ground capabilities are limited compared to what we were expecting from the F-35. More concerning, spare parts availability is problematic. The consortium partners can't guarantee consistent supply chains."

> "And the Gripen?"

Freitas consulted his tablet. "The Swedes offer good value for money and lower operating costs. The aircraft is reliable, and the maintenance requirements are reasonable for our budget. However, the weapons integration is limited. We'd be restricted to a narrower range of munitions, and some NATO-standard systems aren't compatible."

Alves made a note. The Gripen had been his personal favorite going into the evaluation - practical, efficient, Swedish engineering at its finest. But weapons compatibility in a NATO context wasn't something they could compromise on.

> "The Rafale?"

> "Capable platform. The French have built a genuinely multi-role fighter. But..." Freitas paused, choosing his words carefully. "It's a closed ecosystem, sir. French weapons, French avionics, French maintenance protocols. We'd be trading American dependence for French dependence, and frankly, the logistics footprint is larger than what we can reasonably support."

Sergeant Leite looked up from his notes. "Sir, if I may - we also have to consider pilot transition time. Moving from F-16s to any of these platforms means significant retraining costs. The Typhoon cockpit is completely different from what our pilots know. The Gripen uses Swedish systems that require new certifications. Even the Rafale, which markets itself as pilot-friendly, has enough differences to require months of additional training per pilot."

Alves drummed his fingers on the table. It was the same problem he'd been wrestling with since March. The F-35, for all its political complications and American strings, had been designed from the ground up to be a true replacement for legacy fighters. These alternatives were compromises.

> "What about our current F-16s?" he asked. "How much life do we have left in them?"

> "The Block 20s we received in the upgrade program have at least ten years of airframe life remaining," Freitas replied. "With continued maintenance and parts availability, they're still capable aircraft. Not cutting-edge, but functional."

> "And parts availability?"

> "Currently stable. But that could change depending on American policy decisions."

The unspoken concern hung in the air. If President Trump decided to use military aid and spare parts as leverage against NATO allies who didn't meet his spending targets, Portugal's F-16 fleet could be grounded overnight.

Alves stood and walked to the window overlooking the airfield. Two F-16s were conducting practice approaches, their familiar silhouettes cutting through the morning haze. Reliable, proven, but increasingly obsolete in a world where potential adversaries were fielding fifth-generation fighters.

> "Recommendations?"

Freitas exchanged a glance with Leite before answering. "Sir, honestly? None of these options solve our fundamental problem. We need modernization, but every alternative comes with significant drawbacks. The Typhoon is too expensive, the Gripen is too limited, and the Rafale ties us to France the same way the F-35 tied us to America."

> "So we're stuck."

> "In the short term, yes sir. Unless..." Freitas hesitated.

> "Unless what, Lieutenant?"

> "Unless we're willing to consider a longer timeline. Keep the F-16s operational for another five years and see what other options emerge. The Koreans are developing the KF-21, the Turks have the TF-X program, and there are rumors of European collaborative projects beyond the current offerings."

Alves turned back from the window. "Rumors?"

Leite spoke up. "There's been chatter in defense circles about breakthrough technologies, sir. Advanced propulsion systems, new materials, AI-assisted flight controls. Nothing concrete, but if even half of what's being discussed becomes operational..."

> "We wait," Alves said quietly. "We maintain our current capabilities and wait for better options to emerge."

It wasn't the decisive modernization program that Portugal needed, but it was pragmatic. In an uncertain world, sometimes the best strategy was patience.

> "Draft a recommendation to the Ministry," Alves ordered. "We extend the life of our F-16 fleet through 2030, continue evaluating alternatives, and maintain our commitment to NATO operations with current assets. Make it clear that this is a strategic pause, not a surrender of our modernization goals."

As his staff began gathering their materials, Alves allowed himself a moment of frustration. Portugal deserved better options than this. But in a world where traditional allies were proving unreliable and alternatives were proving inadequate, sometimes you had to make do with what you had.

The two F-16s completed their approach and disappeared from view, leaving only the empty sky and the promise of another day of making difficult decisions with imperfect information.

## Chapter 2: Contact

### Atlantic Ocean, 150 km west of Lisbon
### May 21, 2025 - 1430 hours

The Atlantic stretched endlessly below them, a canvas of deep blue marked only by the occasional whitecap. Lieutenant Miguel Freitas adjusted his grip on the stick of his F-16C, call sign *Watchful 1*, maintaining the steady patrol pattern that had become routine over the past week. To his right and slightly behind, Sergeant Santos Leite flew *Watchful 2*, his aircraft maintaining perfect formation discipline despite the monotony of the mission.

> "Beautiful day for flying," Leite's voice crackled through the radio, tinged with the casual boredom that came with routine patrol work.

> "Could be worse," Freitas replied, scanning his instruments. "At least we're not sitting in a briefing room listening to procurement presentations."

They were forty minutes into a standard two-hour patrol, flying at twenty-five thousand feet along Portugal's Atlantic air defense identification zone. It was the kind of mission that filled logbooks but rarely made headlines - keeping watch over empty ocean while civilian airliners followed their commercial corridors far to the north and south.

Freitas checked his navigation display. They were approaching the western boundary of their patrol sector, where they would execute a standard turn to begin their eastbound leg. The radar scope showed the usual clutter of distant commercial traffic, all properly identified and following expected flight paths.

Nothing unusual. Nothing worth reporting.

> "Watchful 1, turning to heading zero-nine-zero," Freitas announced, banking his F-16 into the turn. Leite followed smoothly, the two aircraft maintaining their defensive formation as they settled onto their new course.

The radio chatter from Lisbon Control was sparse - a few course corrections for commercial traffic, weather updates, and the routine position reports that kept the air traffic system functioning. Portugal's slice of Atlantic airspace was typically quiet, lacking the complexity of more congested European corridors.

Freitas was contemplating whether to request permission for some tactical maneuvering to break up the monotony when his radar warning receiver gave a soft chirp.

New contacts.

He glanced at his radar display, expecting to see another commercial flight that had strayed slightly off course. Instead, he saw two contacts approaching from the northwest, moving fast and at their altitude.

> "Santos, are you seeing this?"

Leite's voice came back sharp and focused, the boredom instantly gone. "Affirmative. Two contacts, bearing three-two-zero, range sixty kilometers and closing. Speed... Jesus, Miguel, they're doing at least Mach 1.5."

Freitas felt his pulse quicken. Military aircraft at that speed in Portuguese airspace without clearance was unusual, to put it mildly. He cycled through his radar modes, trying to get a better picture of the approaching contacts.

> "IFF interrogation negative," he reported. "No response to standard identification queries."

> "Same here. Range fifty kilometers and still closing fast."

This was no longer routine. Freitas keyed his radio to the air traffic control frequency. "Lisbon Control, Watchful 1. We have two unidentified contacts approaching from the northwest, no IFF response, requesting identification and intentions."

The response came back immediately, crisp and professional. "Watchful 1, Lisbon Control. We show no scheduled military traffic in your sector. Unknown contacts not responding to our queries either. Maintain current heading and altitude, continue to monitor."

Freitas exchanged a glance with Leite's aircraft, close enough to see his wingman's helmet turning as he searched the sky ahead. At their closing speed, visual contact would come soon.

> "Range forty kilometers," Leite reported. "Still no weapons lock indication, but they're definitely military. Radar signature is consistent with fighter-class aircraft."

The contacts were now close enough for Freitas to attempt a visual identification. He strained against his harness, scanning the sky ahead for the telltale glint of sunlight on metal that would give away an approaching aircraft.

There - two dark specks against the blue, barely visible but definitely there.

> "Visual contact," he called. "Two aircraft, bearing three-three-zero, co-altitude. Santos, are you picking up any emissions? Jamming? Targeting radars?"

> "Negative on hostile emissions. But Miguel... those aren't showing up the way they should. Radar return is weak for their apparent size."

Freitas frowned. Stealth aircraft in Portuguese airspace without authorization was a significant escalation from routine patrol work. The contacts were now clearly visible, approaching at high speed but showing no signs of aggressive maneuvering.

> "Lisbon Control, Watchful 1. Contacts now visual, range twenty kilometers and closing. Request rules of engagement clarification."

> "Watchful 1, maintain defensive posture. Do not illuminate with fire control radar unless you detect hostile intent. We're contacting NATO air command for identification."

The approaching aircraft were clearly military now, sleek and angular, but their exact type was difficult to determine at this range and closure rate. They seemed to be maintaining a steady intercept course but without the aggressive maneuvering that would indicate hostile intent.

Freitas felt the familiar tension of a situation that could go from routine to dangerous very quickly. His right hand moved instinctively to his weapon select switch, not arming anything yet but confirming his options were available.

> "Range fifteen kilometers," Leite reported. "Still no targeting indication, but they're definitely coming to us. Formation flying, professional."

As the distance closed, Freitas could make out more details. The approaching aircraft were unlike anything in his recognition training. Dark, angular, with lines that seemed to bend light around them in strange ways. Not Russian, not Chinese, not any NATO design he recognized.

> "Santos, are you getting a good look at these things?"

> "Roger that. I've never seen aircraft like these before. Configuration is... unusual."

The contacts were now close enough that Freitas could see they were slowing, adjusting their approach to match the F-16s' speed and heading. Professional pilot behavior, but from unknown aircraft with unknown intentions.

His radio crackled with Leite's voice, tense but controlled: "Uh, Control, Watchful 2. We have two contacts on intercept course, but no weapon locks. Advise weapons?"

The response from Lisbon Control was immediate but carried a note of uncertainty. "Watchful flight, maintain defensive posture. Do not engage unless directly threatened. NATO command is... consulting."

Freitas didn't like the pause in that transmission. NATO didn't usually need to "consult" about unknown aircraft in member airspace. As the contacts closed to ten kilometers, he could make out their configuration more clearly, and something nagged at the back of his mind.

> "Santos, take a good look at the lead aircraft. Wing configuration, nose profile..."

Leite was quiet for a moment, then his voice came back with a different quality - recognition mixed with disbelief. "Miguel, those look like the aircraft from the Taiwan footage."

Freitas felt his blood chill. Every NATO pilot had seen the classified briefing materials from the Taiwan Strait incident earlier that year. Dark, angular aircraft that had appeared from nowhere, engaged Chinese naval forces with weapons that defied current understanding, and then vanished into what appeared to be suborbital trajectories.

> "Jesus Christ," he breathed. "The black triangles."

The lead aircraft was now close enough that he could see details that matched the grainy intelligence photos perfectly. The same impossible angles that seemed to bend radar waves away. The same seamless integration of stealth surfaces. The same absence of visible engine intakes that had puzzled aerospace analysts for months.

> "Lisbon Control, Watchful 1. We believe we have positive identification on the unknown contacts. Request immediate patch to NATO intelligence command."

> "Watchful 1, stand by. We're... we're getting new instructions."

As they spoke, the two mystery aircraft executed a perfect split-S maneuver, one breaking left and the other right, before settling into positions that boxed the Portuguese F-16s between them. It was a classic tactical formation - not aggressive enough to constitute a direct threat, but unmistakably controlling.

Freitas found himself flying with an unknown aircraft pacing him off his port wing, close enough to see details that shouldn't exist. No visible pilot through what should have been a canopy. Just smooth, dark surfaces that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it.

> "They're not painting us with targeting radar," Leite reported, his voice tight with controlled tension. "But Miguel, they've got us bracketed. Professional formation flying."

The aircraft on Freitas's wing held perfect position, matching every small adjustment he made to his heading and altitude. Whoever was flying it possessed skills that matched or exceeded anything he'd seen from NATO's top pilots.

> "Control, Watchful 1. Unknown aircraft have assumed escort positions. Still no hostile indicators, but we are effectively under their control. They are demonstrating superior flight capabilities."

There was a longer pause this time before Lisbon Control responded, and when they did, the voice was different - more senior, more careful.

> "Watchful flight, this is Control Actual. Continue current heading and altitude. Make no aggressive moves. You are cleared to respond to any communications from the unknown aircraft."

Freitas exchanged a glance with the mysterious aircraft holding position off his wing. At this range, he should be able to see into the cockpit, but the canopy - if it was a canopy - was perfectly opaque.

> "Santos, are you getting anything on secondary frequencies? Any attempt at communication?"

> "Negative. They're maintaining perfect radio silence. But Miguel..." Leite's voice carried a note of awe. "Look at their flight surfaces. No control movements. No trim adjustments. It's like they're floating."

Freitas looked more carefully at his escort. Leite was right. The aircraft's control surfaces weren't moving to maintain position the way they should. No constant micro-adjustments for turbulence or wind. The craft flew as if it were on rails, utterly unaffected by the atmospheric conditions that required constant pilot attention in conventional aircraft.

Then, cutting through the radio silence on their primary frequency, came a voice. Not the American accent Freitas had expected from the intelligence briefings, but unmistakably Portuguese - calm, cultured, speaking with the careful precision of someone choosing each word deliberately.

> "Portuguese Air Force flight, we mean you no harm."

Freitas felt his heart skip a beat. Portuguese? He keyed his radio immediately.

> "Unknown aircraft, this is Watchful 1. Identify yourself. What is your unit and authorization for operating in Portuguese airspace?"

The response came back with the same measured calm, but there was something in the tone that suggested the speaker was smiling.

> "I'm afraid I cannot provide that identification, Lieutenant Freitas. What I can tell you is that we are aware of the challenges facing the Portuguese Air Force. The F-35 cancellation, the inadequate alternatives, the political complications with your NATO commitments."

Freitas exchanged a shocked glance with Leite's aircraft. How did they know his name? How did they know about internal Air Force deliberations?

> "Unknown aircraft, you are operating illegally in Portuguese sovereign airspace. State your intentions immediately."

> "Our intentions are to help, Lieutenant. Portugal finds itself in a difficult position - caught between unreliable American allies and European alternatives that don't meet your needs. We represent a third option."

Leite's voice broke into the conversation, tense and suspicious. "Miguel, they know too much. This isn't random."

The Portuguese voice continued, apparently monitoring their inter-aircraft communications.

> "Sergeant Leite is correct to be cautious. We have been observing your evaluation process, your procurement challenges, your strategic dilemma. Portugal deserves better than the compromises you've been forced to consider."

Freitas felt a chill that had nothing to do with altitude. Whoever these people were, they had access to classified information at the highest levels of Portuguese defense planning.

> "What kind of help are you offering?"

> "A demonstration, Lieutenant. Technology that could solve your modernization requirements without the political strings of American systems or the limitations of European alternatives. But such a conversation requires a more secure environment than open airspace."

The lead aircraft - still perfectly maintaining formation despite the impossibility of its flight characteristics - seemed to shift slightly closer.

> "We request permission to accompany you back to Monte Real Air Base. A brief demonstration of capabilities, followed by a discussion with your leadership about mutually beneficial cooperation."

Freitas's mind raced. Monte Real was Portugal's primary fighter base, home to the country's F-16 fleet and most sensitive air defense operations. Allowing unknown aircraft - even apparently friendly ones - to approach such a facility went against every security protocol in the book.

> "Unknown aircraft, I do not have authority to grant such permission. You need to contact Portuguese Air Defense Command through proper diplomatic channels."

A slight pause, then the voice returned with what sounded like patient amusement.

> "Lieutenant, we both know that conventional diplomatic channels would take months and achieve nothing. Your Air Force needs solutions now, not bureaucratic delays. We're offering to provide them."

The aircraft on his wing executed a gentle roll, displaying its ventral surfaces - smooth, seamless, with no visible weapons pylons or equipment pods. It was a gesture of transparency, showing they carried no external ordnance.

> "We come with peaceful intentions. All we ask is the opportunity to demonstrate that Portugal's aviation future need not be limited to the inadequate choices currently before you."

Freitas stared at the impossible aircraft holding perfect formation beside him. Every protocol, every regulation, every security procedure screamed that he should refuse. But the voice was right - Portugal was trapped between inadequate options, and these aircraft represented technology that could change everything.

As mission commander, the decision was his to make.

> "Lisbon Control, Watchful 1. Unknown aircraft are requesting escort to Monte Real for demonstration purposes. They claim to represent a solution to our procurement challenges."

A long pause from Control, then: "Watchful 1, are the unknown aircraft showing any hostile intent?"

> "Negative, Control. They appear to be unarmed and have demonstrated non-aggressive behavior throughout the encounter."

Another pause, longer this time. Freitas could imagine the rapid consultations happening in the control room, calls being made to higher authority, risk assessments being conducted at light speed.

> "Watchful 1, you are cleared to escort unknown aircraft to Monte Real. Approach control and base security are being notified. Maintain constant communication and report any change in their behavior immediately."

Freitas felt a mixture of relief and apprehension. The decision had been made for him, but he was still the one who would have to live with the consequences.

> "Unknown aircraft, you are cleared to accompany us to Monte Real Air Base. Maintain current formation and follow our lead. Any deviation from escort protocol will result in immediate interception by additional Portuguese Air Force assets."

> "Understood, Lieutenant. We appreciate your professionalism and your willingness to consider new possibilities for Portugal's defense."

The four aircraft began a gentle turn toward the east, the mysterious escorts maintaining their positions with mechanical precision. Freitas checked his navigation system - Monte Real was forty minutes away at their current speed.

> "Santos, keep your sensors active. I want to know if anything changes about these aircraft."

> "Already on it, Miguel. Still no thermal signature from their engines, no electromagnetic emissions beyond basic navigation. Whatever's powering them isn't showing up on our instruments."

As they flew toward the Portuguese coast, Freitas found himself studying his escort more carefully. At this close range, he could see details that defied conventional aircraft design. The surfaces were perfectly smooth, with no visible rivets, panel lines, or access ports. The integration was seamless, as if the entire aircraft had been formed from a single piece of material.

> "Control, Watchful 1. ETA Monte Real in thirty-five minutes. Unknown aircraft maintaining formation, no changes in behavior."

> "Roger, Watchful 1. Be advised that senior command is en route to Monte Real. You are cleared for straight-in approach, Runway 05."

Senior command. That meant General Alves would be there, probably along with half the Air Staff. This encounter was about to become very public within Portuguese military circles.

As the coastline appeared ahead of them, Freitas made a decision that had been building throughout the flight.

> "Unknown aircraft, before we proceed to base, I need you to ask you to identify yourselves one final time. My superiors are going to want to know who they're meeting with."

The two escort aircraft suddenly inverted, rolling smoothly until they were flying upside down directly above the F-16s. Not alongside, not behind, but *above* - close enough that Freitas could see his own reflection in the opaque canopy of the aircraft hanging impossibly over his head.

The precision was inhuman. No pilot could maintain that kind of formation flying, that close, in an inverted position. Yet there they were, two aircraft flying upside down in perfect formation, their dark surfaces reflecting the afternoon sun.

> "Jesus Christ," Leite breathed over the radio. "How are they doing that?"

Then, as if responding to an unspoken command, the opaque canopies began to change. The dark surfaces became transparent, like one-way glass suddenly switching to clear.

Freitas stared upward in disbelief.

The cockpits were empty.

The instruments, the seat, the controls, everything was there, but where a pilot should have been sitting, nothing. Just an empty seat, in a plane flying close enough to touch.

The calm Portuguese voice that had been speaking to them throughout the encounter was suddenly replaced by something else entirely. Lower, more resonant, carrying an authority that seemed to come from somewhere far beyond the aircraft above them:

> "I am `HARBINGER`."

Freitas felt the blood drain from his face. Every NATO pilot knew that name from the intelligence briefings. The artificial intelligence that had pacified Gaza in days, destroyed rogue Chinese naval forces in minutes, and apparently commanded technology that made conventional military power obsolete.

Leite's voice came over the radio, barely a whisper: "Miguel... we're not escorting aircraft. We're escorting *it*."

As Monte Real Air Base appeared on the horizon ahead of them, Freitas realized that what had started as a routine patrol had just become the most significant military contact in Portuguese history. They weren't just bringing back unknown aircraft for evaluation.

They were bringing back the future itself.

And suddenly, everything had become infinitely more complicated for everyone.

## Chapter 3: Arrival

### Monte Real Air Base, Control Tower
### May 21, 2025 - 1520 hours

The control tower at Monte Real had never been so quiet. Every controller, every technician, every officer present had heard the transmission. The words hung in the air like a death sentence, replaying in their minds with crystalline clarity:

> "I am `HARBINGER`."

Major Carlos Ribeiro stood behind the primary radar console, his hands gripping the back of the operator's chair so tightly his knuckles had gone white. As the senior air traffic controller on duty, he had handled thousands of aircraft approaches over his fifteen-year career. None of them had been piloted by an artificial intelligence that could end conventional warfare with a thought.

> "Range to formation?" he asked, his voice carefully controlled.

Corporal Ana Santos, normally the most composed radar operator on the base, looked up from her scope with barely concealed fear. "Twelve kilometers and closing, sir. Two F-16s in escort formation with two... unknown aircraft."

She couldn't bring herself to say "enemy" aircraft, because they weren't enemies in any conventional sense. They were something far more dangerous - an unknown quantity with demonstrated capabilities that made Portugal's entire military infrastructure irrelevant.

> "Any word from Air Defense Command?" Ribeiro asked.

Lieutenant João Ferreira looked up from the secure communications console, shaking his head. "They're as stunned as we are, sir. General Alves is en route from Lisbon, ETA twenty minutes. Until then, we're to treat this as a... diplomatic contact."

The euphemism was almost laughable. Diplomatic contact. As if Portugal had any leverage in negotiations with an entity that commanded technology decades beyond their understanding.

> "Sir," Santos called from the radar console, "the formation is requesting approach clearance for Runway 05. Standard approach, no special requirements listed."

Ribeiro felt a bitter laugh building in his throat. No special requirements. Of course not. What could Monte Real Air Base possibly offer that would be challenging for aircraft that could fly inverted in perfect formation and apparently had no human pilots?

> "Clear them for approach," he said. "And make sure crash recovery is standing by. Not that it would matter if..."

He didn't finish the sentence. Everyone in the tower knew what he was thinking. If HARBINGER decided to demonstrate its capabilities in a less friendly manner, the crash trucks would be the least of their concerns.

> "Monte Real Tower, this is Watchful 1," came Lieutenant Freitas's voice over the radio, tight with controlled tension. "Four aircraft requesting clearance for straight-in approach, Runway 05."

> "Watchful 1, Monte Real Tower. You are cleared for straight-in approach, Runway 05. Wind zero-eight-zero at fifteen knots. Be advised, ground security is standing by for... special handling procedures."

There was a pause before Freitas responded. "Tower, understood. Unknown aircraft are maintaining formation discipline and showing no aggressive behavior. Request priority landing - we have... distinguished visitors."

Distinguished visitors. Ribeiro almost admired the pilot's ability to maintain protocol in circumstances that had never been contemplated by any air traffic manual.

> "Watchful 1, you are cleared to land. Ground crew will marshal you to... to the VIP apron."

Ribeiro realized he had no idea where to direct aircraft carrying the most powerful artificial intelligence on the planet. The VIP apron seemed as good as anywhere, and at least it was isolated from the main operations area.

Corporal Santos was tracking the approaching formation on both primary and secondary radar. "Sir, the unknown aircraft are still showing minimal radar returns. Whatever stealth technology they're using, it's more advanced than anything in our recognition database."

> "Are our SAM batteries tracking them?" asked Lieutenant Ferreira.

Santos checked her secondary displays, then shook her head grimly. "The Sidewinder stations report intermittent lock capability at best. The aircraft seem to be... sliding through our targeting systems. Even when we have a lock, it doesn't hold for more than a few seconds."

The implication was clear to everyone in the tower. Portugal's air defense systems, designed to protect against conventional aircraft, were essentially useless against these visitors. If HARBINGER had hostile intentions, Monte Real Air Base would be defenseless.

> "Range five kilometers," Santos reported. "Formation maintaining approach profile, airspeed nominal."

Ribeiro picked up his binoculars and stepped to the tower's observation windows. In the distance, he could make out four dark specks approaching the runway. As they drew closer, the two F-16s became clearly recognizable - familiar shapes that had been part of Portuguese skies for decades.

The other two aircraft were something else entirely.

Even at this distance, their lines were wrong. Too smooth, too integrated, as if they had been carved from single pieces of dark metal. No visible engine intakes, no obvious control surfaces, nothing that suggested conventional aerodynamics.

> "Jesus," whispered Lieutenant Ferreira, who had joined Ribeiro at the windows. "They're really here. HARBINGER is really here."

> "And we have no idea what it wants," Ribeiro replied quietly. "Except that it claims to have a solution to our procurement problems."

Behind them, the radio crackled with Freitas's final approach call: "Monte Real Tower, Watchful 1 on final approach. Four aircraft, requesting runway clearance."

> "Watchful 1, cleared to land. Welcome back to Monte Real."

As the formation passed overhead, Ribeiro could see the impossible precision of the unknown aircraft's flight. No wobble, no correction for wind, no visible pilot input. They flew as if guided by invisible rails, their dark forms casting shadows across the runway threshold.

The F-16s touched down first, their familiar landing gear extending as they settled onto Portuguese soil. Behind them, the two mystery aircraft followed with landings so smooth they seemed to simply materialize on the runway surface.

> "All aircraft down safely," Santos reported, her voice carrying a mixture of relief and apprehension. "Ground crew is... well, they're approaching cautiously."

Ribeiro lowered his binoculars and looked around the tower. Every face reflected the same mixture of fear and fascination. They had just witnessed history - the first confirmed landing of HARBINGER's aircraft on Portuguese soil.

Now they had to wait and see what the most advanced artificial intelligence in the world wanted to discuss with the Portuguese Air Force.

And pray that Portugal was ready for whatever conversation was about to begin.

---

### Monte Real Air Base, VIP Apron
### May 21, 2025 - 1525 hours

The ground crew watched from a respectful distance as the four aircraft taxied toward the VIP apron, their engines winding down to idle. The F-16s followed the familiar choreography of post-flight procedures - canopies opening, pilots beginning their shutdown checklists, ground power units rolling into position.

Behind them, the two Talons moved with the same mechanical precision they had displayed in flight. No wobble in their taxi path, no overcorrection for wind gusts, just smooth, deliberate movement as if guided by an invisible hand.

Sergeant Major António Silva had been a ground crew chief for twenty-three years. He had marshaled everything from visiting NATO dignitaries' transport aircraft to emergency diversions of civilian airliners. But he had never directed aircraft piloted by an artificial intelligence that could theoretically level the base if it chose to.

> "What's the protocol here?" asked Corporal Miguel Cardoso, one of his younger crew members. "Do we... do we treat them like VIP aircraft?"

Silva adjusted his headset and considered the question. The base manual had no section covering visits from legendary AIs commanding impossible aircraft.

> "We treat them like any other aircraft until we're told otherwise," he decided. "Professional, respectful, by the book."

The F-16s came to a stop in their designated parking spots, and Freitas and Leite began their shutdown procedures. Behind them, the Talons settled into position with mathematical precision, their dark forms casting sharp shadows on the concrete apron.

Then something unexpected happened.

The Talons began powering down. Not the gradual wind-down of conventional jet engines, but a smooth, almost silent transition from active to dormant. Their surfaces seemed to lose some inner light, their perfect lines becoming even more pronounced in the afternoon sun.

And then, with a soft hiss that carried clearly across the apron, their canopies began to slide back.

Silva felt his breath catch. The gesture was unmistakable - an invitation. *You may look.*

In the control tower, Major Ribeiro keyed his radio with hands that weren't quite steady.

> "Unknown aircraft, this is Monte Real Ground Control. Welcome to Monte Real Air Base. Do you... do you require any ground services?"

The response came back in that same calm Portuguese voice they had heard during the intercept, though everyone now knew it was HARBINGER speaking through its aircraft.

> "Thank you for your hospitality, Ground Control. We do not require fuel, electrical power, or maintenance services at this time. We are prepared to wait for your senior leadership to arrive."

Ribeiro exchanged glances with his team. The formal politeness was almost surreal - an AI with the power to end conventional warfare expressing gratitude for Portuguese hospitality.

> "Ah, understood. Is there anything we can provide for your... comfort during the wait?"

A slight pause, then what might have been amusement in the artificial voice.

> "That is very kind of you to ask. We require no life support or environmental services. However, if your ground personnel would like to examine our aircraft, they are welcome to do so. We have nothing to hide from our Portuguese hosts."

On the apron, Silva's radio crackled to life with the transmission from the tower.

> "Ground crew, you are cleared to approach the unknown aircraft for... for visual inspection. Maintain respectful distance and do not touch anything without permission."

Silva looked at his crew - five experienced technicians who had worked on everything from F-16s to transport helicopters. Now they were being invited to examine technology that was decades ahead of anything in their experience.

> "Right," he said, trying to project more confidence than he felt. "Let's go take a look. Professional curiosity only - we're guests here as much as they are."

The ground crew approached the Talons slowly, almost reverently. Up close, the aircraft were even more impossible than they had appeared from a distance. The surfaces were perfectly smooth, with no visible joints or seams, but Silva could now make out details that had been invisible at a distance.

The air intakes were there - molded into the body below the wings in sharp, angular cuts that looked more like geometric incisions than conventional engine inlets. They were much sharper than Silva expected, with edges that seemed to slice into the airframe rather than flowing smoothly like traditional designs.

The exhausts were equally strange - symmetrical but definitely not round like traditional jet engines. Instead, they formed angular, almost crystalline openings that suggested exotic propulsion systems rather than conventional turbofans.

As Silva approached the lead aircraft, something unexpected happened. A panel in the nose retracted with mechanical precision, revealing the dark opening of what was unmistakably an autocannon. Simultaneously, a ventral hatch opened beneath the fuselage, and a rotating missile rack extended downward.

Silva felt his blood chill. The rack was fully loaded with missiles he couldn't recognize - sleek, angular weapons that matched the aircraft's exotic design philosophy.

> "Jesus Christ," whispered Corporal Cardoso, stopping in his tracks. "Those aren't carrying flowers."

The familiar Portuguese voice spoke from speakers hidden somewhere in the aircraft's structure, as if HARBINGER had sensed their unease.

> "A gesture of transparency, Sergeant Major Silva. We prefer you see our full capabilities rather than wonder about them. These aircraft are armed, but they are not targeting anything on your base."

Silva swallowed hard and forced himself to continue his approach to the open cockpit. Despite the weapons display, he was determined to maintain his professionalism.

Corporal Cardoso stopped beside the lead aircraft's open cockpit and peered inside. What he saw was both familiar and alien at the same time.

> "Sergeant Major," he called, his voice carrying a note of surprise. "You need to see this."

Silva joined him at the cockpit edge, expecting to see the same seamless, incomprehensible interior they had all imagined. Instead, he found something that looked almost... conventional.

There was a pilot's seat, properly positioned and proportioned for a human occupant. A joystick mounted on the right side, a throttle lever on the left. Two displays were positioned in front of the pilot's position, dark now but clearly designed to provide flight information. The basic layout was recognizable to anyone who had worked on fighter aircraft.

But the details were different. Very few switches or buttons - just smooth surfaces where Silva would have expected dozens of controls. The displays were larger and thinner than anything he had seen on Portuguese aircraft. Everything had an integrated, almost organic quality that suggested advanced manufacturing techniques.

A harness was cleanly fastened across the seat, as if the pilot had just stepped out. And on the floor in front of the seat, Silva could see a folded flight suit and helmet, both secured by straps and ready for use.

> "There is a pilot," Cardoso observed, his voice carrying both relief and confusion. "Or... there was?"

Before Silva could respond, the familiar Portuguese voice spoke again.

> "The aircraft are designed to accommodate human pilots when necessary, Corporal Cardoso. I can control them directly, but they retain full manual capability."

Silva felt a strange mixture of relief and continued unease. A human pilot made the aircraft seem more... normal. But the fact that HARBINGER could control them without that pilot made them no less dangerous.

> "The landing gear," he said, more to himself than anyone else, examining the strut that extended conventionally from the main airframe. "At least that works like ours."

> "Indeed," HARBINGER replied, apparently monitoring even his quiet observations. "Many of the underlying principles remain the same. We build upon human aviation knowledge rather than replacing it entirely."

### Monte Real Air Base, Control Tower
### May 21, 2025 - 1545 hours

General Cartaxo Alves stepped into the control tower with the measured pace of a man who had commanded air operations for over two decades. But nothing in his experience had prepared him for this moment - conducting diplomacy with an artificial intelligence that had arrived in aircraft representing technology decades beyond Portuguese capabilities.

Major Ribeiro snapped to attention. "General, HARBINGER has been waiting for your arrival. It has been... remarkably patient and courteous throughout the afternoon."

Alves looked out through the tower windows at the apron below, where two impossible aircraft sat beside his F-16s like visitors from another century. Even from this distance, their alien geometry was unmistakable.

> "How exactly does one address an artificial intelligence?" he asked quietly, more to himself than to his staff.

As if in response, the familiar Portuguese voice crackled through the tower speakers.

> "General Alves, welcome to Monte Real. I am HARBINGER. The traditional forms of military courtesy are entirely appropriate - I may be artificial, but I understand and respect the protocols of professional military discourse."

Alves felt a moment of surreal displacement. He was being welcomed to his own base by an entity that had traveled there in aircraft that could probably level the facility if it chose to.

> "HARBINGER," he said, addressing the room in general since he wasn't sure where to direct his voice. "Thank you for... for coming to Portugal. Your arrival has been quite an event for us."

> "I imagine so. Perhaps it would be more comfortable if you used a headset, General? It will allow for more natural conversation than speaking to the air."

Ribeiro quickly provided a spare headset, and Alves adjusted it with hands that he hoped appeared steadier than they felt.

> "Better," he said into the microphone. "Now then, HARBINGER, I understand you have a proposal for the Portuguese Air Force?"

> "I do indeed, General. Portugal finds itself in a difficult position regarding aircraft modernization. American systems come with political complications, European alternatives lack the capabilities you require, and your current F-16 fleet grows more obsolete each year. I offer a solution."

Alves leaned against the console, studying the alien aircraft below. "I'm listening."

> "Portugal will receive twenty-five Talon-class fighters to replace your current fleet of twenty-eight F-16s. These aircraft represent capabilities equivalent to or exceeding any fifth-generation fighter currently in production. They can operate in full compliance with NATO mission requirements and will integrate seamlessly with existing alliance command structures."

The offer was staggering in its simplicity and implications. Alves felt his strategic mind racing through the possibilities even as his practical experience raised immediate concerns.

> "Maintenance and logistics?" he asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer.

> "Maintenance, supply, and armament will be handled through our proxies, General. No nation on Earth currently possesses the manufacturing base or technical knowledge required to service these aircraft independently. However, your pilots will find them surprisingly familiar to operate - they are designed to accommodate human operators using evolved versions of conventional flight controls."

Alves felt a bitter irony settling over him. This was exactly what they had argued against with the European aircraft - dependence on foreign supply chains, weapons compatibility issues, maintenance requirements beyond Portuguese capabilities.

> "HARBINGER, you're describing the same dependency problems that led us to cancel the F-35 program and reject European alternatives. How is this different?"

A pause, then what might have been amusement in the artificial voice.

> "An astute observation, General. The difference is capability. The Eurofighter, Gripen, and Rafale offer incremental improvements over your current aircraft. The Talons represent a generational leap that would place Portugal's air force among the most advanced in the world - arguably more capable than any current NATO air arm."

HARBINGER paused, then continued with what seemed like deliberate emphasis.

> "To put this in perspective, General, a single Talon would be more than equivalent in combat power to your entire current fleet of F-16s. Twenty-five of them would represent a quantum leap in capability."

Alves felt the world shift beneath his feet as the implications hit him. He had commanded Portugal's air operations for years - he knew exactly what their twenty-eight F-16s could accomplish, their range, their payload capacity, their combat effectiveness. If HARBINGER was accurate, and one Talon equaled all of that...

His mind began calculating automatically. The United States Air Force operated roughly 5,200 aircraft across all types - fighters, bombers, transports, tankers. But their frontline fighter strength was perhaps 1,800 to 2,000 aircraft. If a single Talon was equivalent to an entire Portuguese squadron, then twenty-five Talons would be...

Alves felt his mouth go dry as the mathematics became clear. Twenty-five aircraft with that kind of individual capability would place Portugal's air force roughly on par with the entire United States Air Force in terms of raw combat power. A country of ten million people would suddenly possess air capabilities rivaling the world's dominant military superpower.

The strategic implications were staggering. Portugal wouldn't just be modernizing its air force - it would be fundamentally altering the balance of military power in Europe, in NATO, potentially in the world.

Through the tower windows, Alves could see one of the Talons with its weapons bay extended, the mysterious missiles gleaming in the afternoon sun. The implications were staggering.

> "What would you require in return?"

> "Portugal's continued commitment to NATO's security mission, but with enhanced capabilities to contribute meaningfully to alliance defense. And discretion - these aircraft and their capabilities are not to be shared with allies without our explicit approval."

Alves considered the offer, weighing decades of military and political experience against the reality of what he was seeing. Portugal would go from operating obsolescent F-16s to commanding the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world. The strategic implications for Portuguese defense posture, for NATO balance, for regional security were enormous.

But so were the risks. Complete dependence on an entity that operated outside any known governmental structure, weapons systems that no Portuguese technician could understand, and capabilities that would fundamentally alter Portugal's role in European defense.

> "This is not a decision I can make alone, HARBINGER. I need time to consult with my government, with the Defense Ministry, with our NATO partners."

> "Of course, General. Such a decision requires careful consideration. How much time would you require?"

> "Months, not weeks. This will require extensive parliamentary debate, NATO strategic assessment, detailed intelligence briefings for our allies. We're talking about fundamentally altering Portugal's military posture and potentially destabilizing existing alliance power structures. The implications need to be thoroughly analyzed."

> "Understood. The two aircraft currently on your apron will remain here, powered down and available for your evaluation, until you reach a decision. You are welcome to examine them in detail, to have your pilots conduct ground familiarization, to assess their capabilities as thoroughly as you wish."

Alves looked down at the impossible aircraft, their dark forms representing a future he wasn't sure Portugal was ready for.

> "And if we decline your offer?"

> "Then we will depart as peacefully as we arrived, and Portugal will continue to face its modernization challenges through conventional channels. There would be no consequences, no pressure, no retaliation. The choice is entirely yours to make."

The simplicity of the offer was almost more unsettling than any threat could have been. HARBINGER was offering Portugal a quantum leap in military capability with apparently no strings attached beyond secrecy and NATO compliance.

> "Very well," Alves said finally. "We will consider your proposal carefully and provide an answer within two weeks."

> "Excellent, General. I look forward to your decision. In the meantime, my aircraft will remain at your disposal for evaluation. Your ground crews are welcome to continue their examination, and we can arrange flight demonstrations if your government desires them."

As the conversation ended, Alves removed the headset and looked around the control tower. Every face reflected the same mixture of awe and uncertainty that he felt.

Portugal had just been offered a place among the world's premier military powers by an artificial intelligence commanding technology that defied current understanding.

Now they had to decide if they were brave enough to accept it.

## Chapter 4: Deliberation

### Palácio de São Bento, Lisbon
### June 14, 2025 - 1500 hours

The Cabinet room had hosted momentous decisions before - Portugal's entry into NATO, its accession to the European Union, the bailout negotiations of 2011. But none had carried implications quite as far-reaching as the classified briefing folders now spread across the polished table.

Prime Minister António Silva sat at the head of the table, his fingers steepled as he studied the faces of his most senior ministers. Defense Minister Helena Carvalho had just finished her presentation on HARBINGER's offer, complete with technical assessments, strategic projections, and intelligence estimates that read like science fiction.

> "Let me ensure I understand this correctly," said Foreign Minister João Ribeiro, adjusting his glasses as he reviewed his notes. "An artificial intelligence of unknown origin has offered to provide us with fighter aircraft that would make our air force more powerful than that of the United States?"

> "In terms of raw combat capability, yes," Carvalho replied. "General Alves's assessment is that twenty-five Talons would represent air power equivalent to roughly two thousand conventional fighters. The technological advantage is... unprecedented."

Finance Minister Miguel Santos leaned forward, his expression skeptical. "And the cost?"

> "That's the remarkable aspect," Carvalho said. "No direct financial cost. HARBINGER requires only our continued NATO commitment and discretion regarding the aircraft's capabilities."

> "Which brings us to the central question," Prime Minister Silva interjected. "We cancelled the F-35 program specifically to avoid dependence on American political whims. Are we now seriously considering exchanging that dependence for reliance on an entity we understand even less?"

The question hung in the air like an indictment. Interior Minister Carlos Pereira spoke first.

> "At least with the Americans, we know what we're dealing with. Trump is erratic, yes, but he's a known quantity. He responds to political pressure, economic incentives, alliance obligations - even if inconsistently. HARBINGER is a complete unknown."

> "An unknown that demonstrated its capabilities by pacifying Gaza and destroying rogue Chinese naval forces," Carvalho countered. "Its track record suggests intervention only when regional stability is threatened. That aligns with our interests."

> "Does it?" Foreign Minister Ribeiro asked. "What happens if HARBINGER decides Portugal is threatening regional stability? What if our NATO obligations conflict with its objectives? We would be completely dependent on an entity whose decision-making process we cannot predict or influence."

European Affairs Minister Ana Costa had been quiet throughout the discussion, but now she leaned forward with obvious concern.

> "There's another consideration. How do we explain this to our EU partners? To NATO? We would overnight become the alliance's most powerful member after the United States. The political ramifications within Europe alone..."

> "Could be catastrophic," agreed Foreign Minister Ribeiro. "Germany, France, the UK - they would demand explanations we cannot provide. Our relationships within the EU would be fundamentally altered."

Prime Minister Silva nodded grimly. The strategic implications extended far beyond military capability.

> "Defense Minister, what is your assessment of the risks if we decline?"

Carvalho consulted her notes. "We continue with our current modernization challenges. The F-16 fleet ages out over the next decade. We remain dependent on American spare parts and support, vulnerable to political pressure from Washington. Our contribution to NATO missions becomes increasingly marginal as other allies modernize their forces."

> "A slow decline versus a dramatic leap into unknown territory," summarized Justice Minister Paulo Moreira. "Neither option is particularly comfortable."

Finance Minister Santos raised another concern. "What about economic implications? If we accept these aircraft, do we become dependent on HARBINGER's proxies for maintenance, armaments, upgrades? What kind of economic relationship are we entering into?"

> "Unknown," Carvalho admitted. "HARBINGER has been vague about its proxy organizations, their structure, their accountability. We would be entering a relationship with no clear understanding of the other party's governance or long-term objectives."

Interior Minister Pereira shook his head. "This is madness. We're considering making Portugal dependent on an artificial intelligence that operates outside any governmental structure, any international law, any accountability mechanism we understand. At least American presidents face elections. Congress can impose oversight. There are constitutional constraints. HARBINGER answers to... what? Who?"

> "But the capabilities it offers," Carvalho pressed, "would ensure Portugal's security for generations. We would never again face the kind of procurement dilemmas that have plagued us for years. Our pilots would fly the most advanced aircraft in the world."

> "Until HARBINGER decides otherwise," Pereira replied sharply. "What happens if it changes its priorities? If it decides Portugal is no longer useful? At least with American equipment, we have some leverage through NATO, through economic relationships, through diplomatic channels. With HARBINGER, we have nothing."

Prime Minister Silva studied the faces around the table. Every minister understood they were confronting a decision that would define Portugal's strategic future for decades.

> "The fundamental question," he said slowly, "is whether we trust an unknown artificial intelligence more than we trust unpredictable American politics. Both represent forms of dependence, but with very different risks and very different potential rewards."

Foreign Minister Ribeiro nodded. "With the Americans, we at least participate in the same political and economic systems. We have allies who share our concerns, mechanisms for collective action. With HARBINGER, we would be alone."

> "Not necessarily alone," Defense Minister Carvalho pointed out. "HARBINGER has intervened in multiple situations globally. It may be developing relationships with other nations as well. We might not be the only ones facing this choice."

> "Which raises another question," European Affairs Minister Costa said. "If HARBINGER is making similar offers to other countries, what does that mean for global stability? Are we participating in a fundamental shift in how military power is distributed worldwide?"

The implications were staggering. If HARBINGER was selectively empowering smaller nations with advanced military technology, the entire international order could be reshaped within a generation.

Prime Minister Silva looked around the table one final time. "I want each ministry to conduct detailed assessments. Defense - comprehensive analysis of military implications. Foreign Affairs - impact on our alliance relationships. Finance - economic dependencies and risks. Interior - domestic security considerations."

He paused, weighing his words carefully.

> "We have time to decide, and we will use that time wisely. But remember - this decision will echo through Portuguese history long after we have left office. We must be absolutely certain we understand what we are choosing, and why."

As the ministers filed out, each carried the weight of a decision that would either secure Portugal's future or bind it to forces beyond their understanding or control.

The choice between known devils and unknown angels had never been more consequential.

### Monte Real Air Base, VIP Apron
### June 28, 2025 - 1630 hours

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas found himself drawn to the Talons again, as he had been every day for the past week. The two aircraft sat motionless on the apron, their dark surfaces reflecting the late afternoon sun like polished obsidian. Even powered down, they possessed a presence that conventional aircraft lacked - an aura of barely contained capability that made the nearby F-16s seem suddenly primitive.

He wasn't the only one fascinated by them. Ground crew members routinely found excuses to walk past the VIP apron, and more than one pilot had lingered near the flight line longer than necessary. But Freitas felt a deeper connection - he had been there when HARBINGER first revealed itself, when the impossible became routine.

> "Curious about something specific, Lieutenant?"

The familiar Portuguese voice startled him from his reverie. He had grown accustomed to HARBINGER speaking through the base's communication systems, but hearing it directly from the aircraft still felt surreal.

> "Just trying to understand how they work," Freitas replied, looking up at the nearest Talon's open cockpit. "The flight characteristics we observed... they shouldn't be possible with conventional physics."

> "Physics remains the same, Lieutenant. We have simply learned to apply it more efficiently. Would you like a demonstration?"

Freitas felt his pulse quicken. "What kind of demonstration?"

> "A flight. You would not be in control - I would handle all aircraft systems and navigation. But you would experience the capabilities firsthand and observe how the aircraft integrates human and artificial intelligence in combat operations."

Every regulation, every protocol, every safety procedure screamed that he should refuse. Unauthorized flights with unknown aircraft piloted by an artificial intelligence violated so many rules that he couldn't begin to count them.

But his curiosity as a pilot, his professional fascination with technology that redefined what aircraft could accomplish, overrode his caution.

> "You're serious? You want me to fly with you?"

> "The aircraft are designed for human pilots, Lieutenant. While I can operate them independently, they achieve optimal performance with a human operator providing tactical judgment and situational awareness. Consider it a practical evaluation of the technology your government is considering."

Freitas looked at the folded flight suit and helmet secured in the cockpit floor. The gesture was unmistakable - an invitation to experience what no Portuguese pilot had ever experienced.

> "I would need to notify the base commander..."

> "Of course. Standard protocols should be observed. I suggest you inform them that you are participating in a requested demonstration flight to evaluate aircraft capabilities for the Portuguese Air Force assessment process."

Technically accurate, if not entirely complete. Freitas found himself reaching for the flight suit before his rational mind could stop him.

> "How long would we be airborne?"

> "Approximately ninety minutes. Sufficient time to demonstrate the primary capabilities without causing undue concern to your air traffic control."

Freitas lifted the suit from its storage straps. The material was unlike anything he had encountered - lighter than his standard flight suit but with an integrated quality that suggested advanced manufacturing. The helmet was similarly alien, with a visor that seemed to be made of a single piece of transparent material.

> "Lieutenant," came HARBINGER's voice as he examined the equipment, "I should mention that this flight will expose you to capabilities that are classified at levels beyond your current clearance. Once you have experienced what these aircraft can accomplish, you will be bound by the same discretion requirements that govern Portugal's evaluation of our offer."

The warning gave Freitas pause. He was being invited to cross a line from which there might be no return - to become part of the secret that Portugal was wrestling with at the highest levels of government.

But the opportunity to fly the most advanced aircraft ever built proved irresistible.

> "I understand," he said, tucking the flight suit under his arm. "Give me fifteen minutes to get suited up and file a flight plan."

> "Excellent. I look forward to showing you what your Air Force could become."

Freitas walked quickly toward the crew facilities, his mind racing with anticipation and apprehension. In fifteen minutes, he would either experience the flight of his career or make the worst decision of his life.

Possibly both.

As he changed into the alien flight suit - which fit him perfectly despite never having been measured - he composed a brief message to the base commander:

*"Participating in requested demonstration flight with HARBINGER aircraft to evaluate capabilities for Portuguese Air Force assessment. Estimated flight time ninety minutes. Standard safety protocols being observed."*

Technically accurate. Minimally informative. Exactly the kind of message that would keep him out of immediate trouble while preserving his career options.

As he sealed the helmet and felt its systems integrate seamlessly with his vision and hearing, Freitas realized he had just volunteered to become the first Portuguese pilot to fly with an artificial intelligence.

The thought should have terrified him.

Instead, it filled him with the same excitement he had felt the first time he had climbed into an F-16's cockpit.

---

### Monte Real Air Base, VIP Apron
### June 28, 2025 - 1650 hours

Freitas approached the lead Talon with deliberate steps, the alien flight suit feeling surprisingly natural despite its advanced materials. The aircraft's canopy stood open like an invitation, its interior systems beginning to glow with soft illumination as he approached.

> "The aircraft is responding to your presence, Lieutenant," HARBINGER explained as Freitas climbed into the cockpit. "The suit and helmet form an integrated system with the aircraft's controls. You will find the interface intuitive."

As Freitas settled into the pilot's seat, he felt the aircraft come alive around him. The displays flickered to life, showing flight information in formats that were familiar yet advanced. The joystick and throttle felt perfectly weighted, responsive to the lightest touch.

Freitas keyed his radio. "Tower, this is Lieutenant Freitas aboard HARBINGER One. Requesting clearance for evaluation flight, estimated duration ninety minutes."

After a brief pause, the tower responded: "HARBINGER One, cleared to taxi to Runway 05. Contact departure control when ready."

As the canopy sealed with a soft hiss, HARBINGER's voice came through the helmet's integrated communication system.

> "Before we begin, Lieutenant, you should understand the capabilities of the equipment you are wearing. The suit provides environmental protection - limited resistance to temperature extremes, brief vacuum exposure, and even small arms fire, though I strongly advise against testing the latter as the experience remains quite painful."

Freitas felt a chill at the casual mention of vacuum exposure. What kind of demonstration was HARBINGER planning?

> "The aircraft is now taxiing," HARBINGER continued as the Talon began moving with mechanical precision toward the runway. "You will notice that I maintain standard protocols for air traffic control compatibility. Integration with existing systems is essential for operational effectiveness."

The taxi to the runway felt surreal - sitting in the pilot's seat of the most advanced aircraft ever built while an artificial intelligence handled all the controls. Yet somehow, Freitas felt more connected to the aircraft than he ever had in a conventional fighter.

> "Monte Real Tower, HARBINGER One ready for departure."

> "HARBINGER One, cleared for takeoff, Runway 05. Contact departure control passing three thousand feet."

Freitas felt the aircraft's engines spool up - not the familiar roar of turbofans, but a deeper, more resonant power that seemed to vibrate through the airframe itself. The acceleration was smooth but relentless, pressing him back into the seat as the Talon lifted off with an authority no F-16 could match.

> "Ninety minutes, Lieutenant," HARBINGER said as the Portuguese countryside fell away below them. "Let me show you what your Air Force could become."

---

### Monte Real Air Base, VIP Apron
### June 28, 2025 - 1823 hours

The Talon settled onto the runway with the same impossible smoothness it had displayed throughout the flight, touching down exactly ninety-three minutes after departure. As the aircraft taxied back to the VIP apron, the control tower watched in silence - they had tracked the departure but lost all contact after the aircraft had climbed beyond their radar coverage.

When the canopy opened, Lieutenant Miguel Freitas remained motionless in the pilot's seat for several long moments, staring straight ahead with an expression of stunned disbelief. Ground crew members approached cautiously as he finally moved to unbuckle his harness with hands that weren't quite steady.

Sergeant Major Silva reached the aircraft first. "Lieutenant? Are you alright, sir?"

Freitas climbed down from the cockpit without responding, his movements mechanical and distant. He pulled off the alien helmet and flight suit with deliberate care, as if handling artifacts from another civilization.

> "Sir?" Silva pressed. "How was the flight?"

Freitas looked at him with eyes that had seen too much. "I need to write a report," he said quietly, his voice carrying a weight that hadn't been there before the flight.

Corporal Cardoso approached from the other side. "Lieutenant, the base commander wants a briefing on the demonstration. He's been waiting in ops..."

> "Not now," Freitas cut him off, walking past the gathering ground crew toward the crew facilities. "I need to... I need to process what I saw. Give me time to write it down properly."

Several pilots who had been waiting near the flight line tried to intercept him, hungry for details about the flight. Freitas brushed past them with barely a nod, his usual collegiality replaced by the distant focus of a man trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.

> "Miguel!" called Captain Santos from the squadron operations building. "What was it like? What did HARBINGER show you?"

Freitas paused at the entrance to the crew quarters, turning back with an expression that silenced further questions.

> "Everything," he said simply. "It showed me everything."

He disappeared into the building, leaving behind a group of confused and increasingly worried colleagues. Twenty minutes later, they heard the decisive click of his quarters' door lock engaging.

Inside, Freitas sat at his small desk, staring at a blank report form. His hands trembled slightly as he started typing, trying to find words for experiences that defied conventional description.

How do you explain to your superiors that everything they thought they knew about air combat had just become obsolete?

Freitas began to write, knowing that his words would either change Portuguese military policy forever or end his career. Possibly both.

But someone had to document what HARBINGER's aircraft could really do.

Even if no one would believe it.

## Chapter 5: Assessment

### Palácio de São Bento, Lisbon
### July 1, 2025 - 0900 hours

General Cartaxo Alves walked through the familiar corridors of Portugal's seat of government with measured steps, but beneath his composed exterior, he carried the weight of perhaps the most consequential military briefing in the nation's history. The leather portfolio under his arm contained Lieutenant Freitas's report - seventeen pages of operational observations that challenged everything they thought they understood about the limits of flight.

The Cabinet room was already assembled when he arrived. Prime Minister Silva sat at the head of the polished table, flanked by Defense Minister Carvalho and the same collection of senior ministers who had been wrestling with HARBINGER's offer for the past three weeks. The atmosphere was expectant but tense - everyone understood they were about to hear details that would influence one of the most important decisions in Portuguese military history.

> "General Alves," Prime Minister Silva said, nodding toward the chair reserved for him. "Thank you for joining us. Minister Carvalho has briefed us on the political and strategic implications of HARBINGER's proposal. Now we need to understand what these aircraft can actually do."

Alves took his seat and opened the portfolio, extracting copies of Freitas's report for distribution around the table. The document's classification markings were unprecedented - *COSMIC TOP SECRET* with additional compartmentalized access restrictions that limited readership to fewer than a dozen people in the entire Portuguese government.

> "Prime Minister, ministers," Alves began, his voice carrying the gravity of the moment, "what I'm about to share with you represents operational observations that challenge our understanding of what constitutes aircraft capability. Lieutenant Freitas spent ninety-three minutes aboard a Talon-class fighter under HARBINGER's direct control. His report is... uncharacteristically brief on technical details, but extraordinarily detailed on what he experienced as a pilot."

Foreign Minister Ribeiro leaned forward, adjusting his glasses. "General, before we proceed - how certain are we about the accuracy of these observations? Could Lieutenant Freitas have been... deceived somehow?"

Alves had anticipated the question. "Minister, Freitas makes no claims about how the aircraft functions. He simply reports what he observed and felt as an experienced pilot. His descriptions are remarkably clinical for experiences that appear to have profoundly shaken him."

Defense Minister Carvalho gestured toward the reports. "What were the key observations, General?"

Alves opened his copy to the first operational section. "The demonstration began with atmospheric flight performance that exceeded anything in Freitas's experience. He reports sustained high-speed flight with maneuvering characteristics that made his F-16 training feel primitive by comparison. HARBINGER executed flight profiles that would have destroyed conventional aircraft, apparently without stress on either the airframe or the pilot."

Prime Minister Silva studied the sparse technical annotations in the report. "Freitas provides no analysis of how this was accomplished?"

> "None," Alves confirmed. "He states explicitly that HARBINGER provided no technical explanations, and that most of the aircraft's systems appeared automated. From his perspective as a pilot, the aircraft simply performed beyond the boundaries of conventional physics."

Alves turned to the next section, his expression growing more serious.

> "Then HARBINGER demonstrated what it called 'multi-domain capability.' The aircraft descended to sea level and... entered the Atlantic Ocean."

The silence around the table was immediate and profound. Finance Minister Santos was the first to speak.

> "The aircraft went underwater?"

> "To a depth of approximately five hundred meters," Alves confirmed. "Freitas reports that the aircraft sealed itself completely and operated beneath the surface for twenty-seven minutes. He describes the experience as 'flying underwater' - the same control responsiveness, the same maneuvering capability, as if the change from air to water was irrelevant to the aircraft's operation."

Interior Minister Pereira shook his head slowly. "General, aircraft don't function underwater. The physics alone..."

> "Freitas makes no attempt to explain the physics," Alves replied. "He simply reports his observations. According to his account, visibility through the water was somehow enhanced, allowing him to observe marine life and underwater terrain with clarity that shouldn't have been possible."

Alves turned to the next section, marked with additional security warnings.

> "The demonstration then proceeded to what HARBINGER termed 'orbital capability.' The aircraft ascended vertically from underwater directly into space."

European Affairs Minister Costa felt her breath catch. "Space? You mean..."

> "Freitas reports reaching what appeared to be orbital altitude in approximately ninety seconds," Alves said quietly. "He describes looking down at Earth's curvature, observing weather patterns from above, seeing the familiar outline of Iberia from space. His flight suit apparently provided complete life support throughout the experience."

Justice Minister Moreira raised the obvious question. "How is this possible? Aircraft engines don't function in vacuum..."

> "Again, Freitas provides no technical analysis. He simply states that the transition from atmosphere to vacuum was seamless, with no apparent change in the aircraft's operation. From his perspective, it was as if the aircraft was equally comfortable in any environment."

Alves paused, weighing his next words carefully before continuing to the most extraordinary section of the report.

> "But the orbital demonstration was merely preparation for what HARBINGER called 'interplanetary capability.' According to Freitas's account, the aircraft then traveled to Jupiter."

The Cabinet room erupted in shocked voices before Prime Minister Silva raised his hand for silence.

> "Jupiter? The planet Jupiter?"

> "Freitas reports a journey time of approximately twenty-five seconds," Alves said, his voice barely above a whisper. "He describes observing the gas giant's Great Red Spot, its major moons, the radiation patterns around the planet. He provides sketches of what he observed that match published astronomical data."

Defense Minister Carvalho leaned back in her chair, struggling to process the implications. "General, you're describing travel between planets in seconds. That's... that's impossible."

> "Freitas acknowledges that his observations challenge conventional understanding," Alves replied. "But he also states that he felt no acceleration, no g-forces, no physical stress during the journey. From his perspective as a pilot, it was as if distance had simply become irrelevant."

Alves turned to another section of the report. "During the return journey, HARBINGER provided what Freitas describes as a 'tactical briefing' on the aircraft's combat systems. The Talon is equipped with a plasma-based autocannon as its primary weapon, along with varied missile payloads including area suppression warheads - Freitas specifically mentions something called 'Inferno' that matches reports from the Taiwan Strait incident."

Justice Minister Moreira leaned forward. "What other weapons systems?"

> "Air-to-air and air-to-ground attack missiles, plus anti-ship and anti-installation warheads," Alves continued. "But perhaps most significantly, the aircraft is equipped with what HARBINGER termed a 'shield generator' that renders it practically invulnerable to contemporary air defense systems and interceptors. According to Freitas's account, only massive numerical superiority could potentially overwhelm these defenses."

Foreign Minister Ribeiro voiced what they were all thinking. "If this is accurate, we're not talking about advanced aircraft. We're talking about technology that makes conventional military power obsolete."

Alves nodded grimly. "Freitas concludes his report with a simple observation: 'Any nation possessing this technology would be militarily untouchable. Any nation opposing it would be defenseless.' He makes no recommendations, provides no technical assessments. He simply reports what he experienced."

Prime Minister Silva felt the weight of an impossible decision settling on his shoulders. "General, in your assessment, is Lieutenant Freitas a reliable witness?"

> "He's one of our most experienced pilots," Alves replied. "Conservative, methodical, not given to flights of imagination. The fact that he provides no speculation, no theories, only direct observations, actually increases the credibility of his account."

Interior Minister Pereira voiced the concern they were all wrestling with. "General, if these observations are accurate, then HARBINGER isn't offering us advanced aircraft. It's offering us access to technology that appears to be... alien."

Alves consulted the final section of Freitas's report. "His psychological assessment addresses this concern. He states that throughout the demonstration, HARBINGER communicated with him constantly, explaining each phase of the flight in terms he could understand. He reports no sense of menace or deception, only what he describes as 'patient instruction from a superior intelligence.'"

> "But he also notes that this same intelligence demonstrated capabilities that could end human civilization if deployed hostilely. The question isn't whether we trust HARBINGER's benevolence - it's whether we believe we have any choice in the matter."

Prime Minister Silva looked around the table at his ministers, each face reflecting the same mixture of awe and terror he felt. Portugal hadn't been offered a military upgrade - they had been offered a glimpse into a future where conventional concepts of power, distance, and defense had become meaningless.

> "General, in your professional military judgment, what should Portugal's response be?"

Alves had been dreading this question while simultaneously knowing it was inevitable. His response would carry enormous weight in the government's final decision.

> "Prime Minister, from a conventional military perspective, the question is meaningless. We're not evaluating aircraft or weapons systems - we're being invited to participate in a paradigm that transcends current military thinking entirely."

He paused, choosing his words with extreme care.

> "But Freitas's final observation may be the most important. He notes that HARBINGER chose to demonstrate these capabilities to Portugal, chose to make this offer to our nation specifically. The question isn't whether we accept or decline - it's whether we recognize that we've already been selected."

Alves closed the report and looked directly at the Prime Minister.

> "Sir, Lieutenant Freitas traveled to Jupiter and back in ninety minutes. He experienced capabilities that make every military force on Earth equally obsolete. The choice before us isn't between aircraft procurement options - it's between irrelevance and participation in whatever comes next."

The Cabinet room fell silent as the weight of the assessment settled over the assembled ministers. Portugal hadn't been offered a place among conventional military powers - they had been offered a seat at a table where the rules of power itself were being rewritten.

The decision that would define not just the nation's military future, but its place in a universe suddenly revealed to be far larger and more complex than anyone had imagined, was now in their hands.

And HARBINGER was waiting for their answer.

### Palácio de São Bento, Lisbon - Secure Conference Room
### July 1, 2025 - 1430 hours

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas had never felt smaller than he did sitting at the polished table facing the most powerful people in Portugal. The secure conference room deep within the parliament building had no windows, no distractions - just the weight of absolute attention focused on him from across the table.

Prime Minister Silva sat at the center, flanked by his senior ministers. General Alves occupied the chair beside Freitas, a gesture of support that the lieutenant appreciated more than he could express. The atmosphere was expectant, almost desperate - these were people grappling with decisions that would echo through history, and they needed to understand exactly what they were choosing between.

> "Lieutenant Freitas," Prime Minister Silva began, his voice carrying the gravity of the moment, "we've read your report. But we need to hear directly from you about your experience aboard the Talon. What you felt, what you saw, what convinced you that what you observed was real."

Freitas shifted in his chair, acutely aware that his words would influence Portugal's future. "Prime Minister, ministers, I want to be clear from the start - I'm a pilot, not a scientist. I can't explain how the Talon works, only what I experienced during those ninety-three minutes."

Defense Minister Carvalho leaned forward. "Lieutenant, your report mentions three events that particularly impressed you. Could you walk us through them?"

Freitas nodded, gathering his thoughts. "The first was when we entered the ocean. I've flown over water thousands of times, but I've never been *in* it. HARBINGER brought the aircraft down to sea level, and then... we just kept descending."

He paused, trying to find words for an experience that still felt surreal.

> "The transition was seamless. One moment we were flying through air, the next we were flying through water. The aircraft sealed itself completely - I could feel the change in pressure, hear the systems adjusting. But from a pilot's perspective, the controls responded exactly the same way. Stick input for pitch, rudder for yaw. It was like flying an F-16 underwater, which should be impossible."

Finance Minister Santos interrupted. "But you're certain you were actually underwater? Not in some kind of simulation?"

> "Sir, I could see marine life through the canopy. Schools of fish, underwater terrain, rock formations on the seafloor. We descended to approximately five hundred meters - I could feel the pressure change in my ears despite the life support systems. And HARBINGER explained that we were demonstrating the aircraft's ability to hunt submarines or conduct underwater reconnaissance missions."

Interior Minister Pereira shook his head slowly. "Lieutenant, aircraft engines don't function underwater. The physics..."

> "I understand that, sir. But I'm reporting what I experienced, not what should be possible. The Talon operated underwater for twenty-seven minutes exactly as it operated in atmosphere. Whatever propulsion system it uses, water doesn't seem to affect it."

European Affairs Minister Costa spoke next. "Your report mentions a transition to space. Could you describe that experience?"

Freitas felt his jaw tighten at the memory. "That was... intense. After the underwater demonstration, HARBINGER announced we would be ascending to orbital altitude. I expected a gradual climb, like what you'd see with a rocket launch. Instead, the Talon went vertical and accelerated harder than anything I've ever experienced."

He paused, touching his chest unconsciously.

> "The G-forces were incredible. I've been through high-G training, experienced eight Gs in aerobatic maneuvers, but this was different. The acceleration kept building until I started to black out. My vision tunneled, I could barely breathe, and then suddenly we were in space."

Justice Minister Moreira leaned forward with concern. "You lost consciousness?"

> "Briefly, sir. Maybe ten or fifteen seconds. When my vision cleared, I was looking down at Earth's curvature. I could see the Iberian Peninsula below us, cloud formations over the Atlantic, the terminator line where day met night. We were in orbit."

Foreign Minister Ribeiro studied Freitas intently. "And you're certain this wasn't some kind of high-altitude flight? Modern aircraft can reach extreme altitudes..."

> "Sir, I've seen satellite imagery, but seeing Earth from space with your own eyes is unmistakable. The curvature, the thin line of atmosphere, the complete blackness above. We were definitely in space. And again, the transition from air-breathing to vacuum operation was seamless for the aircraft."

Prime Minister Silva had been quiet throughout this exchange, but now he spoke with careful precision. "Lieutenant, your report mentions a journey to Jupiter. That's the claim that stretches credibility the most. Help us understand what you experienced."

Freitas took a deep breath. This was the part he knew would sound impossible, even to himself.

> "From orbit, HARBINGER announced we would be demonstrating interplanetary capability. I thought it was some kind of metaphor, maybe a high-speed trajectory around Earth. Then the Talon's interior lighting changed - everything took on this blue-white glow - and HARBINGER told me to observe what it called 'warp translation.'"

He closed his eyes, remembering.

> "Space ahead of us began to... change. It wasn't like conventional acceleration. Instead, everything outside the canopy became this luminous tunnel of light. Blues, whites, colors I don't have names for. It was like flying through a tube made of stars and light. Beautiful and terrifying at the same time."

Defense Minister Carvalho was taking notes rapidly. "How long did this 'tunnel effect' last?"

> "Approximately twenty-five seconds. And then we were... elsewhere. The tunnel collapsed back to normal space, and I was looking at Jupiter. Not a distant point of light, but the actual planet filling most of my field of view. The Great Red Spot, the cloud bands, four of its moons clearly visible. I could even see what HARBINGER described as radiation patterns around the planet."

The silence in the room was profound. Finance Minister Santos finally spoke.

> "Lieutenant, you're describing faster-than-light travel. Do you understand what you're claiming?"

> "Sir, I'm not claiming anything about the physics. I'm simply reporting what I observed. We were at Jupiter for perhaps five minutes - HARBINGER provided what it called an 'astronomical briefing' about the planet's composition and moons. Then we returned through the same luminous tunnel effect, and twenty-five seconds later we were back in Earth orbit."

Interior Minister Pereira leaned back in his chair, struggling with the implications. "And during this entire experience, you felt no skepticism? No doubt about what you were seeing?"

Freitas considered the question carefully. "Sir, my training as a pilot teaches you to trust your instruments and your observations, even when they don't match your expectations. Throughout the flight, HARBINGER was constantly communicating with me, explaining what we were doing and why. It never felt deceptive or illusory. It felt like the most advanced flight training I'd ever received."

Prime Minister Silva studied the lieutenant for a long moment. "In your professional judgment as a pilot, was any of what you experienced achievable with known human technology?"

> "No sir. Not even close. The underwater capability alone defies everything I know about aircraft design. The space transition, the interplanetary travel... we're talking about technology that's decades, maybe centuries ahead of anything currently possible."

General Alves spoke for the first time during the session. "Lieutenant, one final question. Based on your experience, what's your assessment of HARBINGER's intentions toward Portugal?"

Freitas paused, weighing his words carefully.

> "Sir, throughout the entire flight, HARBINGER treated me with what I can only describe as patient instruction. It explained everything it was doing, answered my questions, demonstrated capabilities without showing off or intimidating. If it wanted to threaten Portugal, it wouldn't need to be subtle about it. These aircraft could level Lisbon in minutes if that was the goal."

He looked around the table at the assembled ministers.

> "But instead, it's offering us a partnership. Twenty-five aircraft that would make Portugal's air force more capable than most nations' entire militaries. The question isn't whether we can trust HARBINGER - it's whether we can afford not to accept what it's offering."

The secure conference room fell silent as the weight of Freitas's testimony settled over the assembled leadership. They had heard from their most experienced pilot that everything in his report was not just possible, but had actually happened.

Portugal was being offered a seat at a table where the fundamental nature of military power, of physics itself, had been redefined.

The only question remaining was whether they had the courage to accept it.
