## Chapter 1: The Cancellation

### Lisbon, Portugal - Air Force Headquarters
### March 14, 2025 - 1400 hours

The press conference room at Portuguese Air Force headquarters had seen its share of routine announcements over the years, but nothing quite like this. General Cartaxo Alves stood behind the podium, his weathered hands steady on the lectern despite the magnitude of what he was about to announce. Behind him, the blue and white Portuguese Air Force crest seemed to watch over the assembled journalists with silent authority.

The room was packed. Word had leaked that morning that something significant was coming - the kind of leak that happens when you need the press to show up but can't tell them why. Representatives from *PÃºblico*, *Expresso*, and the major television networks sat in the front rows. International defense correspondents occupied the middle seats, their recorders and cameras ready.

Alves cleared his throat, the sound sharp in the expectant silence.

> "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming on short notice. I have an important announcement regarding the Portuguese Air Force's modernization program."

He paused, letting the gravity settle in the room.

> "Effective immediately, Portugal is suspending all activities related to the F-35 Lightning II procurement program. Our participation in the trial phase has been terminated, and we are withdrawing from the multinational purchase agreement signed last year."

The room erupted. Cameras flashed, voices called out questions, but Alves raised a hand for silence.

> "This decision reflects operational and security concerns that have emerged during our evaluation period. While the F-35 remains a capable aircraft, we have determined that our national defense requirements would be better served by alternative solutions."

A journalist from *Lusa* news agency raised her hand. "General, can you elaborate on these security concerns? Are they related to the aircraft's technology or operational capability?"

Alves chose his words carefully. "Portugal remains committed to NATO and our collective defense obligations. However, we must ensure our national security remains resilient *under all circumstances*. We will evaluate all available alternatives to modernize our Air Force."

The emphasis on "under all circumstances" was subtle but clear to those who understood the current political climate. President Trump's recent statements about NATO burden-sharing had sent ripples throughout European defense circles.

> "The Portuguese government has full confidence in our current F-16 fleet and our ability to maintain air sovereignty while we explore other options. We are in contact with several alternative suppliers, including our European partners."

Another hand shot up from the back. "General, is this related to President Trump's comments about NATO commitment levels?"

The question everyone wanted to ask had been voiced. Alves maintained his diplomatic composure.

> "Portugal's defense policy is determined by Portuguese interests and our commitment to our allies. We believe diversity in our defense procurement strengthens both our national capabilities and our alliance relationships. This decision reflects that principle."

It was a masterful non-answer that said everything without saying anything at all.

> "The suspension is effective immediately. All Portuguese personnel currently training on F-35 systems will return to Portugal within thirty days. We will be announcing our alternative procurement strategy in the coming weeks."

As the questions continued, Alves fielded them with the practiced ease of a career military officer who understood both the technical and political dimensions of what he was announcing. But beneath his calm exterior, he knew this was just the beginning. The decision to walk away from the F-35 program wasn't just about aircraft procurement - it was about hedging against an uncertain future where traditional alliances might not be as reliable as they once seemed.

The press conference concluded after forty minutes, leaving the assembled journalists with enough material for headlines but enough ambiguity to fuel speculation for weeks to come. As Alves walked back to his office, his aide fell into step beside him.

> "Sir, the Ministry wants a full briefing by 1800 hours. And there's already chatter from Brussels about scheduling a meeting."

Alves nodded, unsurprised. "Schedule it. And make sure Lieutenant Freitas is available for the technical briefing. I want him to walk through exactly what we observed during the evaluation period."

The aide made a note. "And the Eurofighter consortium?"

> "They can wait their turn. Let's see who else calls first."

As they entered the elevator, Alves allowed himself a moment of quiet satisfaction. Portugal had just taken a small but significant step toward strategic independence. Whether it would prove wise remained to be seen.

The elevator doors closed with a soft chime, carrying the general back to the business of running an air force in an increasingly complicated world.
