## The Arrival

### Vireen's Observations

The **Grand Concordance of Interstellar Medicine** was in full swing. The **Xenari**, **Seraphyn**, **Kryllians**, and dozens of other species moved in polite currents through the expansive **Ivai’Shan Medical Complex**, an orbital research station suspended over the Xenari homeworld. 

Vireen **Taa’Sho-Vel**, a young Xenari researcher, stood amidst the shifting tides of brilliant minds, her bioluminescent markings dim with polite focus. She was one of the youngest **neurophysiology specialists** present, her research into cross-species neurochemical interactions still in its early stages. This conference was her first real exposure to the **diverse biological paradigms** of the greater galaxy. 

She had already noted fascinating contrasts in the attendees. The **Seraphyn**, with their **resonant cognition**, operated on an entirely different level of communication. The **Kryllians**, ever pragmatic, dominated discussions of cybernetic augmentation. The **Ryzak**, notably absent from the official delegations, were often subjects of whispered speculation regarding **genetic aggression enhancements**.

But what intrigued Vireen most were the **humans**.

There were only a handful of them in attendance—a rarity in such settings. Their homeworld was still isolated, their presence in galactic affairs restricted to the shadows of their **EarthSpace Federation**. Vireen had spent the last two days listening to their presentations, poring over their clinical methodologies, and marveling at their **peculiar physiology**. Their **nervous systems operated with alarming efficiency**, and their **biochemistry showed an uncanny resilience**—anomalies that piqued her scientific curiosity. 

Most intriguing was the **presence of a Terran Marine** among them. **Staff Sergeant Logan Carter** was an anomaly amid the sea of researchers. His military posture, his **scarred hands**, and his **calm, assessing gaze** spoke of a life in violence. But he wasn’t alone. 

- **Dr. Evelyn Park** – a trauma surgeon whose hands moved in **precise, calculated motions**, her quiet intelligence measuring every conversation.
- **Dr. Marcus Patel** – a biologist specializing in **metabolic resilience**, whose affable demeanor masked the keen mind beneath.
- **Dr. Alan Greaves** – a geneticist whose work on **adaptive stress responses** fascinated her.
- **Dr. Rebecca Henshaw** – an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist.

A combatant among healers. It was a contradiction she found **endlessly fascinating**. 

Then everything changed.

### The Terror Squad Strikes

It began with a **series of sharp cracks**—the unmistakable sound of **ballistic discharges** against reinforced glass. The hum of conversation **shattered into silence**, the crowd **freezing** in a moment of collective confusion before the first **detonations** shook the hall.

The **conference hall’s shielding flickered**, failing under what Vireen instantly recognized as **disruptor-based breaching charges**. **Arcs of emerald plasma** slashed through the luminous air as figures **cloaked in dark armor** stormed through the breaches. 

Vireen’s bioluminescence **dimmed to a dull, terrified glow**.

The attackers were **not Ryzak**—not entirely. Their **bio-engineered physiques** were bulkier than the average humanoid, their **thick hides** lined with **chitinous plating**, their **eyes slitted** in predatory focus. Augmented mercenaries, most likely, but they bore **Ryzak insignias**—loyalists or hired guns, it did not matter. 

They moved with brutal efficiency, **corralling the delegates** into a central mass. Scientists and physicians **collapsed to their knees**, some **whimpering in confusion**, others simply **too overwhelmed** to react. 

A Kryllian researcher attempted to **barter for his life**, his voice a rapid cascade of negotiation—only to be **silenced by a savage strike** from the **back of a gauntleted fist**. His **small, stocky frame crumpled**, ammonia-rich blood **spattering** the polished floor.

Vireen **felt her breath hitch** in sheer horror.

The **lead terrorist**, an imposing figure with **four muscled arms**, stepped forward. His **serrated mandibles clicked** as he surveyed the frozen researchers. 

“**Your collaboration with the Xenari makes you enemies of the true order.**” His voice **boomed**, thick with the guttural cadence of a warrior species. “**You will submit, or you will be made examples.**”

Several **Seraphyn**, their natural **telepathic aura humming with distress**, attempted to speak—only for the mercenaries to **slam them to the ground**, forcing their elongated limbs into unnatural angles.

The **hall pulsed with rising panic**.

Vireen **couldn’t move**. Couldn’t breathe. The ingrained Xenari **instinct to analyze, to calculate** battled against the **primal truth of immediate danger**. 

She was **not alone** in her paralysis. 

None of the aliens fought back. 

None of them could.

For all their advancements, for all their **intellect**, the assembled species of the galaxy **the one thing** that humanity possessed.

### The Hostage Declaration

“**This station is now under our control,**” the leader declared. **Clawed fingers gestured** toward the terrified crowd. “**Any resistance will be met with annihilation. Any attempt to summon aid will bring only death. Cooperate, and you may yet live.**” 

His slitted eyes **raked over the gathered scientists**, lingering on the **human contingent**. There was **no immediate reaction** from the Terrans. 

Vireen’s vision **blurred with panic** as she turned toward them.

They were **not frozen**.

They were **waiting**.

Something **shifted** in their stance.

The **marine’s breathing slowed**. The **doctors exchanged glances**—a flicker of unspoken communication passing between them.

Something was about to **change**.

Something the aliens present **had never seen before**.

And when it happened, **the galaxy would never forget it**.

## Adrenaline (Part II)  
### Unleashing the Beast  

The room held its breath.  

Every alien researcher was frozen in terror. Even the Kryllians, typically so pragmatic, stood paralyzed in disbelief. The Seraphyn shuddered, their telepathic sensitivity overwhelmed by the sheer *wrongness* of the moment. No one moved.  

No one except the **humans**.  

Something changed in them. The way they held themselves, the way their eyes sharpened, their muscles tensed. Their breathing slowed—not in fear, but in **focus**.  

The terrorists had made one fatal mistake:  

They assumed the humans were like every other species in the galaxy.  

They assumed **wrong**.  

#### Logan Carter: The Opening Kill  

Staff Sergeant Logan Carter moved first.  

One moment, he was standing in place, hands raised in false surrender. The next, he **exploded** forward like a missile, his **brutal speed** defying the weight of his frame.  

The four-armed terrorist leader barely had time to react before Carter **grabbed his rifle barrel**, wrenched it aside, and drove a knee into the alien’s gut with *crushing* force. A sickening *crack* filled the air—**something inside snapped**—but Carter didn’t stop.  

**He spun.**  

A second terrorist, reaching for his weapon, was met with a **full-force elbow strike to the temple**. His **exoskeletal plates** cracked like brittle ceramic. **Before the body hit the ground, Carter was already moving**—he ripped the rifle from the leader’s grip and, in a single motion, **drove the stock straight through the terrorist’s throat**.  

Chitin and muscle gave way like wet paper.  

The leader **collapsed**, clutching at the gaping ruin where his airway had been.  

Logan Carter didn’t even glance at the **dying, wheezing pile of twitching limbs** at his feet.  

Because the others were already in motion.  

#### Dr. Evelyn Park: A Surgeon’s Precision  

Dr. Evelyn Park **was not a fighter.**  

But she was a trauma surgeon.  

Which meant she knew **exactly where to cut.**  

One of the terrorists lunged for her with a **jagged plasma dagger**.  

She didn’t retreat.  

She **sidestepped** and let his own momentum carry him past her.  

Then, she **slammed her palm into his elbow joint**—the limb **snapped backward with a sickening wet crunch**. His shriek of pain barely left his mandibles before she **grabbed a discarded surgical scalpel from the floor** and **plunged it into the gap between his neck plates.**  

She twisted.  

The blade severed **everything that mattered.**  

The **terrorist spasmed violently** as his spinal column was **severed**, and he collapsed in a heap.  

Evelyn **yanked the scalpel free**, **flicked the alien blood off with practiced precision**, and looked up for the next target.  

#### Dr. Marcus Patel: The Biologist Breaks Bone  

Dr. Marcus Patel had always been a **gentle man**. A scholar. A scientist.  

But biology had taught him one thing:  

**Pressure points are universal.**  

As a terrorist turned toward him, weapon raised, Patel **drove his fist into the alien’s throat**—not a punch, but a **surgical** strike, fingers extended.  

The **windpipe crushed instantly.**  

The terrorist staggered, choking. Patel **grabbed a metal chair**, swung it in a **wide arc**, and brought it **down onto the alien’s skull with a force that shattered bone.**  

The chair **dented inward** from the impact.  

The terrorist **collapsed**, limbs twitching in post-mortem spasms.  

Patel let out a breath.  

His knuckles were bleeding.  

He ignored it.  

#### Dr. Alan Greaves: The Geneticist’s Fury  

Dr. Alan Greaves didn’t think. He just **moved**.  

A terrorist swung at him with **razor-sharp claws**.  

Greaves **caught the arm**, twisted at the **wrist**, and **snapped it at the elbow** with a sharp, brutal jerk.  

The alien howled in agony.  

Greaves didn’t let go.  

He **yanked the terrorist forward** and **smashed his forehead into the alien’s face**—**once, twice, three times**—until **his own face was splattered with alien ichor.**  

The terrorist’s skull **caved in.**  

Greaves let him drop like garbage.  

His **vision swam with adrenaline**, but he **felt no pain**.  

He looked for his next kill.  

#### Dr. Rebecca Henshaw: The Epidemiologist’s Execution  

Dr. Rebecca Henshaw **was calm**.  

Too calm.  

The last remaining terrorist **charged at her**, combat knife raised—  

She **sidestepped with clinical precision** and **grabbed his wrist**.  

She pressed her **thumb into the soft tissue between his carpal plates**—the pressure point **ignited** his nerves.  

He *screamed*.  

Then she **twisted his arm backward**—not breaking it, but **forcing the knife toward his own gut**.  

He struggled. She held firm.  

The **blade sank into his own abdomen.**  

Then, with a single, smooth motion, she **ripped the knife upward**, **gutting him from stomach to sternum**.  

He **fell in two halves.**  

---

### The Aftermath  

The silence was deafening.  

The **floor was slick with alien blood.**  

The **air stank of burned flesh and raw iron.**  

Vireen **Taa’Sho-Vel** could barely comprehend what she had just **witnessed**.  

One moment, the humans had been still, measured.  

The next, they had **become something else entirely**.  

The **other alien delegates remained frozen**, some trembling, some wide-eyed in sheer disbelief.  

The **terrorists were gone.**  

Every single one had been **ripped apart**.  

And the **humans stood in the aftermath**, panting, bodies **bruised and bleeding**—but **alive**.  

Vireen saw **Carter wipe a hand across his blood-smeared face** and glance at the others.  

“…Everybody good?”  

Dr. Park checked her **own bleeding arm** and nodded.  

“**Fine.**”  

Dr. Patel spat **alien blood from his mouth.**  

“**I’ve had worse.**”  

Greaves stretched his **bruised knuckles** and let out a slow exhale.  

“**I need a drink.**”  

Henshaw **shook off her bloodied hands** like she had just finished **washing up in a sink.**  

# Aftermath

The fight was over.  

The bodies of the terrorists lay scattered across the **blood-slicked conference floor**, their forms **twisted and broken** in ways that defied natural anatomy. The acrid stench of **burnt chitin and spilled alien ichor** hung in the air, mixing with the coppery tang of **human blood**.  

The humans stood amidst the carnage, **panting, bruised, and bleeding**.  

And then, **the adrenaline wore off**.  

### The Pain Sets In  

Logan Carter was the first to feel it.  

His **ribs ached like hell**, and when he took a breath, it was **sharp and ragged**—definitely **cracked, maybe broken**. His **left arm felt numb**, which wasn’t great considering it had been **holding up a terrorist’s skull not long ago**. His **knuckles throbbed**, split open from **bone-on-bone** impacts, and now that he wasn’t mid-murder, he **really** felt the deep, gnawing pain in his **thigh**—where one of those bastard aliens had **sunk a claw in deep**.  

He glanced down. **Yup. Still bleeding.**  

Well.  

“**Shit, guys, that was fun. Who’s up for round two?**”  

Dr. Evelyn Park **shot him a glare** as she **clutched her wounded arm**, using her medical coat as a makeshift bandage. “**Carter, if you don’t shut up, I will personally anesthetize you with my fist.**”  

Carter smirked, despite himself. “**Oof, doc, at least buy me a drink first.**”  

### Alien Doctors, Stunned into Action  

The **alien medical teams** finally snapped out of their collective stupor. The Xenari, Seraphyn, and Kryllian physicians, **once paralyzed by disbelief**, now **rushed forward** with medkits and scanners.  

Vireen **Taa’Sho-Vel** led the charge.  

Her **bioluminescent markings pulsed erratically**, the Xenari equivalent of **complete and utter bewilderment**. She had **never** seen anything like this.  

The humans should have been **dead**.  

By all biological reasoning, they **should not have been standing**, let alone **cracking jokes** as they dripped blood onto the floor.  

“**You require immediate medical intervention,**” she declared, her voice **warbling in disbelief** as she tried to process **what she had just witnessed**.  

“**Yeah, yeah, we know.**” Carter waved dismissively, then winced when **the motion sent a jolt of agony up his side**. “**Ow. Okay, yeah, fine. Let’s go, Doc Lizard.**”  

Vireen **chose to ignore the nickname.**  

A Kryllian medic, **his squat form bustling with urgency**, moved to **support Dr. Marcus Patel**, who was **limping**—his knee **swollen and dark with internal bleeding** from when he had **used it to snap a terrorist’s skull open**.  

“**By the Founders, how are you still mobile?!**” the Kryllian blurted.  

Patel **gritted his teeth**. “**Pain is just information. I’ll process it later.**”  

The Kryllian **gawked at him** like he had just spoken **in tongues**.  

Dr. Rebecca Henshaw, **still eerily calm**, glanced at the nearest Xenari medic. “**I assume your emergency care is sterilized for cross-species infection control?**”  

The medic **nodded rapidly**, still looking shell-shocked.  

“**Good. Then do whatever you need to. Just don’t drug me too hard, I want to stay awake.**”  

Vireen **hurried forward**. “**You need pain management—**”  

Henshaw **stared** at her.  

Not aggressively. Not threateningly. Just **flatly**, like she was **staring through her soul**.  

“…Fine. I will keep it minimal,” Vireen relented.  

Henshaw **gave her a nod**.  

### Emergency Care, and More Questions  

The med teams rushed them down the corridor into the **primary trauma bay**, a sleek Xenari-designed facility that gleamed with **advanced biotech** and **zero-contamination measures**.  

Staff were **whispering in hushed tones**—not just about the attack, but about **the humans**.  

Vireen **caught snippets of murmured conversation**.  

> “They fought without weapons…”  
> “Did you see how fast they moved? How… violent?”  
> “They should not have been able to endure those injuries…”  
> “I thought they lacked an external stimulant system—how do they do this?”  

Vireen’s mind **raced**.  

This wasn’t just **combat experience**.  

This wasn’t just **training**.  

This was **something else entirely.**  

Something **biological**.  

As the medical teams got to work, she **watched them closely**.  

Even **in pain, even wounded**, they were **different**.  

And she was **going to find out why**.  

## Aftermath (Part II)  
### Alien Medicine, Human Resilience  

The trauma bay of the **Ivai’Shan Medical Complex** was a gleaming cathedral of **pristine biotech and antiseptic sterility**. Rows of **suspension platforms** hovered above the floor, their occupants bathed in softly pulsing **diagnostic fields**.  

The humans lay **half-dressed and battered** beneath the light of **Xenari medical scanners**, their wounds being cleaned, scanned, and treated with an efficiency **only achievable through centuries of medical advancement**.  

And yet, despite the overwhelming expertise of the attending doctors, there was one universal truth in the air:  

**No one could comprehend what they were looking at.**  

### The Readings  

Vireen **Taa’Sho-Vel** stood among a cluster of physicians, her bioluminescent markings **flaring wildly** in confusion. She wasn’t alone—**Seraphyn, Kryllian, and Xenari doctors** huddled around the floating holoscreens, peering at the streams of data with **something bordering on disbelief**.  

“**This is… incorrect. It must be.**” One of the Seraphyn doctors, a tall, spectral-looking figure, **tilted their head** at the readings. Their **prismatic eyes** flickered through shifting light spectrums. “**Their nervous system should have collapsed. These levels of stress hormones are… catastrophic.**”  

A Kryllian surgeon, **his exoskeletal fingers twitching with analytical frustration**, **zoomed in on one of the metabolic readouts**. “**No species should be capable of remaining conscious with this degree of physical trauma, much less functioning coherently.**”  

The **holograms displayed an overwhelming cascade of anomalies**:  
- **Pain receptors blunted**, but not inactive.  
- **Blood clotting at enhanced speeds**, despite no artificial coagulants.  
- **Organ function sustained at peak levels, despite clear damage.**  
- **Endorphin levels spiking in ways that would induce cardiac arrest in other species.**  

“**I do not understand,**” Vireen whispered, **tracing a trembling finger** across the holographic data streams. “**They were using their own injuries to continue fighting. Their bodies… adapted.**”  

A ripple of unsettled **chittering and murmurs** passed through the assembled physicians.  

“**That is not possible.**” The Kryllian’s voice was tight, his disbelief nearly *offended*. “**Nothing survives with this level of metabolic instability.**”  

The Seraphyn doctor **sighed, rubbing the bridge of their nose**. “**And yet. Here they are. Breathing. Bleeding. Laughing.**”  

They **all turned** toward the treatment platforms.  

### Treatment and Perseverance  

Staff Sergeant Logan Carter, **propped up on one of the diagnostic tables**, was **grinning through the pain** as a Xenari medic used a **microsurgical tool** to **close the deep claw wound in his thigh**.  

The medic worked **with extreme care**, his elongated fingers **trembling slightly**. He had **never** treated a patient who had sustained such injuries **without screaming**.  

Carter, instead, was **watching the process with mild amusement**.  

“**Y’know, Doc, if you’re trying to get to third base, at least buy me dinner first.**”  

The Xenari medic **froze**. His large, obsidian eyes **blinked in confusion**. “**I… do not understand. What does this have to do with sport?**”  

Dr. Evelyn Park groaned from the next table over. “**Ignore him. He makes bad jokes when he’s concussed.**”  

The Xenari **visibly hesitated**, as if unsure whether Carter was actually suffering from **brain damage or just a chronic personality disorder**.  

Further down the line, Dr. Rebecca Henshaw **watched impassively** as a Seraphyn medic **gently applied a regenerative salve** to her bloodied hands.  

“**Your tolerance for pain is remarkable,**” the medic murmured, voice carrying a distant, ethereal quality. “**Would you like an analgesic block? We can suppress all nociceptive input.**”  

Henshaw didn’t even look up. “**No. Keep it minimal. I need my hands steady.**”  

The medic’s expression was **genuinely puzzled**. “**But… the pain must be excruciating.**”  

Henshaw’s **bloodshot eyes** flicked toward him. “**Then I’ll know I’m still alive.**”  

The Seraphyn, **for the first time in his career, did not know what to say.**  

Meanwhile, **Dr. Marcus Patel** lay on his own treatment platform, one arm **shielding his eyes** as he listened to the unfolding debate around them.  

His knee had been **drained of excess blood**, a series of advanced **dermal injectors stabilizing the ligaments and cartilage**. He was sore, stiff, but mostly **bored**.  

Then something caught his ear.  

One of the Xenari **frowned at a molecular readout**, his **bioluminescent bands flickering a troubled shade of cyan-green**.  

“**This compound… is unlike anything we have seen before. It surges through their systems in extreme bursts, triggering a cascade of biochemical responses that defy normal metabolic constraints.**”  

Patel’s brow furrowed.  

He tilted his head, letting his gaze land on the **hologram they were discussing**.  

Slowly rotating in the center of the projection was a **familiar molecular structure**.  

One he had spent years studying in human physiology.  

The aliens **didn’t recognize it**.  

Patel blinked. Then exhaled sharply through his nose, suppressing a chuckle.  

“**Oh right, adrenaline…**” he muttered.  

Silence.  

Every **alien doctor in the room turned toward him**.  

Vireen, **staring at him as if he had just whispered the meaning of existence itself**, **inhaled sharply**.  

“**…Explain.**”  

## The Adrenaline Revelation  

Silence lingered in the trauma bay.  

Dr. Patel’s words hung in the air like **a dropped scalpel on a sterile floor**.  

> “Oh right, adrenaline…”  

The alien physicians **stared** at the **rotating molecular diagram**, their expressions shifting between **scientific intrigue and deepening horror**.  

Vireen **Taa’Sho-Vel’s bioluminescent markings flared wildly**, flickering through a chaotic sequence of colors as her mind raced to process this revelation.  

“**Explain.**”  

### Filling in the Gaps  

Dr. Patel sighed, sitting up slightly. “**Alright, let’s break it down.**”  

He gestured to the screen. “**That compound is called adrenaline. It's a hormone our bodies produce under extreme stress—physical danger, high-stakes situations, anything that requires an immediate response.**”  

Vireen’s **eyes widened**. “**A naturally occurring stimulant? Your bodies create this on their own? Without external administration?**”  

“**Exactly.**”  

Dr. Evelyn Park, despite the dull ache of her stitched-up wound, took over.  

She nodded. “**It increases heart rate, dilates airways, diverts energy to muscles, and suppresses pain stimulus almost completely.**”  

She **glanced at the Kryllians**, hoping to find **common ground** in metaphor.  

“**You know when your assemblers need to work overtime to meet a delivery deadline? It’s like that—the body essentially goes into overdrive, prioritizing speed, strength, and reflexes at the cost of long-term stability.**”  

One of the Kryllian surgeons **clicked nervously**, his plated fingers tapping against his medical console. “**At the cost of stability? Elaborate.**”  

Staff Sergeant Logan Carter, still grinning despite the dark bruises blooming across his skin, **waved a hand lazily**.  

“**Oh yeah, it’s terrible for you in the long run. Prolonged exposure screws up your organs, can cause heart attacks, weakens the immune system—yada yada. But in the *short term*, in a fight?**”  

He gestured toward the **bloodstained conference hall visible through the trauma bay’s transparent partitions**.  

“**You saw what it does. It makes us unstoppable monsters.**”  

The alien doctors **exchanged looks of muted horror**.  

A Seraphyn physician **rubbed their temples**, prismatic eyes flickering between light spectrums. “**You are telling me your bodies prioritize immediate survival over long-term function? Voluntarily? This is… barbaric.**”  

Dr. Rebecca Henshaw let out a breath, flexing her sore fingers. “**Not voluntarily. It’s an evolutionary response. It kicks in whether we want it to or not.**”  

Vireen’s expression turned **incredulous**. “**This is an innate trait of your entire species?**”  

Dr. Patel leaned back, letting his head rest against the diagnostic bed’s frame. “**Not just us.**”  

He **let that hang for a moment** before continuing.  

“**This response—this chemical cocktail? It’s present in almost every complex lifeform on our planet.**”  

The room **went still**.  

The Kryllian surgeon **clicked again, a nervous, stuttering rhythm**. “**Clarify. You mean… other species on Earth also possess this… process?**”  

Dr. Park exhaled. “**Yes. Mammals, reptiles, birds, even some fish. Anything that evolved under conditions where survival depended on fast reactions developed it.**”  

The alien physicians **looked at one another** in alarm.  

Vireen shook her head slowly, her **bioluminescence dimming to a deep shade of cyan—the Xenari equivalent of unease**. “**I have studied the neurochemistry of countless species, and never—not once—have I encountered anything like this. No other race in the known galaxy possesses a naturally occurring mechanism for… *this level of biological escalation*.**”  

The Kryllian surgeon let out a **low, worried chitter**. “**For what purpose could such an extreme response have evolved? Surely the dangers of your world could not warrant such a—**”  

Carter **laughed sharply**, cutting him off.  

“**Oh, buddy.**”  

He winced as the laugh sent a sharp pain through his ribs.  

Then he grinned wider.  

“**Earth is not a nice place.**”  

### Anecdotes of Strength  

Dr. Patel, rubbing his bruised knee, chuckled. “**I think what he means is, Earth is… uniquely hostile.**”  

He counted off on his fingers.  

“**Extreme weather, high gravity, bacterial infections, competing species, apex predators—**”  

Dr. Henshaw cut in. “**Predators which, I should add, also have this response.**”  

A murmur **rippled through the aliens**.  

Patel nodded. “**Right. And because our ancestors had to fight to survive, they developed the ability to push their bodies beyond normal limits. Adrenaline lets us tap into emergency reserves of strength and speed when we need them.**”  

Dr. Park, ever the scientist, added, “**We have documented cases of people performing impossible feats under adrenaline surges. Like mothers lifting cars off their children after an accident.**”  

A **hushed silence followed**.  

The Seraphyn physician’s **expression flickered through several shades of disbelief**.  

“**That is not possible. Even with adrenaline, the structural integrity of your skeletal system should not—**”  

Patel shook his head. “**It shouldn’t. But it happens. We’ve seen it.**”  

Carter, still grinning, **flexed his bruised knuckles**.  

“**You ever see a human in a fight? Sometimes we move so fast it looks like we’re teleporting. Our reaction time gets so sharp we can dodge attacks without thinking about it.**”  

The Kryllian surgeon, looking **distinctly unnerved**, turned back toward the **holographic displays**, scanning the molecular breakdown.  

“**And this happens automatically? Any time your species is in danger?**”  

Dr. Park sighed, nodding.  

“**Of course, we very much pay the price once the danger’s passed.**”  

She gestured toward her own **stiff, aching body**, then at the others.  

“**With compound interest…**”  

### The Weight of the Revelation  

Vireen took a **shaky step backward**, **trying to absorb the weight of what she had learned**.  

A natural, biologically ingrained combat stimulant. A **pure survival mechanism**, present across **an entire planetary ecosystem**, that allowed the body to operate beyond its **physical limits**.  

No other species in the galaxy had this.  

**No one.**  

And yet, here were the humans, **torn, bloodied, bruised—but still alive, still functioning, still cracking jokes.**  

Still **dangerous.**  

She **exchanged glances** with the Kryllian, then the Seraphyn.  

They were all thinking the same thing.  

They had known **humans were unusual**.  

But this?  

This was something else entirely.  

This was **terrifying**.  

And they had only scratched the surface.
