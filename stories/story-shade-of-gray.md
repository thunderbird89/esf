## Chapter 1: The Calling Card

Special Agent Marisa Comey had learned to trust her gut over fifteen years at the FBI. That morning, walking through the humid Washington air toward the Hoover Building, her gut told her something was off. Nothing concrete—no missed calls, no emergency alerts—just that nagging itch between her shoulder blades that came before the world tilted sideways.

She swiped her badge at the security checkpoint, nodded to the guard, and took the elevator to the fifth floor where the Technology Crimes Division made its home. The halls were already buzzing with the usual morning energy: agents trading coffee for case files, keyboards clattering, phones ringing. Normal. Everything was normal.

She pushed through the glass door to her office, a modest space with a window overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, and froze.

On her desk, centered with almost surgical precision, sat a business card.

Not tossed casually. Not slipped under her keyboard or left on a stack of papers. Dead center, square to the desk's edges, like someone had measured it. The card was matte black with a logo she didn't recognize: a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, two broken swords crossed saltire beneath it. Clean. Professional. Distinctly *not* government issue.

Marisa circled her desk slowly, studying the card from different angles before touching it. Old habits. She'd worked counterintelligence before moving to tech crimes, and unexplained objects on secured federal property set off alarm bells.

She picked it up. Heavy cardstock, expensive. The logo was embossed, catching the light. On the back, handwritten in neat block letters:

**Referred by Langley. Russian EMP tech/domestic extremists. Call ASAP.**

Below that, a phone number. 202 area code. Washington.

Marisa sat down slowly, still holding the card. Langley meant CIA. But the CIA didn't leave cryptic business cards on FBI desks—they sent encrypted emails or made awkward phone calls through liaison channels. They definitely didn't namecheck themselves on handwritten notes.

She turned the card over again, studying the logo. Something about it triggered a memory, but she couldn't place it. The design was memorable—distinctive enough that she'd have remembered seeing it before, yet she didn't.

Her phone buzzed. Text from her supervisor: *Morning briefing moved to 10. Same conference room.*

Marisa looked at the card again. Russian EMP technology. Domestic extremists. Two things that absolutely belonged on the FBI's radar but hadn't crossed her desk yet. Someone knew something she didn't.

She pulled out her phone and photographed the card, front and back, then texted the images to her personal device. Paranoia, maybe, but operational security had kept her alive more than once.

The phone number stared up at her. Call ASAP.

Marisa checked her watch. 0847. She had an hour before the briefing, and if Langley had referred someone to her—assuming this was legitimate—then it probably mattered. If it wasn't legitimate, she'd find out quickly enough.

She picked up her office phone, hesitated, then set it down. Used her cell instead, putting it on speaker as she pulled her notebook close.

The line rang once. Twice.

> "Good morning, Special Agent Comey."

Marisa's hand froze over her notepad. The voice was professional, measured, masculine with a subtle French accent. And the speaker had identified her without her saying a word.

> "This is Special Agent Comey. Who am I speaking with?"

> "You may call me Jeane LeBouf. I represent an organization that operates in partnership with certain elements of the U.S. intelligence community. We have information regarding a credible threat to national security that falls within your jurisdiction."

Marisa wrote quickly: *Jeane LeBouf. Male, French accent. Partnership w/ intel community. Knows my name/desk.*

> "And which organization would that be?"

> "ESF. You'll find our credentials referenced in classified compartments accessible to you through your DOE Q clearance. We operate primarily in the counter-proliferation space."

Marisa pulled up her classified access terminal, fingers flying over the keys. ESF. The search came back with three documents, all marked TOP SECRET with additional caveats she'd never seen before. She didn't have access to open them, but their existence confirmed something was real.

> "I'm seeing references, but I can't access the files."

> "That's expected. Your clearance level permits acknowledgment of our existence but not operational details. What you need to know is this: several months ago, a Russian research facility in Sarov was compromised. Materials relating to electromagnetic pulse weapon development were stolen. Since then, black market movements have indicated components being smuggled into the United States through Eastern Seaboard ports. Our intelligence indicates these materials are now in the hands of a domestic extremist cell."

Marisa's pen stopped moving. EMP weapons. Domestic extremists. This was exactly the kind of nightmare scenario that kept the Bureau's Counterterrorism Division up at night.

> "What kind of extremist cell?"

> "A far-right network. At minimum, a segment of one. They are particularly hostile to LGBTQ+ minorities and believe that triggering infrastructure collapse will catalyze the societal transformation they desire. We assess they're targeting critical infrastructure in a major metropolitan area. The EMP devices they've acquired are crude but functional—sufficient to disable electronics across several city blocks."

> "And you know this how?"

A pause. Brief, but noticeable.

> "We have assets and capabilities beyond traditional intelligence channels. Signals intelligence, human intelligence, technical surveillance. Our methods are unconventional but reliable. The CIA can vouch for our track record, which is why they referred us to you specifically."

Marisa tapped her pen against her notepad. The man's answers were smooth, practiced, but vague enough to avoid giving away operational details. Classic intelligence community behavior.

> "Why the FBI? Why not handle this through CIA or DOD channels?"

> "Because this is a domestic threat on U.S. soil, which makes it Bureau jurisdiction. And because the technical nature of the threat requires your division's expertise. We're not here to circumvent your authority, Agent Comey. We're here to augment it."

> "Augment how?"

> "We offer three things: intelligence analysis, tactical support, and in-field operational assistance. We have a mobile task force positioned to assist with interdiction operations. MTF-34, led by myself, specializes in technology-related threats. We can provide real-time intelligence, electronic warfare support, and tactical intervention if necessary."

MTF-34. Mobile Task Force. Marisa added that to her notes.

> "And what do you want in return?"

> "Coordination. Access to your investigative resources. Liaison authority with your tactical teams. We're not asking to take over your operation, Agent Comey. We're offering to help you succeed."

Marisa leaned back in her chair, studying the business card still sitting on her desk. The logo, the timing, the smoothness of this pitch—it all felt carefully orchestrated. But if the threat was real, if there really were EMP weapons in the hands of domestic terrorists, she couldn't afford to ignore it.

> "I'll need to verify this with my chain of command and with Langley."

> "Of course. Ask for Senior Field Agent Alicia Monroe at CIA. She'll confirm our relationship. Specifically, ask her about Nightingale. In the meantime, we're sending you a preliminary intelligence package. Check your JWICS terminal in the next five minutes."

The line went silent for a moment, and Marisa could hear faint keystrokes in the background.

> "Agent Comey, I understand your caution. But I need you to understand something: we're on a clock. Our assessment indicates the target cell plans to activate their devices within two weeks. Every hour of delay increases the risk of mass casualties."

Marisa's jaw tightened. Two weeks. If this was real, two weeks wasn't enough time for a full investigation, threat assessment, and operational response. They'd need to move fast, cut corners, trust incomplete intelligence.

Exactly the kind of situation that led to disasters.

> "I'll review your package and make some calls. How do I reach you?"

> "The number you called. It's secure. When you're ready to proceed, we'll arrange a face-to-face briefing. There are elements of this situation that can't be discussed over any phone line."

> "Understood."

> "One more thing, Agent Comey." The voice softened slightly, became more personal. "We didn't leave that card on your desk to intimidate you. We left it there to demonstrate that we're serious, that we have capabilities you'll find useful, and that we respect the Bureau's authority enough to come to you directly rather than operating in the shadows. We want to work *with* you, not around you."

Marisa looked at the card again, at the careful placement, the embossed logo, the handwritten note. A demonstration of capability. A calling card, literally.

> "I'll be in touch, Mr. LeBouf."

> "We'll be waiting."

The line went dead.

Marisa sat in silence for a long moment, then swiveled to her classified terminal. The JWICS login screen blinked at her. She entered her credentials, navigated to her secure inbox, and there it was: a new message, timestamped four minutes ago. Subject line: **RUSSIAN EMP PROLIFERATION - THREAT ASSESSMENT**.

Sender: **ESF LIAISON**.

She clicked it open. The document was thorough—thirty pages of intelligence analysis, technical specifications, known associates, geographic indicators, and threat timelines. Photos of shipping manifests, customs documents with annotations, satellite imagery of warehouse facilities in Baltimore and Norfolk. Signal intercepts from cell phones and radios, transcribed and translated.

This wasn't speculative intelligence. This was operational-grade intel, the kind that took months to develop and analyze. And it had been compiled and delivered to her in the time it took to make a phone call.

Marisa scrolled through the document, her unease growing with each page. Everything was too clean, too complete. Either ESF had extraordinary intelligence capabilities, or they'd been tracking this threat for a long time and only now decided to share it.

Or both.

She checked her watch. 0912. Forty-eight minutes until the briefing. She needed to read this entire document, verify what she could, and figure out what to tell her supervisor. And she needed to call Langley.

She reached for her secure phone, then stopped. Her gut was back, that itch between her shoulder blades. The same instinct that had warned her this morning was now screaming a different message:

Whatever was about to happen, it was bigger than EMP weapons and domestic terrorists.

She looked at the business card one more time, at the logo with its crossed broken swords.

*We Are Watching.*

The phrase had been nagging at her, and now she realized why. She'd heard it before, years ago, in a different context. A counterintelligence briefing about unexplained interventions in foreign operations. Mysterious third parties who appeared, resolved situations, and vanished. Always leaving the same calling card.

Marisa picked up the phone and dialed Langley.

Time to find out what was really going on.
