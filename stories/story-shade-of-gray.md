# Shade of Gray

## Chapter 1: The Calling Card

Special Agent Marisa Comey had learned to trust her gut over fifteen years at the FBI. That morning, walking through the humid Washington air toward the Hoover Building, her gut told her something was off. Nothing concrete—no missed calls, no emergency alerts—just that nagging itch between her shoulder blades that came before the world tilted sideways.

She swiped her badge at the security checkpoint, nodded to the guard, and took the elevator to the fifth floor where the Technology Crimes Division made its home. The halls were already buzzing with the usual morning energy: agents trading coffee for case files, keyboards clattering, phones ringing. Normal. Everything was normal.

She pushed through the glass door to her office, a modest space with a window overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, and froze.

On her desk, centered with almost surgical precision, sat a business card.

Not tossed casually. Not slipped under her keyboard or left on a stack of papers. Dead center, square to the desk's edges, like someone had measured it. The card was matte black with a logo she didn't recognize: a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, two broken swords crossed saltire beneath it. Clean. Professional. Distinctly *not* government issue.

Marisa circled her desk slowly, studying the card from different angles before touching it. Old habits. She'd worked counterintelligence before moving to tech crimes, and unexplained objects on secured federal property set off alarm bells.

She picked it up. Heavy cardstock, expensive. The logo was embossed, catching the light. On the back, handwritten in neat block letters:

**Referred by Langley. Russian EMP tech/domestic extremists. Call ASAP.**

Below that, a phone number. 202 area code. Washington.

Marisa sat down slowly, still holding the card. Langley meant CIA. But the CIA didn't leave cryptic business cards on FBI desks—they sent encrypted emails or made awkward phone calls through liaison channels. They definitely didn't namecheck themselves on handwritten notes.

She turned the card over again, studying the logo. Something about it triggered a memory, but she couldn't place it. The design was memorable—distinctive enough that she'd have remembered seeing it before, yet she didn't.

Her phone buzzed. Text from her supervisor: *Morning briefing moved to 10. Same conference room.*

Marisa looked at the card again. Russian EMP technology. Domestic extremists. Two things that absolutely belonged on the FBI's radar but hadn't crossed her desk yet. Someone knew something she didn't.

She pulled out her phone and photographed the card, front and back, then texted the images to her personal device. Paranoia, maybe, but operational security had kept her alive more than once.

The phone number stared up at her. Call ASAP.

Marisa checked her watch. 0847. She had an hour before the briefing, and if Langley had referred someone to her—assuming this was legitimate—then it probably mattered. If it wasn't legitimate, she'd find out quickly enough.

She picked up her office phone, hesitated, then set it down. Used her cell instead, putting it on speaker as she pulled her notebook close.

The line rang once. Twice.

> "Good morning, Special Agent Comey."

Marisa's hand froze over her notepad. The voice was professional, measured, masculine with a subtle French accent. And the speaker had identified her without her saying a word.

> "This is Special Agent Comey. Who am I speaking with?"

> "You may call me Jeane LeBouf. I represent an organization that operates in partnership with certain elements of the U.S. intelligence community. We have information regarding a credible threat to national security that falls within your jurisdiction."

Marisa wrote quickly: *Jeane LeBouf. Male, French accent. Partnership w/ intel community. Knows my name/desk.*

> "And which organization would that be?"

> "ESF. You'll find our credentials referenced in classified compartments accessible to you through your DOE Q clearance. We operate primarily in the counter-proliferation space."

Marisa pulled up her classified access terminal, fingers flying over the keys. ESF. The search came back with three documents, all marked COSMIC TOP SECRET with additional caveats she'd never seen before. She didn't have access to open them, but their existence confirmed something was real.

> "I'm seeing references, but I can't access the files."

> "That's expected. Your clearance level permits acknowledgment of our existence but not operational details. What you need to know is this: several months ago, a Russian research facility in Sarov was compromised. Materials relating to electromagnetic pulse weapon development were stolen. Since then, black market movements have indicated components being smuggled into the United States through Eastern Seaboard ports. Our intelligence indicates these materials are now in the hands of a domestic extremist cell."

Marisa's pen stopped moving. EMP weapons. Domestic extremists. This was exactly the kind of nightmare scenario that kept the Bureau's Counterterrorism Division up at night.

> "What kind of extremist cell?"

> "A far-right network. At minimum, a segment of one. They are particularly hostile to LGBTQ+ minorities and believe that triggering infrastructure collapse will catalyze the societal transformation they desire. We assess they're targeting critical infrastructure in a major metropolitan area. The EMP devices they've acquired are crude but functional—sufficient to disable electronics across several city blocks."

> "And you know this how?"

A pause. Brief, but noticeable.

> "We have assets and capabilities beyond traditional intelligence channels. Signals intelligence, human intelligence, technical surveillance. Our methods are unconventional but reliable. The CIA can vouch for our track record, which is why they referred us to you specifically."

Marisa tapped her pen against her notepad. The man's answers were smooth, practiced, but vague enough to avoid giving away operational details. Classic intelligence community behavior.

> "Why the FBI? Why not handle this through CIA or DOD channels?"

> "Because this is a domestic threat on U.S. soil, which makes it Bureau jurisdiction. And because the technical nature of the threat requires your division's expertise. We're not here to circumvent your authority, Agent Comey. We're here to augment it."

> "Augment how?"

> "We offer three things: intelligence analysis, tactical support, and in-field operational assistance. We have a mobile task force positioned to assist with interdiction operations. MTF-34, led by myself, specializes in technology-related threats. We can provide real-time intelligence, electronic warfare support, and tactical intervention if necessary."

MTF-34. Mobile Task Force. Marisa added that to her notes.

> "And what do you want in return?"

> "Coordination. Access to your investigative resources. Liaison authority with your tactical teams. We're not asking to take over your operation, Agent Comey. We're offering to help you succeed."

Marisa leaned back in her chair, studying the business card still sitting on her desk. The logo, the timing, the smoothness of this pitch—it all felt carefully orchestrated. But if the threat was real, if there really were EMP weapons in the hands of domestic terrorists, she couldn't afford to ignore it.

> "I'll need to verify this with my chain of command and with Langley."

> "Of course. Ask for Senior Field Agent Alicia Monroe at CIA. She'll confirm our relationship. Specifically, ask her about Nightingale. In the meantime, we're sending you a preliminary intelligence package. Check your JWICS terminal in the next five minutes."

The line went silent for a moment, and Marisa could hear faint keystrokes in the background.

> "Agent Comey, I understand your caution. But I need you to understand something: we're on a clock. Our assessment indicates the target cell plans to activate their devices within two weeks. Every hour of delay increases the risk of mass casualties."

Marisa's jaw tightened. Two weeks. If this was real, two weeks wasn't enough time for a full investigation, threat assessment, and operational response. They'd need to move fast, cut corners, trust incomplete intelligence.

Exactly the kind of situation that led to disasters.

> "I'll review your package and make some calls. How do I reach you?"

> "The number you called. It's secure. When you're ready to proceed, we'll arrange a face-to-face briefing. There are elements of this situation that can't be discussed over any phone line."

> "Understood."

> "One more thing, Agent Comey." The voice softened slightly, became more personal. "We didn't leave that card on your desk to intimidate you. We left it there to demonstrate that we're serious, that we have capabilities you'll find useful, and that we respect the Bureau's authority enough to come to you directly rather than operating in the shadows. We want to work *with* you, not around you."

Marisa looked at the card again, at the careful placement, the embossed logo, the handwritten note. A demonstration of capability. A calling card, literally.

> "I'll be in touch, Mr. LeBouf."

> "We'll be waiting."

The line went dead.

Marisa sat in silence for a long moment, then swiveled to her classified terminal. The JWICS login screen blinked at her. She entered her credentials, navigated to her secure inbox, and there it was: a new message, timestamped four minutes ago. Subject line: **RUSSIAN EMP PROLIFERATION - THREAT ASSESSMENT**.

Sender: **ESF LIAISON**.

She clicked it open. The document was thorough—thirty pages of intelligence analysis, technical specifications, known associates, geographic indicators, and threat timelines. Photos of shipping manifests, customs documents with annotations, satellite imagery of warehouse facilities in Baltimore and Norfolk. Signal intercepts from cell phones and radios, transcribed and translated.

This wasn't speculative intelligence. This was operational-grade intel, the kind that took months to develop and analyze. And it had been compiled and delivered to her in the time it took to make a phone call.

Marisa scrolled through the document, her unease growing with each page. Everything was too clean, too complete. Either ESF had extraordinary intelligence capabilities, or they'd been tracking this threat for a long time and only now decided to share it.

Or both.

She checked her watch. 0912. Forty-eight minutes until the briefing. She needed to read this entire document, verify what she could, and figure out what to tell her supervisor. And she needed to call Langley.

She reached for her secure phone, then stopped. Her gut was back, that itch between her shoulder blades. The same instinct that had warned her this morning was now screaming a different message:

Whatever was about to happen, it was bigger than EMP weapons and domestic terrorists.

She looked at the business card one more time, at the logo with its crossed broken swords.

*We Are Watching.*

The phrase had been nagging at her, and now she realized why. She'd heard it before, years ago, in a different context. A counterintelligence briefing about unexplained interventions in foreign operations. Mysterious third parties who appeared, resolved situations, and vanished. Always leaving the same calling card.

Marisa picked up the phone and dialed Langley.

Time to find out what was really going on.

---

The CIA's main switchboard answered on the second ring. Marisa identified herself, requested Senior Field Agent Alicia Monroe, and waited through the usual security protocols. A transfer. Hold music. Another transfer. She checked her watch again. 0918.

> "This is Monroe."

The voice was crisp, professional, with an edge that suggested she'd been interrupted in the middle of something important.

> "Ms. Monroe, this is Special Agent Marisa Comey, FBI Technology Crimes Division. I apologize for the cold call, but I need to verify some information."

A pause.

> "Go ahead."

> "I received a contact this morning from someone claiming to represent an organization called ESF. They left a business card on my desk—inside a secured federal building—and have provided detailed intelligence on a domestic terrorism threat. They told me to ask you about them. Specifically, they mentioned something called Nightingale."

The silence on the other end stretched long enough that Marisa wondered if the connection had dropped. Then Monroe spoke, her voice quieter, more measured.

> "Where are you calling from?"

> "My office. FBI headquarters."

> "Secure line?"

> "Yes."

Another pause. Marisa could hear papers rustling, a door closing.

> "All right. What do you want to know?"

> "Are they legitimate? Can I trust their intelligence?"

> "Yes and yes." Monroe's response was immediate, no hesitation. "ESF is... they're real. They've worked with us before. Successfully."

> "Nightingale?"

Monroe exhaled slowly.

> "Nightingale was an asset extraction. Moscow. Last year. It should have been impossible—deep penetration, multiple layers of FSB surveillance, hostile territory. We had no options, no angle, no way to get our guy out without triggering an international incident." She paused. "ESF made it happen. I still don't know how. One day our asset was burned and trapped, the next day he was sitting in a safe house in Prague. Like magic."

Marisa wrote quickly, underlining *Moscow extraction* and *impossible* in her notes.

> "So they're some kind of special operations unit? DOD black budget?"

> "I don't know what they are." Monroe's voice carried a strange mix of frustration and awe. "I've tried to find out. I've pulled every string I have access to, called in favors, dug through archives. There's almost nothing. Just scattered references in old case files, always at the edges. They show up when situations are impossible, they fix them, and they disappear."

> "But you trust them."

> "I don't know a lot myself, despite my contact, but I can tell you this: whatever they promise you, no matter how impossible-sounding or outlandish a promise, it will come true. I don't know how they do it, and frankly I don't think I want to know, but they can do anything."

Marisa stared at the business card on her desk, at the embossed logo that had somehow appeared in her locked office overnight.

> "They've promised tactical support. A mobile task force. Electronic warfare capabilities."

> "Then you'll get it." Monroe's certainty was absolute. "Agent Comey, I'll be honest with you. Whatever operation you're about to run with them, it's going to work. It's going to work in ways that don't make sense, that shouldn't be possible. You're going to see things that will make you question what you know about technology, about logistics, about what's achievable. My advice? Don't ask too many questions. Don't dig too deep. Just let them do what they do and be grateful for the results."

> "That's not how we work. Chain of custody, evidence protocols, operational oversight—"

> "I know." Monroe cut her off gently. "Believe me, I know. But ESF doesn't operate like anyone else. They can't. And if they're coming to you directly, offering cooperation, that means the threat is real and it's serious. They don't show up for small problems."

Marisa looked at the intelligence package on her screen. Thirty pages of perfect intelligence. EMP weapons in the hands of extremists. Two weeks until activation.

> "Can you tell me anything else about them? Leadership? Chain of command? Legal authority?"

> "No. And honestly, I'm not sure anyone can. What I know is operational. They deliver. Every time. That's enough for me."

It wasn't enough for Marisa. Not by a long shot. But she understood what Monroe was saying. Sometimes you had to work with incomplete information. Sometimes you had to trust results over process.

> "If I need to reach you again about this?"

> "Call my direct line. I'll send you the number after we hang up." Monroe paused. "Agent Comey? One more thing. When you meet them—and you will meet them—pay attention. Watch how they work. You might learn something that changes how you think about everything."

> "Like what?"

> "Like what's actually possible in this world."

The line went dead before Marisa could respond.

She sat back in her chair, staring at her notes. Moscow extraction. Impossible situations. Promises that always come true. Technology that shouldn't exist. An organization that operated at the edges of documented history, fixing problems that couldn't be fixed.

Her secure phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number: Monroe's direct line, followed by a brief message.

*Trust them. You won't regret it. —AM*

Marisa looked at her watch. 0927. Thirty-three minutes until the briefing. She pulled up the ESF intelligence package again and started reading in earnest, taking detailed notes on known associates, suspected locations, and tactical vulnerabilities.

If she was going to work with ESF—and it seemed she had little choice—she needed to understand the threat first. The questions about her new partners could wait.

But they wouldn't wait forever.

---

The next thirty minutes passed in a blur of cross-referencing and verification. Marisa pulled up Customs and Border Protection databases, checked shipping manifests against the intelligence package, and ran queries through FinCEN's financial intelligence systems. Every check came back positive. The shipments were real. The companies listed as importers existed but were shell corporations with suspicious ownership structures. The cargo descriptions matched materials that could be used in EMP device construction.

By 0955, she had confirmed enough to make her blood run cold. Over the past two months, at least seven separate shipments had arrived at Baltimore, Norfolk, Philadelphia, and Newark. High-voltage capacitors. Triggered spark gap switches. Ferrite cores. Copper winding. Battery systems capable of rapid discharge. Each shipment innocuous on its own, but together they formed a shopping list for electromagnetic pulse weapons.

The components weren't just enough for one device. They could build several.

Marisa grabbed her tablet, loaded with her notes and key excerpts from the ESF package, and headed for Conference Room 3B. Her supervisor, Assistant Director Nathan Reeves, was already there, along with two other senior agents from the division and a counterterrorism specialist she recognized from the fourth floor.

> "Comey." Reeves nodded as she entered. "You said this was urgent."

> "Sir, we have a credible threat. Domestic terrorism. Multiple EMP devices in the hands of a far-right extremist network."

The room went quiet. Reeves set down his coffee cup with careful precision.

> "Walk us through it."

Marisa connected her tablet to the room's display system and pulled up the first image: the ESF business card, logo clearly visible.

> "At approximately 0845 this morning, I found this on my desk. Inside my locked office. It references a CIA referral and mentions Russian EMP technology and domestic extremists."

> "How did it get inside your office?" The counterterrorism specialist—Agent Marcus Chen—leaned forward, frowning.

> "Unknown. I'm still trying to determine that. But what matters is the intelligence it led to." She advanced to the next screen: excerpts from the ESF package. "The contact provided detailed intelligence on a theft from a Russian research facility in Sarov several months ago. Materials related to electromagnetic pulse weapon development. Since then, black market tracking has indicated components being smuggled into the United States."

She clicked through images of shipping manifests, customs documents, satellite photos of warehouse facilities.

> "In the limited time I had this morning, I ran cross-checks through CBP and FinCEN. Every shipment highlighted in the source material corresponds to real imports. Seven separate deliveries over the past two months to East Coast ports." She paused, making eye contact with each person in the room. "The components match technical specifications for crude but functional EMP devices. Based on the quantities imported, we're looking at the capability to construct at least four, possibly six devices."

Reeves's face had gone pale. Chen was frantically taking notes on his tablet.

> "Target assessment?" Reeves asked, his voice tight.

> "Far-right extremist network with particular hostility toward LGBTQ+ communities. The source assesses they're planning to target critical infrastructure in a major metropolitan area to trigger what they view as catalyzing societal collapse." Marisa advanced to the timeline. "Estimated timeline: two weeks until potential activation."

> "Jesus Christ." The words came from Agent Sarah Kovacs, one of the senior tech crimes investigators. "Do we have locations? Names?"

> "The source material includes partial information on known associates, suspected safe houses, and warehouse facilities. But it's incomplete. The source has offered to provide tactical support and real-time intelligence to assist with interdiction."

> "The source." Reeves fixed her with a sharp look. "Who exactly is this source?"

> "An organization called ESF. They claim to operate in partnership with elements of the intelligence community, specifically CIA. I verified their credentials with a Senior Field Agent at Langley this morning. She confirmed their legitimacy and vouched for their operational effectiveness."

> "ESF." Chen was already typing. "Never heard of them."

> "You wouldn't have. They're compartmented. I found references in classified systems but no accessible files at my clearance level." Marisa took a breath. "Sir, the CIA contact was very clear: ESF has capabilities beyond conventional intelligence and tactical units. She described them as operating at the edges, appearing when situations are impossible, and making things happen that shouldn't be possible."

The room fell silent. Reeves exchanged glances with Chen, then looked back at Marisa.

> "Your assessment? Is this legitimate or some kind of elaborate hoax?"

> "The intelligence is real. I've verified enough of it independently to confirm that. The shipments exist, the materials match, the timeline is plausible. Whether ESF is exactly what they claim to be..." She hesitated. "I can't say for certain. But their capabilities are clearly extraordinary. They accessed a secured federal building overnight, left physical evidence on my desk, and compiled intelligence that would take us months to develop on our own."

Reeves rubbed his face, the weight of the decision visible in every line.

> "If this is real, we're looking at a catastrophic attack. EMP devices in a major city could disable emergency services, hospitals, transportation, communications. Mass casualties from secondary effects alone." He looked around the table. "We can't afford to ignore this. But we also can't afford to be played."

> "Sir," Marisa said carefully, "the CIA contact told me that ESF doesn't show up for small problems. If they're here, offering direct cooperation, the threat is real."

Another silence. Then Reeves made his decision.

> "All right. Comey, you're lead on this. I'm assigning you Ops Suite 7 and giving you clearance to requisition whatever resources you need. You'll coordinate with Chen's counterterrorism team and with tactical units as required." He paused, his jaw tight. "And you're authorized to issue temporary facility badges to your ESF contacts."

Kovacs looked up sharply.

> "Sir, we're giving unknown contractors access to FBI headquarters?"

> "If what Comey says is true, they'll show up whether we invite them or not." Reeves's voice was grim. "This way, we can at least keep an eye on them. And if they can help us stop this threat, we need them." He turned back to Marisa. "But Comey, you watch them. Every move. Every word. I want to know exactly what we're dealing with."

> "Yes, sir."

> "Chen, I want a full briefing packet for the Director within two hours. Kovacs, start pulling everything we have on far-right extremist networks with anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. Cross-reference with anyone who has technical sophistication or access to specialized equipment." He stood. "We have two weeks. Let's move."

The room emptied quickly, agents heading for their stations. Marisa remained for a moment, staring at the business card still displayed on the screen. The wireframe globe. The broken swords. The laurels.

*We Are Watching.*

She pulled out her phone and dialed the number from the card.

It was time to meet her new partners.

## Chapter 2: Outside Assistance

The next morning, Marisa arrived at FBI headquarters at 0730, earlier than usual. She'd spent most of the previous evening coordinating with Chen's counterterrorism team, reviewing threat assessments, and trying not to think too hard about what she was about to invite into her investigation.

She'd called LeBouf the afternoon before. The conversation had been brief, professional. He would arrive at 0900 with credentials and biometrics for temporary badge processing. No mention of how many people would be coming. No details on capabilities or equipment. Just a calm assurance that MTF-34 was ready to assist.

Ops Suite 7 was on the third floor, a secure workspace with dedicated terminals, a conference table, multiple displays, and enough room for a small team. Marisa had already loaded the ESF intelligence package onto the suite's isolated network and set up workstations for cross-referencing and analysis. By 0845, everything was ready.

She stood in the lobby at 0855, watching the security checkpoint. Her phone buzzed: a text from an unknown number.

*Arriving now. —JL*

Thirty seconds later, Jeane LeBouf walked through the main entrance.

He was remarkably unremarkable. Around six-one, but he walked with the slight slouch of someone who spent altogether too much time in front of screens, making him seem shorter than he should be. His hair was lightly graying—not distinguished silver, just the fading that came with age—and his features had a plainness that seemed to deflect attention. His face was the kind you'd struggle to describe five minutes after meeting him: average proportions, forgettable structure, the sort of appearance that made him disappear in a crowd of three.

Marisa tried to place his age from his features and found it almost impossible. The graying suggested forties, maybe early fifties, but his face could have belonged to someone ten years younger or older. He wore an off-the-rack suit in charcoal gray—the kind someone making an average salary might buy to look professional but not ostentatious. The fit was acceptable but not tailored, the fabric serviceable but not expensive.

Everything about him radiated middle management mediocrity. The kind of person you'd shake hands with at a networking event and forget by the time he let go.

Yet he spotted her immediately and crossed the lobby with a quiet efficiency that suggested awareness beyond what his appearance implied.

> "Special Agent Comey. A pleasure to meet you in person."

His handshake was firm but unremarkable, his voice carrying that subtle French accent she'd heard on the phone. Marisa found herself already having trouble fixing his features in memory, as if her brain didn't want to commit the details to long-term storage.

> "Mr. LeBouf. Thank you for coming." She kept her voice neutral, professional. "I'll need to process your credentials and biometrics for a temporary facility badge."

> "Of course." He produced a wallet and extracted a driver's license. Virginia. The photo matched the unremarkable face in front of her.

They processed him through security in silence. Fingerprinting, iris scan, badge photo. The biometric systems took longer than usual, flagging anomalies twice before finally clearing him. Marisa made a mental note of that. When the badge printer finally produced his credential, she handed it over with no small amount of suspicion.

> "This gives you access to the third floor operations area and approved conference rooms. Nowhere else without escort."

> "Understood." LeBouf clipped the badge to his suit jacket. "Shall we?"

They rode the elevator in silence. Marisa studied him peripherally, looking for tells, but found herself struggling to focus on him. He stood quietly, hands loose at his sides, posture slightly hunched. His eyes tracked the floor indicator with the vacant attention of someone accustomed to boring commutes. Nothing about him suggested operator training or tactical awareness. He could have been an IT contractor, a mid-level analyst, an accountant.

Yet when the elevator dinged and the doors opened, he moved aside with perfect spatial awareness, letting her exit first without making it seem deliberate. The gesture was so natural, so unremarkable, that she almost missed how precisely he'd positioned himself to maintain sight lines to both the elevator interior and the hallway beyond.

> "How many team members will be joining us?" she asked as they exited on the third floor.

> "For now, just myself." He followed her down the corridor. "MTF-34 operates with a small footprint. Additional personnel will be deployed only as needed for tactical operations."

> "And your role?"

> "Coordination and intelligence analysis. I serve as the interface between ESF capabilities and your investigative process."

That told her precisely nothing. Marisa keyed them into Ops Suite 7 and gestured to the workstations.

> "I've loaded the intelligence package you provided onto our isolated network. We've confirmed the shipments and begun cross-referencing against known extremist networks. What we need now are the gaps—associates, locations, communication channels."

LeBouf set his tablet on the conference table and pulled out a phone—not a standard smartphone, but something sleeker, with a matte black finish and no visible branding.

> "Before we begin, I should clarify ESF's operational parameters." His tone was measured, almost apologetic. "We operate with certain... restrictions on information sharing. Methodology, sources, specific technical capabilities—these remain compartmented. What I can provide are actionable intelligence products and tactical support. The how and why behind them must remain opaque."

Marisa crossed her arms.

> "That's going to be a problem. Chain of custody, evidence admissibility—"

> "The intelligence we provide will be sufficient for you to develop parallel construction through traditional means." LeBouf's expression was patient. "We identify leads. You verify them through conventional channels. By the time any evidence reaches a courtroom, it will have been obtained through legally defensible methods."

> "Parallel construction." Marisa's voice was flat. "You're asking me to launder intelligence."

> "I'm asking you to save lives." LeBouf met her eyes steadily. "The how of our intelligence gathering would not survive judicial scrutiny. The what of our intelligence is accurate and actionable. We provide the former so you can legitimately obtain the latter. It's not ideal, but it works."

Marisa wanted to argue, to push back against the fundamental wrongness of the approach. But she'd worked counterintelligence. She knew how the game was played when national security trumped procedural purity. And if the threat was real—and her verification suggested it was—then saving lives had to take priority over legal perfectionism.

> "I don't like it," she said finally.

> "Neither do I, Agent Comey. But it's the price of effectiveness." He turned to his tablet. "Shall we begin?"

Over the next hour, they worked through the known shipments, mapping delivery locations to suspected warehouse facilities. Kovacs joined them briefly with a preliminary report on extremist networks, then returned to her own analysis. Chen stopped by twice for updates.

Marisa noticed LeBouf made several phone calls throughout the morning, always stepping away from the main workstations, voice low but audible enough to catch fragments.

> "Cipher, I need signals intercept on the Baltimore warehouse... yes, any activity in the last seventy-two hours..."

Ten minutes later:

> "Shade, can you pull traffic camera footage for the Newark facility? I need vehicle identification..."

When he returned from the second call, Marisa couldn't help herself.

> "Cipher and Shade. Your team members?"

LeBouf's expression remained neutral.

> "Outside assistance. They provide specialized support for certain technical requirements."

> "What kind of specialized support?"

> "The kind that allows us to move quickly." He tapped his tablet, pulling up a new screen. "Speaking of which, I have a potential lead on the Newark shipment. There's a warehouse in Elizabeth registered to a company called Patriot Logistics. Shell corporation, same ownership structure as the importers. No legitimate business activity, but utility records show power consumption consistent with climate control and security systems."

Marisa pulled up the business registry. He was right—the ownership chain led back to the same network of LLCs that had received the shipments.

> "How did you identify this?"

> "Cross-referencing corporate structures against utility databases, property records, and financial transactions." LeBouf's tone suggested he was reciting a script. "Standard investigative work."

It wasn't standard. That kind of analysis would take days, not minutes. But Marisa let it slide. For now.

By 1300, they'd identified three high-priority locations across two states. Each matched the profile: shell company ownership, suspicious utility patterns, proximity to the shipment delivery points. LeBouf made another call, this one even more cryptic.

> "Cipher, I need confirmation on the Elizabeth warehouse. Any signals activity... right, check encrypted traffic too, anything that doesn't match normal patterns..."

When he returned, he had a new piece of information.

> "The Elizabeth location shows suspicious wireless traffic. Encrypted burst transmissions at irregular intervals, consistent with security systems or remote monitoring. Worth surveillance."

Marisa stared at him.

> "You identified wireless traffic patterns at a specific location in the last five minutes."

> "My colleague has access to specialized monitoring equipment."

> "What kind of monitoring equipment?"

> "The effective kind." LeBouf's expression remained maddeningly calm. "Agent Comey, I understand your frustration. But the capabilities I'm describing—while unconventional—are within the technical realm of possibility. We simply have resources and authorizations that allow us to move faster than traditional investigative processes."

It was a polite way of saying shut up and accept the results. Marisa didn't like it, but she couldn't argue with the effectiveness. In six hours, they'd developed more leads than her team would have generated in a week.

---

The pattern continued over the next three days.

Each morning, LeBouf arrived precisely at 0900, badged in with the same forgettable efficiency, and spent the day working alongside Marisa's team in Ops Suite 7. He had a remarkable ability to fade into the background—sitting at a workstation, typing quietly, occasionally making notes on his tablet. Other agents would walk past him without seeming to register his presence. Twice, Marisa watched Kovacs enter the suite, look around as if searching for someone, then leave without acknowledging LeBouf despite him sitting in plain view.

He was professional, focused, and consistently productive. He also made an unsettling number of phone calls to his mysterious "outside assistance," always stepping into the hallway where his unremarkable presence would draw even less attention.

On day two, they hit a dead end tracking one of the shell companies. The ownership chain disappeared into a maze of offshore entities, and conventional database queries yielded nothing. LeBouf excused himself, stepped into the hallway, and had a brief conversation with someone he addressed as Cipher.

Fifteen minutes later, he returned with a complete breakdown of the ownership structure, including the names of the actual beneficial owners buried under six layers of LLCs and Panamanian holding companies.

> "How did you get this?" Marisa demanded, staring at the document on his tablet.

> "Financial intelligence analysis. My colleague has access to certain international banking records."

> "The kind of access that requires subpoenas and international cooperation agreements?"

> "The kind of access that produces results." LeBouf's tone remained patient. "Agent Comey, would you prefer to wait three weeks for the proper paperwork, or would you prefer to verify this information through parallel investigation and move forward with the operation?"

She chose the latter. She wasn't proud of it.

Day three brought another impossibility. They'd identified a suspected safe house in Maryland but had no concrete evidence of occupation or activity. LeBouf made another call to Shade, speaking in rapid French that Marisa's high school education couldn't quite follow. When he returned, he pulled up a series of images on his tablet.

> "Ring doorbell camera from a house two doors down, traffic camera at the intersection, and a Tesla's dashcam from a vehicle that parked nearby yesterday." He swiped through the images, each showing the same two individuals entering and leaving the safe house at various times. "Facial recognition matches two of the known associates from the initial intelligence package."

Marisa looked at the timestamps. The images had been captured over the past forty-eight hours. The Tesla footage was from a camera that shouldn't be accessible without the owner's permission. The Ring camera required either a warrant or voluntary cooperation. The traffic camera needed city authorization.

LeBouf had obtained all of it in under twenty minutes.

> "Your colleague hacked into private security cameras and vehicle systems."

LeBouf's expression didn't change.

> "My colleague accessed publicly visible recording devices through legally ambiguous but technically achievable means. The footage exists. Whether it's admissible in court is irrelevant if it allows you to develop probable cause through traditional surveillance."

> "That's not how the law works—"

> "That's exactly how operational reality works." For the first time, LeBouf's calm cracked slightly. "Agent Comey, we have eleven days until these devices potentially activate. Eleven days to identify locations, map networks, and interdict a distributed terror cell. I can get you the intelligence you need to do that, but I cannot get it through methods that satisfy your legal comfort. So you have a choice: accept the intelligence and use it to build a parallel case, or maintain procedural purity while people die. Which would you prefer?"

The silence stretched between them. Marisa knew he was right. Hated that he was right. But couldn't argue with the logic.

> "Show me the footage," she said finally.

By the end of day three, they'd identified six priority locations, compiled dossiers on eight suspected network members, and established a preliminary movement pattern that suggested coordination between cells. Every piece of intelligence had come from LeBouf's mysterious contacts—Cipher and Shade, whose capabilities seemed to extend into every digital system in the modern world.

Late that afternoon, Marisa stood at the Ops Suite window, watching LeBouf make yet another call in the hallway. His voice drifted through the partially open door.

> "Shade, I need the Signal message history for this number... yes, I know it's encrypted, that's why I'm asking you..."

Marisa felt her stomach drop. Signal was end-to-end encrypted. Breaking that encryption was supposed to be impossible without physical access to the device. Even the NSA couldn't do it reliably. Yet LeBouf spoke as if it were a trivial request.

When he returned, he had transcripts.

> "Encrypted Signal messages between two of the known associates. They're discussing a meeting tomorrow in Philadelphia. Location is coded, but context suggests the warehouse we identified on Tacony Street."

Marisa stared at the transcripts. They were real—the metadata, the timestamps, the message structure all matched Signal's format.

> "You broke Signal encryption."

> "My colleague accessed endpoint data through alternative means." LeBouf's expression gave nothing away. "The how is irrelevant. The what is actionable."

Alternative means. Endpoint access. The euphemisms piled up, each one a polite fiction covering capabilities that shouldn't exist. Marisa thought about the CIA agent's words: *they can do anything.* It was starting to feel less like hyperbole and more like understatement.

That evening, after LeBouf had left for the day, Marisa sat alone in Ops Suite 7, staring at the digital evidence board they'd constructed. Every lead, every connection, every piece of critical intelligence had come from phone calls to Cipher and Shade. Not from traditional investigative work. Not from legal surveillance. From two individuals whose capabilities suggested access to—

She stopped the thought before completing it. Access to *what*, exactly? Ring cameras and traffic feeds could be explained through hacking, though the speed was suspicious. Financial records might involve leaked databases or compromised banking systems. But Signal encryption? Endpoint access suggested either physical compromise of the devices or capabilities that bordered on science fiction.

Marisa pulled up the case file and began documenting their progress, carefully crafting each entry to focus on results rather than methodology. Parallel construction, as LeBouf had called it. Intelligence laundering, as she thought of it.

She looked at the evidence board again, at the web of connections they'd built in just three days. Locations identified. Networks mapped. Communications intercepted. A terror cell that should have taken months to penetrate, laid bare in seventy-two hours.

Alicia Monroe's words echoed in her mind: *whatever they promise you, no matter how impossible-sounding or outlandish a promise, it will come true.*

Marisa was beginning to understand what that really meant. ESF didn't just have better resources or faster access. They had capabilities that implied something far more disturbing: either they'd achieved surveillance technology decades ahead of anything she'd seen, or they had access to systems and networks that weren't supposed to be accessible at all.

Cipher and Shade weren't just outside assistance. They were apparently inside *everything*.

---

The rest of the week became a methodical dismantling of the network, piece by piece.

By Thursday, they'd identified twelve members of the extremist cell, tracked seven vehicles, and pinpointed four operational warehouses. Each day brought new breakthroughs that would have been impossible without LeBouf's mysterious contacts. A bank transaction here, a cell phone ping there, a fragment of intercepted communication that led to the next thread. FBI surveillance teams moved into position around the Maryland safe house and the Philadelphia warehouse, confirming what ESF's intelligence had predicted: coordinated activity, regular movements, suspicious deliveries.

Marisa coordinated with Chen's counterterrorism team, feeding them sanitized intelligence that could be officially attributed to traditional investigative methods. They obtained proper warrants based on "anonymous tips" that happened to align perfectly with LeBouf's illegally-acquired intelligence. The parallel construction was working, slowly building a case that would survive judicial scrutiny even as it depended entirely on capabilities that shouldn't exist.

On Friday morning, they made their first arrests. Two network members in Baltimore, caught loading equipment into a van under FBI surveillance. The search warrant—obtained through proper channels after LeBouf had identified the location—turned up high-voltage capacitors and battery systems. Not enough for a complete device, but enough to charge both men with conspiracy.

Marisa watched the arrest through drone footage in Ops Suite 7, feeling the satisfaction of a successful operation tempered by the knowledge of how they'd really gotten there. LeBouf stood beside her, his unremarkable face showing no emotion as federal agents handcuffed the suspects.

> "Two down," she said quietly. "Ten to go. Plus however many we haven't identified yet."

> "Progress." LeBouf's tone was neutral. "But we're running out of time. They'll know we're closing in. Smart operators go to ground when associates start disappearing."

He was right. By Friday afternoon, the intercepted communications had shifted. More coded language. Shorter messages. Signs of operational security tightening.

That evening, LeBouf stepped out for another call to Cipher. When he returned fifteen minutes later, his unremarkable features carried a hint of tension that Marisa had learned to recognize as concern.

> "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

> "What kind of problem?"

> "Cipher's monitoring shows the network is accelerating their timeline. Chatter suggests they're aware of our pressure and moving up their schedule." He pulled up his tablet, displaying a series of intercepted messages. "There's another shipment expected. Final components for at least two more devices."

Marisa leaned over the display, scanning the intelligence. The messages were fragments, coded references that would mean nothing to anyone who didn't already know what they were looking for.

> "When?"

> "Tomorrow evening. Saturday. Newark docks, berth thirty-seven." LeBouf's fingers moved across the tablet, pulling up satellite imagery. "Container ship arriving from Hamburg via Rotterdam. One of their front companies has a legitimate import scheduled—industrial electronics. Perfect cover for the real cargo."

> "Tomorrow." Marisa checked her watch. Friday, 1845. "That gives us less than twenty-four hours to plan an interdiction."

> "Yes. And if we miss it, they'll have everything they need to complete multiple devices. Possibly activate within days rather than the original timeline." LeBouf met her eyes. "This is the moment, Agent Comey. We either stop them at the docks or we're chasing them through a much more dangerous endgame."

Marisa pulled out her phone and dialed Chen. He answered on the second ring.

> "Chen, I need a tactical team. Newark docks, tomorrow evening. Priority operation."

A pause on the other end.

> "What's the target?"

> "Final shipment for the EMP devices. We interdict at the docks or they go dark with everything they need." She looked at LeBouf, who nodded confirmation. "I need HRT assets. Full tactical package."

> "HRT's deployed in Seattle on another operation. I can get you Agent Hartfield's team. They're based out of Quantico, specialist in urban assault and high-risk interdiction. Good people."

Marisa had heard of James Hartfield. Former Special Forces, recruited to the FBI's elite tactical units, known for precise operations in complex environments. If Chen was recommending him, that was enough.

> "Get him. I'll brief him tonight. Operation goes at whatever time that container ship docks."

> "Understood. I'll have him at headquarters by 2000."

The line went dead. Marisa turned back to LeBouf.

> "Your people. MTF-34. Will they be there?"

LeBouf's expression shifted slightly—not quite a smile, but something close to satisfaction.

> "Yes. The rest of the team will meet us at the Newark docks tomorrow evening. They'll provide tactical support and electronic warfare coverage." He paused. "Agent Comey, I should warn you: this will be the first time you see ESF operate in the field. It will be... different from conventional law enforcement operations."

> "Different how?"

> "Different in ways that will answer some of your questions about our capabilities. And likely raise many more."

Alicia Monroe's words came back to her: *You're going to see things that will make you question what you know about technology, about logistics, about what's achievable.*

Marisa had a feeling tomorrow night would be exactly what Monroe had warned her about.

---

Agent James Hartfield arrived at FBI headquarters precisely at 2000, accompanied by three members of his tactical team. He was tall, maybe six-three, with the build and bearing of someone who'd spent a career in violent professions. His handshake was firm, his eyes sharp, and within five minutes of entering Ops Suite 7, he'd assessed every exit, sight line, and potential threat vector in the room.

Marisa walked him through the intelligence: the network, the shipments, the accelerated timeline, and the planned interdiction. Hartfield listened without interrupting, occasionally making notes on his tablet.

LeBouf sat in the background, unremarkable and easily overlooked, until Marisa introduced him.

> "This is Jeane LeBouf. He represents ESF, a partner organization that's been providing intelligence support. His team will be joining us at the docks for tactical support."

Hartfield's eyes flicked to LeBouf, then back to Marisa. Something in his expression suggested he was reserving judgment.

> "ESF. Not familiar with that designation."

> "Compartmented," Marisa said, using the explanation that had become routine. "They operate in partnership with intelligence community elements. Specialized capabilities."

> "What kind of specialized capabilities?"

LeBouf spoke before Marisa could respond, his voice carrying its usual patient neutrality.

> "Electronic warfare, signals intelligence, tactical coordination. MTF-34 specializes in technology-focused threat interdiction. We'll provide overwatch and technical support while your team handles the direct action."

Hartfield nodded slowly, but Marisa could see he was filing away questions for later.

They spent the next two hours planning the operation. The container ship was scheduled to dock at 2145. The target container would be offloaded by 2300. Hartfield's team would establish positions covering the berth, ready to move when the extremist cell arrived to collect their cargo. LeBouf would coordinate with MTF-34 for electronic surveillance and communications intercept.

By 2200, they had a plan. By 2230, Hartfield and his team had departed to prepare. By 2300, Marisa was alone in Ops Suite 7, staring at satellite imagery of the Newark docks and trying not to think about what "different from conventional law enforcement operations" might actually mean.

Her phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number—LeBouf's secure device.

*MTF-34 will be in position by 2100 tomorrow. You'll recognize us when you see us. —JL*

Marisa stared at the message. *You'll recognize us when you see us.* That should have been reassuring. Instead, it sent a chill down her spine.

She thought about the past week. The impossible intelligence. The capabilities that shouldn't exist. Cipher and Shade with their fingers in every network and device. LeBouf's calm certainty that whatever ESF promised would come true.

Tomorrow night, she'd finally see what ESF could actually do in the field.

She pulled up Alicia Monroe's contact information and stared at it for a long moment before finally calling.

Monroe answered on the third ring.

> "Agent Comey. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again."

> "Tomorrow night. Newark docks. We're interdicting the final shipment. ESF is sending their tactical team."

A long pause.

> "So you're about to see them work."

> "Yes. LeBouf said it would be different from conventional operations."

> "He's not wrong." Monroe's voice carried something Marisa couldn't quite identify. Not quite amusement, not quite warning. "Agent Comey, remember what I told you. Whatever you see tomorrow, don't ask too many questions. Just let them do what they do."

> "That's not very reassuring."

> "It's not meant to be. It's meant to be practical." Monroe paused. "Good luck. You're going to need it. Not because the operation will fail—it won't. But because after tomorrow night, you're going to understand why some questions shouldn't be asked."

The line went dead.

Marisa sat in the empty ops suite, surrounded by screens showing intelligence that shouldn't exist, planning an operation with partners whose capabilities defied explanation.

She thought about Hartfield and his team, preparing for what they assumed would be a conventional tactical operation. She thought about LeBouf with his unremarkable face and his remarkable contacts. She thought about MTF-34, whoever and whatever they were, preparing to deploy to the Newark docks.

*You're going to see things that will make you question what you know about technology, about logistics, about what's achievable.*

Marisa had a feeling that by tomorrow night, she and Hartfield would both understand exactly what Alicia Monroe had been trying to warn them about.

## Chapter 3: Recognition

The staging area was an empty warehouse two blocks from the Newark docks, condemned and forgotten, perfect for a covert operation. Hartfield's team arrived first at 2030, parking their unmarked vehicles in the loading bay and conducting a methodical sweep of the perimeter. By the time Marisa pulled up in her Bureau sedan at 2045, they'd already established a secure perimeter and set up a mobile command post.

Hartfield met her at the door, dressed in full tactical gear. Body armor over black fatigues, helmet with integrated communications, rifle held with the casual competence of someone who'd carried weapons for most of his adult life. His three team members were similarly equipped, moving through final equipment checks with practiced efficiency.

> "Agent Comey." Hartfield's nod was professional, his eyes scanning the street behind her. "Your ESF contacts haven't arrived yet."

> "They will." Marisa checked her watch. 2047. "LeBouf said they'd be in position by 2100."

> "About that." Hartfield gestured toward the makeshift command post—a folding table with laptops, radios, and tactical displays. "I'd like to coordinate our movement with theirs before we deploy. Standard procedure when working with... outside elements."

The pause before "outside elements" suggested he had questions. Marisa couldn't blame him.

They were reviewing the operational timeline when headlights swept across the warehouse entrance. A grey minivan, completely unremarkable, the kind of vehicle that blended into any parking lot in America. It pulled into the loading bay with careful precision, parking beside Hartfield's tactical vehicles.

For a moment, nobody moved. Then the van's side door slid open.

The first figure that emerged made Marisa's breath catch.

The man wore a black bodysuit overlaid with angular panels that caught the dim warehouse light in strange ways, seeming to shift and flow as he moved. The panels weren't quite rigid, weren't quite flexible, but something in between that suggested technology she didn't recognize. The helmet was integrated seamlessly with the suit, no visible seam where neck met collar, its shape angular and almost alien with subtle indentations and protrusions that suggested sensors or equipment she couldn't identify. Three clusters of small lenses were mounted on the helmet's face—four lenses per cluster, arranged vertically—glowing a dim, unsettling red. Two clusters sat where eyes might be on a human face, the third centered above them. With LeBouf's visor retracted, these lens clusters were dark and inert, pushed to the sides of his helmet.

But his visor was retracted, and Marisa recognized the unremarkable face beneath the helmet.

LeBouf.

Except everything else about him had changed. The slouch was gone. He moved with fluid, predatory efficiency, weight balanced on the balls of his feet, every gesture precise and economical. His eyes swept the warehouse with systematic awareness, cataloging threats and angles with the automatic competence of someone who'd survived situations far worse than a dockside interdiction. The middle-management mediocrity had vanished, replaced by something that made Marisa's hindbrain recognize a dangerous predator.

Two more figures followed him out of the van, identically equipped. Their visors were down, rendering their faces invisible behind smooth black surfaces, and on these operators the lens clusters glowed with that same dim red light—twelve small points arranged in three groups of four, giving them an insect-like, almost alien appearance. They moved with the same unsettling precision, fluid and coordinated, as if every gesture had been calculated for maximum efficiency.

Beside her, Marisa heard Hartfield's sharp intake of breath.

The three ESF operators approached, and she could hear it now: a faint humming sound emanating from their equipment. Even without seeing their eyes behind the visors, she could feel their gaze on her and Hartfield's team—methodical, assessing, aware of everything. Not quite electrical, not quite mechanical, but something that made the air feel charged. The sound raised the hairs on her arms.

Each of them carried rifles that were wrong in ways Marisa's eyes struggled to process. They were sleek and angular like the armor, but the proportions were off. The barrels were too thin, barely wider than her thumb, and they hummed with the same unsettling frequency as the suits. No visible magazines, no ejection ports, no iron sights—just smooth surfaces and subtle glowing indicators that pulsed with a soft blue light.

One of Hartfield's team members—a veteran tactical officer named Rodriguez—took an involuntary step back. Even Hartfield's posture had shifted slightly, the subtle tensing of someone whose combat instincts were screaming warning.

LeBouf stopped a respectful distance away, but there was nothing deferential in his stance. He stood like someone completely in control of any battlefield, ready for anything, the kind of operator who'd walked out of situations that should have been fatal. His unremarkable face seemed almost jarring now, a forgettable mask on something far more dangerous.

> "Agent Comey. Agent Hartfield." His voice was the same patient, accented tone she'd heard all week. "MTF-34 is ready to support your operation."

Hartfield found his voice first, though it carried an edge Marisa hadn't heard before.

> "What the hell am I looking at?"

LeBouf's expression didn't change.

> "Specialized tactical equipment. As I mentioned, we operate differently from conventional law enforcement."

> "That gear—" Hartfield gestured at the suits, the helmets, the impossible rifles. "I've never seen anything like it. Not in the military, not in any tactical unit I've worked with. What is it?"

> "Effective." LeBouf's tone suggested the question was expected but wouldn't be answered. He reached into a pouch on his suit and produced four small devices, each no larger than a hearing aid. "For your team. Encrypted communications. They'll help you stay in touch better when things are loud."

Hartfield took the devices, examining them with a trained eye. They were sleek, seamless, with no visible buttons or controls. Just smooth black surfaces with a faint blue glow at one end.

> "These aren't standard FBI comms."

> "No. They're better." LeBouf gestured to his helmet. "We'll coordinate through these. Range is effectively unlimited within the operational area, encryption is unbreakable, and they'll automatically filter and prioritize relevant communications. Put them in, press the blue end to activate."

Hartfield distributed the devices to his team, but Marisa could see the questions building behind his eyes. The way he held the earpiece, turned it over in his hand, suggested he was cataloging everything wrong with the situation.

One of the ESF operators—Marisa couldn't tell which was which with the visors down—spoke for the first time. The voice was filtered through the helmet, slightly distorted but clear.

> "We have full tactical overview established. Network surveillance active. Target container is being offloaded now, berth thirty-seven as predicted."

The voice was feminine, calm, with an accent Marisa couldn't quite place.

> "And the targets?" LeBouf asked.

> "Two vehicles en route. ETA fourteen minutes. Three individuals confirmed in lead vehicle, two in trailing vehicle." A pause. "All five match profiles from the intelligence package. This is the pickup team."

Marisa's eyes widened. They'd been on site for what, five minutes? And they already had real-time surveillance of both the container and the incoming vehicles?

> "How did you—" she started.

LeBouf interrupted gently.

> "We have access to certain monitoring capabilities. The details aren't important. What matters is that we have fourteen minutes to get into position before the targets arrive."

Hartfield's jaw was tight, but he nodded slowly.

> "All right. My team moves to positions alpha through delta, covering all approaches to the berth. Your team—" he paused, clearly struggling with what to call them, "—provides overwatch and electronic support as discussed."

> "Agreed." LeBouf's tone carried quiet authority. "We'll be in position within three minutes. You'll have full communications coverage and tactical data feed through the earpieces."

The three ESF operators turned and moved back toward the van with that same unsettling fluid precision. As they walked away, LeBouf gave a slight nod, and the two halves of his visor slid together in front of his face with a soft snap, sealing seamlessly without a visible seam. The lens clusters on either side of his helmet came to life, twelve small points of dim red light now matching his teammates', transforming him from a forgettable man in advanced gear into something far more alien.

Marisa watched them go, trying to process what she'd just seen. The way LeBouf moved now, the casual readiness in his stance—it was like watching a different person wearing the same forgettable face.

Hartfield stepped closer to her, his voice low.

> "Agent Comey, I need you to tell me what the hell we're working with here. That equipment—it's not military surplus, it's not experimental tech I've heard about, it's not anything that should exist."

> "I don't know," Marisa admitted. The honesty felt necessary. "I've been working with LeBouf all week. He's been providing intelligence through... unconventional means. But this is the first time I've seen them operate in the field."

> "That gear looks like something out of a DARPA fever dream. Twenty years ahead of anything I've seen." He looked at the earpiece in his hand. "And these things are telling me they have real-time vehicle tracking on targets fourteen minutes out. That's not surveillance, Comey. That's something else."

Marisa thought about the past week. Cipher and Shade with access to every network and device. Signal encryption broken like it was nothing. Intelligence that appeared in minutes instead of months. LeBouf's calm certainty that whatever ESF promised would come true.

Monroe had tried to warn her. She was seeing it now. And it was worse than she'd imagined.

> "I know," she said quietly. "But right now, we need them. Those targets will be here in thirteen minutes, and we need to stop this shipment. Whatever questions we have about ESF—they wait until after the operation."

Hartfield stared at her for a long moment, then nodded grimly.

> "After the operation, you and I are having a very long conversation about who the hell we're working with."

He turned to his team, voice shifting to command mode.

> "All right, listen up. Insert these comms. We move in two minutes. Positions alpha through delta as briefed. Rules of engagement: observe, identify, detain. No shots unless absolutely necessary. Our partners will provide overwatch and electronic support."

He paused, looking at the earpieces.

> "And whatever you see or hear from the ESF team tonight—you keep it to yourselves until we debrief. Clear?"

A chorus of acknowledgments. Professional, disciplined, but Marisa could see the unease in their eyes. They'd all seen the gear, heard the humming, felt the wrongness of it.

She inserted her own earpiece, pressing the blue end as LeBouf had instructed. For a moment, nothing. Then a soft tone, and suddenly the world opened up.

Voices in crystal clarity, layered but distinct. Hartfield coordinating with his team. The filtered helmet voice of one of the ESF operators providing updates. And underneath it all, a faint background hum that felt like standing next to a power transformer.

Then a new voice, calm and precise, speaking directly into her ear. The voice was strangely genderless, neither masculine nor feminine, with a measured cadence that was somehow deeply reassuring. The kind of voice you'd want in your ear during a firefight.

> "Agent Comey, this is Shade. I'm providing tactical coordination for this operation. Your earpiece is now linked to our tactical network. You'll receive real-time updates on target positions, environmental conditions, and relevant intelligence."

Marisa's blood ran cold. Shade. One of the mysterious contacts who'd been providing LeBouf with impossible intelligence all week. Not a person in an office somewhere, but here, now, speaking directly into her ear.

> "Where are you?" she asked quietly.

> "Providing support." The genderless voice carried a hint of something that might have been amusement. "You'll see us soon enough. For now, focus on the operation. Targets are twelve minutes out."

Marisa looked toward the warehouse entrance, where Hartfield's team was preparing to deploy. The grey minivan sat empty now, the ESF operators already gone.

Somewhere out there, in the maze of shipping containers and industrial equipment surrounding the Newark docks, three figures in impossible gear were moving into position.

And Marisa had a sinking feeling that what she'd seen so far was just the beginning.

## Chapter 4: Overwatch

The Newark docks at night were a landscape of shadows and harsh sodium lights, industrial geometry stretched across acres of concrete and steel. Shipping containers stacked four high created artificial canyons, their corrugated walls painted in faded reds, blues, and rusts. Overhead cranes loomed like mechanical dinosaurs, their skeletal frames silhouetted against the orange glow of the city beyond.

Marisa crouched behind a stack of pallets two hundred meters from the target warehouse, watching Hartfield's team move into position through the thermal optic mounted on her borrowed rifle. The weapon felt foreign in her hands—she was an investigator, not a tactical operator—but Hartfield had insisted she be armed and equipped like the rest of the team.

Through her earpiece, she could hear the steady rhythm of operational communications. Hartfield's voice, calm and professional, directing his team to their positions. Rodriguez acknowledging from position Alpha, covering the warehouse's north entrance. Two other agents—Martinez and Chen—reporting from positions Beta and Gamma, establishing overlapping fields of fire.

And underneath it all, that strange background hum from the ESF communications system, like standing near high-voltage lines.

> "All positions, this is Hartfield. Sound off when in position."

One by one, the FBI agents confirmed. Marisa watched through her optic as they settled into cover, professional and practiced. Good positioning, good spacing, proper security. Everything by the book.

Then Shade's genderless voice cut through the channel, and Marisa felt her stomach tighten.

> "Overwatch established. We have full visual coverage of the operational area. Targets are nine minutes out, proceeding as predicted."

> "Overwatch, Hartfield. What's your position?"

A pause, and Marisa could almost hear the smile in Shade's voice.

> "Where we need to be, Agent Hartfield. You'll see us if the situation requires it. Until then, focus on your team. We'll guide you in."

Hartfield's jaw must have been tight, but his voice remained professional.

> "Copy that. All positions, standby for further guidance."

Marisa scanned the surrounding area, looking for any sign of the ESF operators. The lens clusters, the distinctive helmets, the impossible gear—they should have been visible somewhere in this industrial maze. But there was nothing. Just shadows and shipping containers and the distant rumble of trucks on the highway.

> "Agent Comey," Shade said, speaking directly to her now. "We're tracking your position. You're exposed on your eastern flank. Recommend moving three meters left, behind the concrete barrier. There's a sightline from the warehouse's second-floor window that could compromise you."

Marisa looked left. There was indeed a concrete barrier, waist-high, providing better cover. And when she glanced at the warehouse, she could see the window Shade had mentioned—currently dark, but a potential threat vector.

She moved, settling behind the barrier. Through her earpiece, she heard what might have been approval.

> "Better. You're learning."

> "Overwatch, Rodriguez." The tactical officer's voice carried a note of confusion. "How are you tracking our positions? I don't see any drones, no aerial assets."

> "We have other methods, Agent Rodriguez. Trust that we see what we need to see."

> "That's not an answer—"

> "Rodriguez, Hartfield. Stay focused on the mission."

But Marisa had heard the edge in Rodriguez's voice. She understood it. The idea that ESF could track their positions, see their movements, without any visible surveillance platform was unsettling in ways that went beyond operational security.

The minutes ticked by. Through her earpiece, she heard Shade providing a steady stream of updates. The target vehicles were seven minutes out. Six minutes. Five. Each update came with precise timing, as if ESF had access to GPS tracking on the extremists' vehicles.

Which, Marisa realized with growing unease, they probably did.

> "All positions, Shade. Targets are three minutes out. First vehicle is a white Ford F-150, license plate Jersey Tango-Seven-Three-Charlie-Hotel-Niner. Three occupants, all male, mid-twenties to early thirties. Second vehicle is a grey Dodge Ram, Jersey Bravo-Four-Two-Echo-Kilo-Eight. Two occupants, both male, similar age range."

Marisa pulled up the intelligence package on her phone, cross-referencing the descriptions. The vehicle details matched known associates. So did the physical descriptions Shade was providing.

> "How are you getting these details?" Hartfield's voice was carefully neutral, but Marisa could hear the questions underneath. "Visual confirmation requires line of sight."

> "We have line of sight, Agent Hartfield. Among other things."

Marisa's eyes swept the dockyard again. Where the hell were they? The ESF operators had to be somewhere, had to have positioned themselves for visual observation. But there was nothing. No movement, no signatures, no indication of three operators in advanced tactical gear.

Unless they were somewhere she couldn't see. Somewhere with elevation and clear sightlines. She tilted her head back, looking at the massive container cranes overhead.

There. On one of the crane platforms, maybe sixty meters up, she caught the briefest glint of light reflecting off angular surfaces. A figure, barely visible against the night sky, rendered almost invisible by the darkness and the angle. As she watched, the figure shifted slightly, and she saw the faint red glow of lens clusters.

One of the ESF operators. Perched on a crane platform like some kind of predatory bird.

She keyed her mic.

> "Overwatch, this is Comey. I have visual on one of your operators. North crane, upper platform."

> "Confirmed. That's Dozer. He has primary overwatch from that position."

> "How did he get up there? Those cranes have security locks, no access without—"

> "Agent Comey, respectfully, the how is less important than the results. Dozer has optimal sightlines from that position. Focus on your sector."

Marisa's hands tightened on her rifle. The casual dismissal, the implication that questions were unwelcome—it grated against everything she'd learned about proper operational procedure. But Monroe's words echoed in her head. *Don't ask too many questions. Just let them do what they do.*

The next two minutes passed in tense silence. Marisa could see the other FBI positions now, her eyes adjusting to the industrial darkness. Rodriguez was fifty meters to her left, pressed against a shipping container with his rifle trained on the warehouse entrance. Martinez held the southern approach, barely visible behind a forklift. Hartfield had positioned himself near the main access road, ready to call the move when the time came.

Movement caught Marisa's eye. High above, atop the container stacks. A figure in black, moving with fluid precision across the corrugated metal surface. One of the ESF operators. Even from this distance, she could see the smooth, predatory grace of the movement—no wasted motion, no sound carrying down to ground level. The operator paused at the edge of one stack, then leaped.

For a moment, the figure was airborne, silhouetted against the sodium lights. Then a brief pulse of dim blue light from their back—so faint Marisa almost missed it—and the operator's trajectory shifted mid-air, carrying them smoothly to the next container stack eight feet away. They landed without a sound, without any visible impact, immediately flowing into a low crouch and continuing forward.

Marisa's breath caught. That wasn't human. Humans didn't jump like that, didn't land like that, didn't move with that kind of impossible silence while wearing tactical gear and carrying weapons.

> "Did anyone else just see—" Rodriguez's voice, barely a whisper.

> "Saw it," Martinez confirmed. "How the hell did they—"

> "Focus," Hartfield cut in, but Marisa heard the edge in his voice. He'd seen it too.

Another figure appeared on the containers, this one closer to Rodriguez's position. The ESF operator moved at what should have been a full sprint, but made no sound. Not the clang of boots on metal, not the rustle of equipment, nothing. Just smooth, efficient movement that covered ground faster than seemed physically possible. The red glow of their lens clusters swept the area in methodical patterns, and Marisa found herself holding her breath when that alien gaze passed over her position.

> "Targets are ninety seconds out," Shade announced. "All positions maintain coverage. We're detecting additional heat signatures inside the warehouse. Revising count upward."

> "How many?" Hartfield's voice was sharp.

> "Twelve total. All armed. Weapons consistent with AR-pattern rifles. They're staged in three groups—four near the loading bay, five in the main floor area, three on the second floor providing overwatch."

Marisa's blood ran cold. Twelve armed extremists. The intel had suggested five, maybe six. But twelve changed everything. Changed the tactical balance, changed the risk assessment, changed whether this operation should proceed at all.

> "Overwatch, Hartfield. That's a significant revision from our intelligence. Confidence level?"

> "High confidence. We have thermal, electromagnetic, and acoustic signatures. Twelve individuals, all carrying metal-framed weapons, all positioned as described."

> "How the hell—" Rodriguez started, then caught himself. "Never mind. Not the time."

But Marisa heard what he'd almost said. The question they were all thinking. How could ESF have thermal imaging, electromagnetic detection, and acoustic sensors capable of distinguishing individual weapons from this distance? That would require equipment that didn't exist outside classified military programs. Equipment that certainly shouldn't be in the hands of a shadowy organization operating on U.S. soil.

Through her earpiece, she heard Hartfield making rapid calculations.

> "All positions, be advised we're facing a larger force than anticipated. Maintain position. We proceed only if we can maintain tactical advantage. Overwatch, what's your assessment?"

> "Proceed," Shade said without hesitation. "We have clear sightlines on all twelve targets. If engagement becomes necessary, we can provide suppression and direction. Your team maintains the arrest authority. We're here to ensure you don't get killed in the process."

The bluntness was almost refreshing. At least ESF wasn't pretending this was a standard operation.

> "Copy that," Hartfield said. "All positions, weapons tight unless I give the word. This is a law enforcement operation. We detain, we don't engage unless absolutely necessary."

Hartfield shifted his position, moving to get a better angle on the warehouse entrance. As he did, he caught movement in his peripheral vision. One of the ESF operators, pressed against the corner of a shipping container thirty meters away. The figure moved with that same unnatural silence, bringing their rifle up in a smooth motion.

But instead of quick-peeking around the corner like any trained operator would, the ESF agent extended just the barrel of their weapon around the edge, keeping their body in cover. They held it there for several seconds, the rifle angled as if they were looking through the optic. Then they pulled back, adjusted position, and flowed around the corner with the absolute certainty of someone who'd already seen what was waiting.

Hartfield's jaw tightened. The rifle. They were seeing through the rifle somehow. Getting a visual feed from sensors or cameras mounted on the weapon itself, letting them observe without exposing themselves to return fire. He filed the observation away with all the other impossible things he'd seen tonight. Questions for later. Much later.

Marisa watched the access road. Headlights appeared in the distance, two sets, approaching at moderate speed. No rush, no indication they suspected anything wrong. The white F-150 led, the grey Dodge Ram following twenty meters behind.

Her finger rested alongside the trigger guard, not on the trigger itself. Bureau training. Don't touch the trigger until you're ready to shoot.

> "Targets entering the kill zone," Shade announced. "First vehicle slowing. Driver is scanning the area. Passenger is on a phone—wait, ending the call. They're pulling up to the loading bay."

The F-150 came to a stop thirty meters from Marisa's position. She had a clear view through her optic. Three men, just as Shade had described. The driver killed the engine. Nobody moved for a moment.

Then Rodriguez's voice, barely a whisper through the comms.

> "Jesus Christ. It's like they can see where people are *looking*, not just where they are."

Marisa's head snapped around. Rodriguez had shifted position slightly, just a few inches, probably to get a better angle on the second vehicle. An unconscious tactical adjustment. But she'd heard the wonder in his voice. How the hell had ESF known he needed to adjust before he'd even done it?

Movement to her right. Close. Too close. An ESF operator materialized from the shadows between containers, moving parallel to her position. The figure ran in complete silence, covering ground in long, loping strides that should have made noise, should have clanged against metal surfaces, should have *announced* their presence. But there was nothing. Just the faint hum of their equipment and the dim red glow of lens clusters sweeping the area with mechanical precision.

The operator passed within ten meters of her position, and Marisa got a clear view. The way they moved was wrong in ways that made her hindbrain scream warnings. Too smooth, too efficient, like watching a predator that had evolved for a hundred million years longer than humanity. Every motion flowed into the next with perfect economy, no wasted energy, no hesitation. And through it all, that complete, absolute silence.

Then the figure was gone, disappearing into the maze of containers as if they'd never existed.

Marisa's hands were shaking. She forced them still, forced herself to focus on the warehouse, on the mission. But the image stayed with her. The smooth, inhuman efficiency. The silence. The sense that she was watching something that shouldn't exist outside of nightmares or science fiction.

A new voice cut through the channel. Male, deep, with a faint accent Marisa couldn't place. Not Shade. Not LeBouf. One of the other ESF operators.

> "Dozer here. Affirmative, Agent Rodriguez. Our systems track ocular direction and attention focus. We can see what you're looking at, where your attention is directed. Helps us coordinate movements and prevent friendly fire."

The casual confirmation sent a chill down Marisa's spine. Track ocular direction. Attention focus. That implied sensors capable of detecting eye movement, pupil dilation, maybe even neural activity patterns through their helmets and equipment. Technology that made every science fiction movie she'd ever seen look conservative.

Rodriguez's voice came back, carefully controlled but carrying an edge of disbelief.

> "That's... that's not possible. Not with any technology I know about."

> "Fortunate, then, that you have access to technology you don't know about." Dozer's tone was matter-of-fact, almost amused. "Second vehicle stopping now. All occupants are armed. Two with concealed carry, three with rifles in the truck beds. The man exiting the passenger side of the F-150 has his hand near his waistband. Weapon is a Glock 19, loaded, one in the chamber."

Marisa watched through her optic as the man Dozer described stepped out of the truck. Young, maybe twenty-six, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. His right hand hovered near his belt, fingers twitching. She couldn't see the weapon from this angle, but she didn't doubt it was there.

Because ESF could apparently see through clothing now. Or detect metal signatures. Or read body language with inhuman precision.

Or all of the above.

> "Overwatch, Hartfield. Continue tracking. All positions, standby. We move when all targets are out of their vehicles and committed to entering the warehouse."

The five men from the trucks gathered near the loading bay door, talking in low voices. Through the enhanced audio in her earpiece—another capability she hadn't known the ESF comms possessed—Marisa could hear fragments of conversation.

"—should be ready by now—"

"—Marcus said they finished the second unit—"

"—move everything tonight, get it staged—"

The loading bay door rolled up with a grinding metallic sound. Light spilled out, illuminating the five men. Behind them, inside the warehouse, Marisa could see movement. More figures. The twelve Shade had counted.

> "All targets are now consolidated," Shade said. "Warehouse interior shows three on the upper level, nine on the main floor. Optimal time for interdiction is when the exterior team enters the building. Spacing will separate them from the main group for approximately thirty seconds. Agent Hartfield, recommend you initiate on my mark."

Hartfield's voice was steady, professional.

> "Copy that. All positions, prepare to move on my mark. Remember, this is an arrest operation. Verbal commands first, force only if necessary."

Marisa shifted her weight, readying herself. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Fifteen years with the Bureau, and she'd never been in a tactical operation like this. Never had to move on armed suspects with this kind of tactical complexity.

The five men from the trucks stepped through the loading bay entrance, disappearing into the warehouse interior. Through the open door, Marisa could see them greeting the others inside. Handshakes. Casual conversation. Men who thought they were safe, who had no idea federal agents were closing in.

> "Exterior team is inside," Shade announced. "Separation is optimal. Three seconds. Two. One. Mark."

> "All positions, move now," Hartfield commanded. "FBI! Nobody move!"

Marisa broke from cover, rifle up, moving toward the loading bay entrance. Around her, the other FBI agents converged on the warehouse from multiple angles. Hartfield led from the front, his voice cutting through the night.

> "Federal agents! Hands in the air! Down on the ground!"

Shouts erupted from inside the warehouse. Confusion. Panic. Men scrambling for weapons, for cover, for any kind of response to the sudden assault.

Marisa was twenty meters from the entrance when Martinez stumbled.

It happened fast. His boot caught on something—a piece of debris, a length of chain, something in the darkness—and he went down hard. His rifle clattered against concrete, the metallic sound echoing across the dockyard like a gunshot.

LeBouf's voice cut through the comms instantly, sharp and clear. The calm patience was gone, replaced by something harder. The accent was more pronounced now, the word snapping out with barely contained urgency.

> "Merde. Go loud."

The night exploded.

Gunfire erupted from inside the warehouse. The sharp crack of rifles, muzzle flashes strobing through the loading bay entrance. Someone inside had seen Martinez fall, heard the clatter of his weapon, and made the logical calculation. The extremists were shooting first.

Hartfield's voice cut through the chaos, edged with controlled urgency.

> "Contact! Weapons free! Suppress and advance!"

The FBI agents opened up, controlled three-round bursts from their M4s. The familiar *crack-crack-crack* of rifle fire echoed across the dockyard, punctuated by the metallic *ting* of brass hitting concrete. Marisa pressed herself against her concrete pillar, her hands shaking, her mind racing. Martinez was still exposed, still crawling, rounds kicking up sparks and concrete chips around him.

Then the ESF weapons joined the fight.

The sound was wrong. Not the sharp report of conventional firearms, not even the suppressed *crack* of subsonic rounds through a silencer. Instead, a rapid *zwip-zwip-zwip*—the sound of something very small moving very, very fast. Like a high-speed nail gun crossed with a camera shutter, each shot barely audible over the chaos but somehow cutting through it.

Marisa's head snapped toward the source. One of the ESF operators—she couldn't tell which—had taken a position atop a shipping container thirty meters away. The figure stood in full view, completely exposed, rifle shouldered with mechanical precision. The weapon pulsed with that strange *zwip* sound in rapid succession, and through the warehouse entrance, Marisa saw extremists dropping.

Not wounded. Dropped. Clean, instant incapacitations. A man bringing his rifle to bear on Martinez jerked backward, his weapon clattering away. Another extremist, moving toward the loading bay door, crumpled mid-stride. A third, half-visible behind a pallet, simply collapsed.

No blood spray. No dramatic reactions. Just immediate, clinical neutralization.

> "Second floor shooters neutralized," came a filtered voice—not Shade, not LeBouf. The third operator. "Upstairs is clear."

Marisa looked up. Through the warehouse's second-floor windows, she could see figures slumped against walls, weapons dropped. The second ESF operator had taken them all out in seconds, firing from somewhere she still couldn't see. The *zwip-zwip-zwip* of their weapon had been nearly drowned out by the FBI's M4s, but the results were undeniable.

> "Martinez, move!" Rodriguez shouted. "Go, go, go!"

Martinez scrambled to his feet, sprinting for cover as the FBI team maintained suppressing fire. He made it behind a concrete barrier, breathing hard, and immediately brought his rifle back up.

Then LeBouf moved.

Marisa caught the motion in her peripheral vision—a figure launching from the top of a container stack. Not jumping. *Launching*. That same brief pulse of dim blue light from his back, and suddenly he was airborne, arcing toward the warehouse entrance in a trajectory that physics shouldn't allow.

He covered twenty meters in the air, clearing the FBI positions entirely, and came down just inside the loading bay entrance with impossible precision. The impact should have shattered his ankles, should have sent him sprawling. Instead, he landed in a perfect crouch, absorbed the force without a sound, and immediately flowed into motion.

An extremist emerged from behind a stack of crates, rifle swinging toward LeBouf. The ESF operator was faster. He pivoted, and his leg came up in a forward kick that looked almost lazy in its execution but moved with blinding speed.

The kick caught the extremist square in the chest.

The man *flew*. Not stumbled, not staggered—flew. His body lifted completely off the ground and sailed backward a good eight feet before slamming into the concrete wall behind him with a sickening *crack*. He crumpled, unconscious before he hit the floor, his rifle spinning away across the warehouse floor.

Marisa's mouth fell open. That wasn't human strength. That was hydraulic power, mechanical force, something augmented and amplified beyond anything biology could produce. The casual efficiency of it—the way LeBouf had barely seemed to exert himself—made it even more terrifying.

> "Jesus Christ," Rodriguez breathed over the comms. "What the hell was that?"

LeBouf didn't pause. He flowed forward into the warehouse, his rifle coming up. The *zwip-zwip-zwip* of his weapon joined the other ESF operators, each shot precise and measured. More extremists dropped. Marisa could see them through the entrance now, trying to mount a defense, trying to return fire, but ESF was everywhere and nowhere, moving faster than the extremists could track.

Hartfield's voice cut through, professional instincts overriding his shock.

> "All positions, advance! Martinez, Rodriguez, take the left flank. Chen, with me on the right. Agent Comey, provide cover from your position."

The FBI team moved, training and discipline pushing them forward despite the surreal nature of what they were witnessing. They flowed through the loading bay entrance in textbook formation, weapons up, calling out targets and sectors.

Hartfield entered first, Martinez covering his six. The warehouse interior was chaos—scattered crates, fallen extremists, the acrid smell of gunpowder mixing with something else, something sharp and metallic that Hartfield couldn't identify. He moved tactically, clearing corners, his M4 tracking potential threats.

LeBouf was ahead of him, maybe fifteen feet, moving through the space with that same fluid efficiency. His visor was down now, the smooth black faceplate broken only by those twelve points of red light arranged in three clusters. The effect was deeply unsettling—like watching something that only resembled a human being.

Movement. Upper right. Hartfield's training kicked in, his rifle swinging toward—

A muzzle flash.

Time seemed to slow. Hartfield saw the extremist emerging from behind a stack of pallets, rifle already aimed, already firing. Saw the muzzle bloom, felt his body starting to react but knowing he was too slow, the round already in flight.

Then LeBouf *moved*.

It wasn't running. It wasn't jumping. It was something else entirely—a burst of motion so fast Hartfield's eyes couldn't track it. One moment LeBouf was five meters away, the next he was directly in front of Hartfield, impossibly fast, accompanied by a sharp *whoosh* of displaced air and a brief flash of blue light from his back.

The round meant for Hartfield's chest hit LeBouf instead.

Sparks erupted from the impact point on LeBouf's torso, a shower of orange-white that lasted a fraction of a second. The bullet deflected with a metallic *ping*, ricocheting off into the warehouse ceiling. LeBouf didn't stagger. Didn't flinch. Just stood there, a wall of angular black armor between Hartfield and the shooter.

Hartfield's training overrode his shock. His M4 was already coming up, muscle memory and fifteen years of experience taking over. Three controlled shots, center mass. The extremist jerked backward and went down.

For a heartbeat, neither man moved.

Then LeBouf turned, that featureless black visor with its twelve red points of light fixing on Hartfield. The lens clusters tracked with mechanical precision, sweeping across Hartfield's face, his body, assessing for damage. The alien quality of that gaze—those glowing red points arranged in three clusters of four—made Hartfield's hindbrain scream warnings about predators and prey.

LeBouf's voice came through the comms, filtered through his helmet but still carrying that French accent. Calm. Almost casual.

> "You are unharmed?"

Hartfield's mouth was dry. He managed a nod, then realized the gesture might not translate through whatever sensors ESF used.

> "I'm good. You—" He gestured at the impact point on LeBouf's chest. "That was a rifle round."

> "The suit is rated for such threats." LeBouf's visor swept the warehouse once more, then returned to Hartfield. "Stay behind cover when possible, Agent. We cannot intercept every shot."

Then he was moving again, flowing back into the fight as if nothing had happened. But Hartfield stood frozen for a moment longer, his mind trying to process what he'd just seen.

The speed. The impossible speed. LeBouf had covered five meters in what couldn't have been more than a tenth of a second. And the suit—the round had hit dead center and just... bounced off. No penetration. No damage. Just sparks and a deflection.

This wasn't advanced body armor. This was something else. Something that made every piece of tactical gear Hartfield had ever used look like medieval equipment by comparison.

> "Hartfield, you good?" Martinez's voice through the comms, concerned.

> "Yeah." Hartfield shook himself, forced his body to move. "I'm good. Clear right and advance."

But his hands were shaking as he gripped his rifle. Not from fear. From the sudden, visceral understanding that ESF wasn't just technologically advanced.

They were operating on a completely different level of capability. A level that made conventional special operations look slow and vulnerable by comparison.

And LeBouf had just taken a bullet meant for him without hesitation.

But the targets were already down.

Marisa watched from her position as the FBI agents swept through the warehouse. Extremists lay scattered across the floor, weapons dropped, most of them clutching their chests or limbs but alive. Conscious, in pain, but alive. The ESF weapons hadn't killed them—just incapacitated them with surgical precision.

All except the man LeBouf had kicked. He was still slumped against the wall, unmoving.

> "Clear left!"

> "Clear right!"

> "Second floor clear!"

The calls came rapid-fire as the FBI team secured the warehouse. Marisa stood from her cover position, rifle still shouldered, and moved toward the entrance. Her legs felt unsteady, her hands still shaking with adrenaline.

Inside the warehouse, the three ESF operators stood in a loose perimeter, their weapons tracking potential threats with mechanical precision. The red glow of their lens clusters swept the space, and Marisa noticed the extremists on the ground were giving those glowing eyes a very wide berth, even in their incapacitated state.

LeBouf's visor was still down, his face hidden behind that smooth black surface with its twelve points of red light. He stood over the man he'd kicked, rifle pointed down but not quite aimed. Checking for consciousness, Marisa realized. Making sure the threat was neutralized.

Hartfield approached LeBouf, his M4 lowered but ready. When he spoke, his voice was carefully controlled.

> "What the hell are those weapons? And how did you—" He gestured at the unconscious extremist. "That's not standard takedown technique."

LeBouf's visor retracted with that same smooth *snap*, revealing his unremarkable face. The transformation back was jarring—from alien predator to forgettable middle manager in an instant. But his eyes were hard, calculating, still carrying the edge of combat readiness.

> "Specialized equipment, as discussed. Non-lethal when possible, highly effective when necessary." His accent was thick now, stress and exertion stripping away the careful neutrality. "Your man is safe. The threats are neutralized. That is what matters."

> "Non-lethal?" Hartfield looked at the extremists scattered across the warehouse floor. "They're all—"

> "Incapacitated but alive," Shade's genderless voice confirmed through the comms. "Kinetic impact rounds. Designed for maximum stopping power with minimal lethality. Broken ribs, severe bruising, possible internal trauma, but survivable. They'll stand trial."

Rodriguez was moving among the downed extremists, checking vitals, securing weapons. He looked up at Hartfield with an expression of disbelief.

> "They're breathing. All of them. Fuck me, they're all breathing."

Marisa stepped fully into the warehouse, her rifle finally lowering. Around her, the FBI team was securing the scene—zip-tying wrists, calling for medical support, documenting the evidence. The extremists groaned and writhed on the floor, conscious enough to feel pain but too hurt to resist.

Twelve armed terrorists. Neutralized in under two minutes. Zero FBI casualties. Zero enemy fatalities.

It shouldn't have been possible. But ESF had made it look routine.

---

The next twenty minutes were a controlled chaos of securing evidence and processing suspects. FBI agents moved through the warehouse with practiced efficiency, photographing the scene, collecting weapons, documenting injuries. Marisa coordinated with local police and federal medical response, arranging transport for the twelve incapacitated extremists. All of them would survive, though several had broken ribs and one—the man LeBouf had kicked—had a severe concussion and possible spinal trauma.

The three ESF operators had withdrawn to the perimeter, standing in loose formation near the loading bay entrance. Their visors were up now, revealing three faces that Marisa was already struggling to remember in detail. LeBouf's unremarkable features. A woman with dark hair and sharp eyes who must be one of the other operators. A man with a forgettable face that seemed to slide out of memory even as Marisa looked at him.

Hartfield was coordinating the evidence collection, his voice steady and professional over the comms, but Marisa had noticed the way he kept glancing at the ESF team. The way his hands occasionally trembled when he thought no one was looking. Whatever had happened inside the warehouse had shaken him.

Rodriguez approached Marisa, his tablet displaying preliminary photos of the seized materials.

> "Agent Comey, you need to see this. We found two partially assembled devices in the back room. High-voltage capacitors, ferrite cores, the whole shopping list from the intelligence package. They were maybe a day away from being operational."

Marisa felt cold relief wash over her. They'd stopped it. They'd actually stopped it. Two devices that could have disabled blocks of infrastructure, that could have killed people through secondary effects—hospitals losing power, traffic systems failing, emergency services blinded.

> "Document everything. I want a complete technical analysis sent to—"

Shade's voice cut through every comm channel simultaneously, sharp and urgent. The genderless tone carried an edge Marisa hadn't heard before.

> "All personnel, priority alert. We have a significant development."

The warehouse went silent. FBI agents paused mid-task. The ESF operators' heads snapped up in unison, a synchronized movement that looked almost mechanical.

> "The cell we just interdicted missed their scheduled check-in seventeen minutes ago. Our monitoring shows the broader network is aware of the raid. Communications intercepts indicate they're accelerating their timeline."

Marisa's stomach dropped.

> "Accelerating how?" Hartfield demanded.

> "Two devices are already operational. Fully assembled, armed, and positioned. The network is moving up their detonation schedule in response to our action here."

> "Where?" Marisa was already moving toward LeBouf, her mind racing through response protocols.

> "San Francisco. Mission District and Financial District. Devices are positioned to maximize infrastructure damage and cascading failures across the city's power grid and communications networks."

> "When?" Hartfield had joined Marisa, his face pale.

> "Fifty-eight minutes. They've initiated the countdown."

The warehouse erupted in controlled chaos. Hartfield was already on his phone, calling FBI San Francisco field office. Rodriguez was pulling up maps on his tablet. Marisa's mind was running calculations, trying to find an angle, any angle that could work.

> "We need to contact San Francisco PD, evacuate the blast radius—"

> "Agent Comey," Shade interrupted. "EMP devices don't have a traditional blast radius. The electromagnetic pulse will propagate through the electrical grid. Evacuation won't help. We need to physically disable the devices before detonation."

Marisa looked at Hartfield. He was thinking the same thing she was—the math didn't work.

> "Even if we left right now," Hartfield said slowly, "took a Bureau charter, flew at maximum speed—we're looking at what, five hours minimum to San Francisco?"

> "Four hours forty minutes if we can get airborne in the next ten minutes," Marisa confirmed. "We'd need clearance, flight plan, coordination with—"

> "We don't have four hours," Hartfield said flatly. "We have fifty-seven minutes."

Marisa's mind raced through alternatives. Military assets? The Air Force had response teams, but the same time constraints applied. Local law enforcement? They could reach the devices, but without technical expertise to disarm EMP weapons, they'd be helpless. Remote detonation of the devices? Too risky—could trigger them early.

> "What about bomb disposal teams in San Francisco?" Rodriguez suggested. "If we can give them technical specs—"

> "These aren't conventional explosives," LeBouf said, approaching the group. His visor was still up, his unremarkable face carrying an expression of calm certainty that felt surreal given the circumstances. "The detonation mechanism is electronic, likely with anti-tamper features. Local teams would need detailed schematics and specialized equipment. We don't have time for that." 

Marisa wanted to scream. They'd done everything right. They'd stopped the cell, seized the devices, prevented the attack. But there were always more cells, more devices, more threats they hadn't seen coming. The network had anticipated interdiction and built in redundancy.

> "There has to be something," she said, hearing the desperation in her own voice. "We can't just—"

> "There is something," LeBouf said quietly.

Everyone turned to look at him. The ESF operator stood with that same patient calm, but now Marisa could see something else in his expression. A hint of anticipation. Perhaps even amusement.

> "We can reach San Francisco in time," LeBouf continued. "But it will require... unconventional transportation."

Hartfield's eyes narrowed.

> "What kind of unconventional?"

LeBouf glanced at the other two ESF operators, who had moved closer. Then he looked back at Marisa and Hartfield, and there was definitely amusement in his unremarkable features now. Something knowing and almost playful.

> "I think," he said, his French accent more pronounced, "it is time you met Shade. In person."

## Chapter 5: Ascent

A slight wind kicked up across the parking lot, swirling debris and causing loose papers to scatter. Marisa felt it first—a change in air pressure, a subtle disturbance that made her ears pop. The sodium lights overhead flickered.

> "Look up," LeBouf said quietly.

Marisa tilted her head back. At first, she saw nothing but the orange-tinted night sky of industrial New Jersey. Then the air *shimmered*.

It started as a distortion, like heat haze on summer asphalt, but wrong—too precise, too geometric. The shimmer spread outward in a shape that shouldn't exist, revealing angular surfaces that caught the light in ways that made her eyes hurt to focus on. Black panels that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. Surfaces that shifted between matte and glossy as if the material itself couldn't decide what it was.

The craft materialized from nothing, settling toward the parking lot with impossible silence. No roar of engines. No downdraft from rotors. Just that gentle wind and the soft *hiss* of something moving through air that didn't want to move.

It was enormous. Fifty meters long at least, shaped like a flattened diamond or an arrowhead, all sharp angles and aggressive geometry. The nose was impossibly sharp, the body flowing back into wings that were too thin, too elegant, breaking every rule of aerodynamics Marisa had ever learned. The entire surface seemed to be made of those light-absorbing panels, broken only by subtle seams and what might have been sensor ports glowing with faint blue light.

The craft touched down on extended landing gear that looked too delicate to support its mass, settling with barely a whisper of contact. A ramp extended from the ventral surface with a soft hydraulic hiss, lowering to the parking lot asphalt. The interior beyond was lit with that same dim blue glow from the sensor ports.

Marisa stood frozen, her mind struggling to process what she was seeing. Beside her, Hartfield had gone pale, his hand unconsciously gripping his rifle tighter.

> "What the fuck," Rodriguez breathed.

LeBouf was already moving toward the craft, his two teammates flanking him. He called back over his shoulder, urgency cutting through his usual calm.

> "Hurry up and board. We have fifty-six minutes, and this is your ticket to San Francisco."

Marisa's feet moved before her brain fully engaged, training and desperation overriding the shock. Hartfield grabbed her arm.

> "Comey, that's not a plane. That's not any aircraft I've ever—"

> "I know," Marisa said, pulling free. "But it's also our only option. Move."

They ran toward the craft, Martinez and Rodriguez following. As they approached, Marisa could see the interior more clearly through the opening. Not a cargo bay or passenger compartment—something else. Seats that looked molded from the same angular material as the exterior, arranged in two rows facing each other. Restraint systems that were far more complex than standard five-point harnesses. Panels covered in what looked like medical equipment.

LeBouf waited at the entrance, literally bouncing on his toes with an energy that was completely at odds with his usual composed demeanor. The moment they were close enough, he started talking, words coming fast, his accent thick with stress.

> "This is Shade. The plane itself *is* Shade. It's an AI—artificial intelligence—fully autonomous. It will be taking us to space and back down to reach San Francisco in just over twenty minutes."

> "Space," Hartfield repeated flatly. "You're saying we're going to *space*."

> "Suborbital trajectory, yes." LeBouf was already climbing into the craft, gesturing for them to follow. "Get in, strap in immediately. We'll provide countermeasures—pressure suits, medications, monitoring—but blacking out is expected and normal. Your bodies are not designed for this kind of acceleration."

Marisa hauled herself through the opening, her hands finding purchase on surfaces that felt warm and almost organic. The interior was cramped despite the craft's size, every centimeter optimized for function. The seats—if they could be called that—were less like furniture and more like form-fitting cocoons.

The other two ESF operators were already strapped in, their visors down, moving with practiced efficiency. LeBouf was helping Martinez into one of the seats, his hands moving rapidly over the complex restraint system.

> "Arms here, legs here, head back against the rest. The system will conform to your body. Do not fight it. Shade will monitor your vitals and provide support as needed."

Marisa dropped into a seat, and immediately the material shifted, flowing around her limbs like liquid becoming solid. Restraints snaked across her chest, her thighs, her shoulders, locking into place with soft *clicks*. A panel extended from the headrest, curving around to position itself in front of her face—a helmet or mask of some kind, already sealing against her skin.

> "Wait—" she started, but the mask was already locked in place, and suddenly she could breathe easier, the air tasting pure and cold.

Shade's voice filled her ears, coming through the mask's integrated speakers with that same measured, genderless tone.

> "Agent Comey. Welcome aboard. Please remain calm. I am monitoring your vitals. Heart rate elevated but acceptable. Beginning pre-flight preparation."

Marisa looked around wildly. Hartfield was in the seat across from her, his eyes wide behind his own mask. Martinez and Rodriguez were further back, both looking terrified. LeBouf was the last to strap in, his movements hurried, almost frantic.

Hartfield's voice came through the comm system, muffled by his mask but clear.

> "LeBouf. Have you done this before? This... whatever this is?"

LeBouf's hands were still shaking as he finished securing his own restraints. When he spoke, his accent was so thick Marisa could barely understand him.

> "Yes. Many times."

> "Then why," Hartfield pressed, his voice tight, "do you look just as anxious as the rest of us?"

LeBouf's unremarkable face turned toward Hartfield, and for once, his expression was completely honest. Raw. Almost haunted.

> "Because you don't get used to it," he said quietly. "It just gets less bad each time."
