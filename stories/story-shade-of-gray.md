# Shade of Gray

## Chapter 1: The Calling Card

Special Agent Marisa Comey had learned to trust her gut over fifteen years at the FBI. That morning, walking through the humid Washington air toward the Hoover Building, her gut told her something was off. Nothing concrete—no missed calls, no emergency alerts—just that nagging itch between her shoulder blades that came before the world tilted sideways.

She swiped her badge at the security checkpoint, nodded to the guard, and took the elevator to the fifth floor where the Technology Crimes Division made its home. The halls were already buzzing with the usual morning energy: agents trading coffee for case files, keyboards clattering, phones ringing. Normal. Everything was normal.

She pushed through the glass door to her office, a modest space with a window overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, and froze.

On her desk, centered with almost surgical precision, sat a business card.

Not tossed casually. Not slipped under her keyboard or left on a stack of papers. Dead center, square to the desk's edges, like someone had measured it. The card was matte black with a logo she didn't recognize: a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, two broken swords crossed saltire beneath it. Clean. Professional. Distinctly *not* government issue.

Marisa circled her desk slowly, studying the card from different angles before touching it. Old habits. She'd worked counterintelligence before moving to tech crimes, and unexplained objects on secured federal property set off alarm bells.

She picked it up. Heavy cardstock, expensive. The logo was embossed, catching the light. On the back, handwritten in neat block letters:

**Referred by Langley. Russian EMP tech/domestic extremists. Call ASAP.**

Below that, a phone number. 202 area code. Washington.

Marisa sat down slowly, still holding the card. Langley meant CIA. But the CIA didn't leave cryptic business cards on FBI desks—they sent encrypted emails or made awkward phone calls through liaison channels. They definitely didn't namecheck themselves on handwritten notes.

She turned the card over again, studying the logo. Something about it triggered a memory, but she couldn't place it. The design was memorable—distinctive enough that she'd have remembered seeing it before, yet she didn't.

Her phone buzzed. Text from her supervisor: *Morning briefing moved to 10. Same conference room.*

Marisa looked at the card again. Russian EMP technology. Domestic extremists. Two things that absolutely belonged on the FBI's radar but hadn't crossed her desk yet. Someone knew something she didn't.

She pulled out her phone and photographed the card, front and back, then texted the images to her personal device. Paranoia, maybe, but operational security had kept her alive more than once.

The phone number stared up at her. Call ASAP.

Marisa checked her watch. 0847. She had an hour before the briefing, and if Langley had referred someone to her—assuming this was legitimate—then it probably mattered. If it wasn't legitimate, she'd find out quickly enough.

She picked up her office phone, hesitated, then set it down. Used her cell instead, putting it on speaker as she pulled her notebook close.

The line rang once. Twice.

> "Good morning, Special Agent Comey."

Marisa's hand froze over her notepad. The voice was professional, measured, masculine with a subtle French accent. And the speaker had identified her without her saying a word.

> "This is Special Agent Comey. Who am I speaking with?"

> "You may call me Jeane LeBouf. I represent an organization that operates in partnership with certain elements of the U.S. intelligence community. We have information regarding a credible threat to national security that falls within your jurisdiction."

Marisa wrote quickly: *Jeane LeBouf. Male, French accent. Partnership w/ intel community. Knows my name/desk.*

> "And which organization would that be?"

> "ESF. You'll find our credentials referenced in classified compartments accessible to you through your DOE Q clearance. We operate primarily in the counter-proliferation space."

Marisa pulled up her classified access terminal, fingers flying over the keys. ESF. The search came back with three documents, all marked COSMIC TOP SECRET with additional caveats she'd never seen before. She didn't have access to open them, but their existence confirmed something was real.

> "I'm seeing references, but I can't access the files."

> "That's expected. Your clearance level permits acknowledgment of our existence but not operational details. What you need to know is this: several months ago, a Russian research facility in Sarov was compromised. Materials relating to electromagnetic pulse weapon development were stolen. Since then, black market movements have indicated components being smuggled into the United States through Eastern Seaboard ports. Our intelligence indicates these materials are now in the hands of a domestic extremist cell."

Marisa's pen stopped moving. EMP weapons. Domestic extremists. This was exactly the kind of nightmare scenario that kept the Bureau's Counterterrorism Division up at night.

> "What kind of extremist cell?"

> "A far-right network. At minimum, a segment of one. They are particularly hostile to LGBTQ+ minorities and believe that triggering infrastructure collapse will catalyze the societal transformation they desire. We assess they're targeting critical infrastructure in a major metropolitan area. The EMP devices they've acquired are crude but functional—sufficient to disable electronics across several city blocks."

> "And you know this how?"

A pause. Brief, but noticeable.

> "We have assets and capabilities beyond traditional intelligence channels. Signals intelligence, human intelligence, technical surveillance. Our methods are unconventional but reliable. The CIA can vouch for our track record, which is why they referred us to you specifically."

Marisa tapped her pen against her notepad. The man's answers were smooth, practiced, but vague enough to avoid giving away operational details. Classic intelligence community behavior.

> "Why the FBI? Why not handle this through CIA or DOD channels?"

> "Because this is a domestic threat on U.S. soil, which makes it Bureau jurisdiction. And because the technical nature of the threat requires your division's expertise. We're not here to circumvent your authority, Agent Comey. We're here to augment it."

> "Augment how?"

> "We offer three things: intelligence analysis, tactical support, and in-field operational assistance. We have a mobile task force positioned to assist with interdiction operations. MTF-34, led by myself, specializes in technology-related threats. We can provide real-time intelligence, electronic warfare support, and tactical intervention if necessary."

MTF-34. Mobile Task Force. Marisa added that to her notes.

> "And what do you want in return?"

> "Coordination. Access to your investigative resources. Liaison authority with your tactical teams. We're not asking to take over your operation, Agent Comey. We're offering to help you succeed."

Marisa leaned back in her chair, studying the business card still sitting on her desk. The logo, the timing, the smoothness of this pitch—it all felt carefully orchestrated. But if the threat was real, if there really were EMP weapons in the hands of domestic terrorists, she couldn't afford to ignore it.

> "I'll need to verify this with my chain of command and with Langley."

> "Of course. Ask for Senior Field Agent Alicia Monroe at CIA. She'll confirm our relationship. Specifically, ask her about Nightingale. In the meantime, we're sending you a preliminary intelligence package. Check your JWICS terminal in the next five minutes."

The line went silent for a moment, and Marisa could hear faint keystrokes in the background.

> "Agent Comey, I understand your caution. But I need you to understand something: we're on a clock. Our assessment indicates the target cell plans to activate their devices within two weeks. Every hour of delay increases the risk of mass casualties."

Marisa's jaw tightened. Two weeks. If this was real, two weeks wasn't enough time for a full investigation, threat assessment, and operational response. They'd need to move fast, cut corners, trust incomplete intelligence.

Exactly the kind of situation that led to disasters.

> "I'll review your package and make some calls. How do I reach you?"

> "The number you called. It's secure. When you're ready to proceed, we'll arrange a face-to-face briefing. There are elements of this situation that can't be discussed over any phone line."

> "Understood."

> "One more thing, Agent Comey." The voice softened slightly, became more personal. "We didn't leave that card on your desk to intimidate you. We left it there to demonstrate that we're serious, that we have capabilities you'll find useful, and that we respect the Bureau's authority enough to come to you directly rather than operating in the shadows. We want to work *with* you, not around you."

Marisa looked at the card again, at the careful placement, the embossed logo, the handwritten note. A demonstration of capability. A calling card, literally.

> "I'll be in touch, Mr. LeBouf."

> "We'll be waiting."

The line went dead.

Marisa sat in silence for a long moment, then swiveled to her classified terminal. The JWICS login screen blinked at her. She entered her credentials, navigated to her secure inbox, and there it was: a new message, timestamped four minutes ago. Subject line: **RUSSIAN EMP PROLIFERATION - THREAT ASSESSMENT**.

Sender: **ESF LIAISON**.

She clicked it open. The document was thorough—thirty pages of intelligence analysis, technical specifications, known associates, geographic indicators, and threat timelines. Photos of shipping manifests, customs documents with annotations, satellite imagery of warehouse facilities in Baltimore and Norfolk. Signal intercepts from cell phones and radios, transcribed and translated.

This wasn't speculative intelligence. This was operational-grade intel, the kind that took months to develop and analyze. And it had been compiled and delivered to her in the time it took to make a phone call.

Marisa scrolled through the document, her unease growing with each page. Everything was too clean, too complete. Either ESF had extraordinary intelligence capabilities, or they'd been tracking this threat for a long time and only now decided to share it.

Or both.

She checked her watch. 0912. Forty-eight minutes until the briefing. She needed to read this entire document, verify what she could, and figure out what to tell her supervisor. And she needed to call Langley.

She reached for her secure phone, then stopped. Her gut was back, that itch between her shoulder blades. The same instinct that had warned her this morning was now screaming a different message:

Whatever was about to happen, it was bigger than EMP weapons and domestic terrorists.

She looked at the business card one more time, at the logo with its crossed broken swords.

*We Are Watching.*

The phrase had been nagging at her, and now she realized why. She'd heard it before, years ago, in a different context. A counterintelligence briefing about unexplained interventions in foreign operations. Mysterious third parties who appeared, resolved situations, and vanished. Always leaving the same calling card.

Marisa picked up the phone and dialed Langley.

Time to find out what was really going on.

---

The CIA's main switchboard answered on the second ring. Marisa identified herself, requested Senior Field Agent Alicia Monroe, and waited through the usual security protocols. A transfer. Hold music. Another transfer. She checked her watch again. 0918.

> "This is Monroe."

The voice was crisp, professional, with an edge that suggested she'd been interrupted in the middle of something important.

> "Ms. Monroe, this is Special Agent Marisa Comey, FBI Technology Crimes Division. I apologize for the cold call, but I need to verify some information."

A pause.

> "Go ahead."

> "I received a contact this morning from someone claiming to represent an organization called ESF. They left a business card on my desk—inside a secured federal building—and have provided detailed intelligence on a domestic terrorism threat. They told me to ask you about them. Specifically, they mentioned something called Nightingale."

The silence on the other end stretched long enough that Marisa wondered if the connection had dropped. Then Monroe spoke, her voice quieter, more measured.

> "Where are you calling from?"

> "My office. FBI headquarters."

> "Secure line?"

> "Yes."

Another pause. Marisa could hear papers rustling, a door closing.

> "All right. What do you want to know?"

> "Are they legitimate? Can I trust their intelligence?"

> "Yes and yes." Monroe's response was immediate, no hesitation. "ESF is... they're real. They've worked with us before. Successfully."

> "Nightingale?"

Monroe exhaled slowly.

> "Nightingale was an asset extraction. Moscow. Last year. It should have been impossible—deep penetration, multiple layers of FSB surveillance, hostile territory. We had no options, no angle, no way to get our guy out without triggering an international incident." She paused. "ESF made it happen. I still don't know how. One day our asset was burned and trapped, the next day he was sitting in a safe house in Prague. Like magic."

Marisa wrote quickly, underlining *Moscow extraction* and *impossible* in her notes.

> "So they're some kind of special operations unit? DOD black budget?"

> "I don't know what they are." Monroe's voice carried a strange mix of frustration and awe. "I've tried to find out. I've pulled every string I have access to, called in favors, dug through archives. There's almost nothing. Just scattered references in old case files, always at the edges. They show up when situations are impossible, they fix them, and they disappear."

> "But you trust them."

> "I don't know a lot myself, despite my contact, but I can tell you this: whatever they promise you, no matter how impossible-sounding or outlandish a promise, it will come true. I don't know how they do it, and frankly I don't think I want to know, but they can do anything."

Marisa stared at the business card on her desk, at the embossed logo that had somehow appeared in her locked office overnight.

> "They've promised tactical support. A mobile task force. Electronic warfare capabilities."

> "Then you'll get it." Monroe's certainty was absolute. "Agent Comey, I'll be honest with you. Whatever operation you're about to run with them, it's going to work. It's going to work in ways that don't make sense, that shouldn't be possible. You're going to see things that will make you question what you know about technology, about logistics, about what's achievable. My advice? Don't ask too many questions. Don't dig too deep. Just let them do what they do and be grateful for the results."

> "That's not how we work. Chain of custody, evidence protocols, operational oversight—"

> "I know." Monroe cut her off gently. "Believe me, I know. But ESF doesn't operate like anyone else. They can't. And if they're coming to you directly, offering cooperation, that means the threat is real and it's serious. They don't show up for small problems."

Marisa looked at the intelligence package on her screen. Thirty pages of perfect intelligence. EMP weapons in the hands of extremists. Two weeks until activation.

> "Can you tell me anything else about them? Leadership? Chain of command? Legal authority?"

> "No. And honestly, I'm not sure anyone can. What I know is operational. They deliver. Every time. That's enough for me."

It wasn't enough for Marisa. Not by a long shot. But she understood what Monroe was saying. Sometimes you had to work with incomplete information. Sometimes you had to trust results over process.

> "If I need to reach you again about this?"

> "Call my direct line. I'll send you the number after we hang up." Monroe paused. "Agent Comey? One more thing. When you meet them—and you will meet them—pay attention. Watch how they work. You might learn something that changes how you think about everything."

> "Like what?"

> "Like what's actually possible in this world."

The line went dead before Marisa could respond.

She sat back in her chair, staring at her notes. Moscow extraction. Impossible situations. Promises that always come true. Technology that shouldn't exist. An organization that operated at the edges of documented history, fixing problems that couldn't be fixed.

Her secure phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number: Monroe's direct line, followed by a brief message.

*Trust them. You won't regret it. —AM*

Marisa looked at her watch. 0927. Thirty-three minutes until the briefing. She pulled up the ESF intelligence package again and started reading in earnest, taking detailed notes on known associates, suspected locations, and tactical vulnerabilities.

If she was going to work with ESF—and it seemed she had little choice—she needed to understand the threat first. The questions about her new partners could wait.

But they wouldn't wait forever.

---

The next thirty minutes passed in a blur of cross-referencing and verification. Marisa pulled up Customs and Border Protection databases, checked shipping manifests against the intelligence package, and ran queries through FinCEN's financial intelligence systems. Every check came back positive. The shipments were real. The companies listed as importers existed but were shell corporations with suspicious ownership structures. The cargo descriptions matched materials that could be used in EMP device construction.

By 0955, she had confirmed enough to make her blood run cold. Over the past two months, at least seven separate shipments had arrived at Baltimore, Norfolk, Philadelphia, and Newark. High-voltage capacitors. Triggered spark gap switches. Ferrite cores. Copper winding. Battery systems capable of rapid discharge. Each shipment innocuous on its own, but together they formed a shopping list for electromagnetic pulse weapons.

The components weren't just enough for one device. They could build several.

Marisa grabbed her tablet, loaded with her notes and key excerpts from the ESF package, and headed for Conference Room 3B. Her supervisor, Assistant Director Nathan Reeves, was already there, along with two other senior agents from the division and a counterterrorism specialist she recognized from the fourth floor.

> "Comey." Reeves nodded as she entered. "You said this was urgent."

> "Sir, we have a credible threat. Domestic terrorism. Multiple EMP devices in the hands of a far-right extremist network."

The room went quiet. Reeves set down his coffee cup with careful precision.

> "Walk us through it."

Marisa connected her tablet to the room's display system and pulled up the first image: the ESF business card, logo clearly visible.

> "At approximately 0845 this morning, I found this on my desk. Inside my locked office. It references a CIA referral and mentions Russian EMP technology and domestic extremists."

> "How did it get inside your office?" The counterterrorism specialist—Agent Marcus Chen—leaned forward, frowning.

> "Unknown. I'm still trying to determine that. But what matters is the intelligence it led to." She advanced to the next screen: excerpts from the ESF package. "The contact provided detailed intelligence on a theft from a Russian research facility in Sarov several months ago. Materials related to electromagnetic pulse weapon development. Since then, black market tracking has indicated components being smuggled into the United States."

She clicked through images of shipping manifests, customs documents, satellite photos of warehouse facilities.

> "In the limited time I had this morning, I ran cross-checks through CBP and FinCEN. Every shipment highlighted in the source material corresponds to real imports. Seven separate deliveries over the past two months to East Coast ports." She paused, making eye contact with each person in the room. "The components match technical specifications for crude but functional EMP devices. Based on the quantities imported, we're looking at the capability to construct at least four, possibly six devices."

Reeves's face had gone pale. Chen was frantically taking notes on his tablet.

> "Target assessment?" Reeves asked, his voice tight.

> "Far-right extremist network with particular hostility toward LGBTQ+ communities. The source assesses they're planning to target critical infrastructure in a major metropolitan area to trigger what they view as catalyzing societal collapse." Marisa advanced to the timeline. "Estimated timeline: two weeks until potential activation."

> "Jesus Christ." The words came from Agent Sarah Kovacs, one of the senior tech crimes investigators. "Do we have locations? Names?"

> "The source material includes partial information on known associates, suspected safe houses, and warehouse facilities. But it's incomplete. The source has offered to provide tactical support and real-time intelligence to assist with interdiction."

> "The source." Reeves fixed her with a sharp look. "Who exactly is this source?"

> "An organization called ESF. They claim to operate in partnership with elements of the intelligence community, specifically CIA. I verified their credentials with a Senior Field Agent at Langley this morning. She confirmed their legitimacy and vouched for their operational effectiveness."

> "ESF." Chen was already typing. "Never heard of them."

> "You wouldn't have. They're compartmented. I found references in classified systems but no accessible files at my clearance level." Marisa took a breath. "Sir, the CIA contact was very clear: ESF has capabilities beyond conventional intelligence and tactical units. She described them as operating at the edges, appearing when situations are impossible, and making things happen that shouldn't be possible."

The room fell silent. Reeves exchanged glances with Chen, then looked back at Marisa.

> "Your assessment? Is this legitimate or some kind of elaborate hoax?"

> "The intelligence is real. I've verified enough of it independently to confirm that. The shipments exist, the materials match, the timeline is plausible. Whether ESF is exactly what they claim to be..." She hesitated. "I can't say for certain. But their capabilities are clearly extraordinary. They accessed a secured federal building overnight, left physical evidence on my desk, and compiled intelligence that would take us months to develop on our own."

Reeves rubbed his face, the weight of the decision visible in every line.

> "If this is real, we're looking at a catastrophic attack. EMP devices in a major city could disable emergency services, hospitals, transportation, communications. Mass casualties from secondary effects alone." He looked around the table. "We can't afford to ignore this. But we also can't afford to be played."

> "Sir," Marisa said carefully, "the CIA contact told me that ESF doesn't show up for small problems. If they're here, offering direct cooperation, the threat is real."

Another silence. Then Reeves made his decision.

> "All right. Comey, you're lead on this. I'm assigning you Ops Suite 7 and giving you clearance to requisition whatever resources you need. You'll coordinate with Chen's counterterrorism team and with tactical units as required." He paused, his jaw tight. "And you're authorized to issue temporary facility badges to your ESF contacts."

Kovacs looked up sharply.

> "Sir, we're giving unknown contractors access to FBI headquarters?"

> "If what Comey says is true, they'll show up whether we invite them or not." Reeves's voice was grim. "This way, we can at least keep an eye on them. And if they can help us stop this threat, we need them." He turned back to Marisa. "But Comey, you watch them. Every move. Every word. I want to know exactly what we're dealing with."

> "Yes, sir."

> "Chen, I want a full briefing packet for the Director within two hours. Kovacs, start pulling everything we have on far-right extremist networks with anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. Cross-reference with anyone who has technical sophistication or access to specialized equipment." He stood. "We have two weeks. Let's move."

The room emptied quickly, agents heading for their stations. Marisa remained for a moment, staring at the business card still displayed on the screen. The wireframe globe. The broken swords. The laurels.

*We Are Watching.*

She pulled out her phone and dialed the number from the card.

It was time to meet her new partners.

## Chapter 2: Outside Assistance

The next morning, Marisa arrived at FBI headquarters at 0730, earlier than usual. She'd spent most of the previous evening coordinating with Chen's counterterrorism team, reviewing threat assessments, and trying not to think too hard about what she was about to invite into her investigation.

She'd called LeBouf the afternoon before. The conversation had been brief, professional. He would arrive at 0900 with credentials and biometrics for temporary badge processing. No mention of how many people would be coming. No details on capabilities or equipment. Just a calm assurance that MTF-34 was ready to assist.

Ops Suite 7 was on the third floor, a secure workspace with dedicated terminals, a conference table, multiple displays, and enough room for a small team. Marisa had already loaded the ESF intelligence package onto the suite's isolated network and set up workstations for cross-referencing and analysis. By 0845, everything was ready.

She stood in the lobby at 0855, watching the security checkpoint. Her phone buzzed: a text from an unknown number.

*Arriving now. —JL*

Thirty seconds later, Jeane LeBouf walked through the main entrance.

He was remarkably unremarkable. Around six-one, but he walked with the slight slouch of someone who spent altogether too much time in front of screens, making him seem shorter than he should be. His hair was lightly graying—not distinguished silver, just the fading that came with age—and his features had a plainness that seemed to deflect attention. His face was the kind you'd struggle to describe five minutes after meeting him: average proportions, forgettable structure, the sort of appearance that made him disappear in a crowd of three.

Marisa tried to place his age from his features and found it almost impossible. The graying suggested forties, maybe early fifties, but his face could have belonged to someone ten years younger or older. He wore an off-the-rack suit in charcoal gray—the kind someone making an average salary might buy to look professional but not ostentatious. The fit was acceptable but not tailored, the fabric serviceable but not expensive.

Everything about him radiated middle management mediocrity. The kind of person you'd shake hands with at a networking event and forget by the time he let go.

Yet he spotted her immediately and crossed the lobby with a quiet efficiency that suggested awareness beyond what his appearance implied.

> "Special Agent Comey. A pleasure to meet you in person."

His handshake was firm but unremarkable, his voice carrying that subtle French accent she'd heard on the phone. Marisa found herself already having trouble fixing his features in memory, as if her brain didn't want to commit the details to long-term storage.

> "Mr. LeBouf. Thank you for coming." She kept her voice neutral, professional. "I'll need to process your credentials and biometrics for a temporary facility badge."

> "Of course." He produced a wallet and extracted a driver's license. Virginia. The photo matched the unremarkable face in front of her.

They processed him through security in silence. Fingerprinting, iris scan, badge photo. The biometric systems took longer than usual, flagging anomalies twice before finally clearing him. Marisa made a mental note of that. When the badge printer finally produced his credential, she handed it over with no small amount of suspicion.

> "This gives you access to the third floor operations area and approved conference rooms. Nowhere else without escort."

> "Understood." LeBouf clipped the badge to his suit jacket. "Shall we?"

They rode the elevator in silence. Marisa studied him peripherally, looking for tells, but found herself struggling to focus on him. He stood quietly, hands loose at his sides, posture slightly hunched. His eyes tracked the floor indicator with the vacant attention of someone accustomed to boring commutes. Nothing about him suggested operator training or tactical awareness. He could have been an IT contractor, a mid-level analyst, an accountant.

Yet when the elevator dinged and the doors opened, he moved aside with perfect spatial awareness, letting her exit first without making it seem deliberate. The gesture was so natural, so unremarkable, that she almost missed how precisely he'd positioned himself to maintain sight lines to both the elevator interior and the hallway beyond.

> "How many team members will be joining us?" she asked as they exited on the third floor.

> "For now, just myself." He followed her down the corridor. "MTF-34 operates with a small footprint. Additional personnel will be deployed only as needed for tactical operations."

> "And your role?"

> "Coordination and intelligence analysis. I serve as the interface between ESF capabilities and your investigative process."

That told her precisely nothing. Marisa keyed them into Ops Suite 7 and gestured to the workstations.

> "I've loaded the intelligence package you provided onto our isolated network. We've confirmed the shipments and begun cross-referencing against known extremist networks. What we need now are the gaps—associates, locations, communication channels."

LeBouf set his tablet on the conference table and pulled out a phone—not a standard smartphone, but something sleeker, with a matte black finish and no visible branding.

> "Before we begin, I should clarify ESF's operational parameters." His tone was measured, almost apologetic. "We operate with certain... restrictions on information sharing. Methodology, sources, specific technical capabilities—these remain compartmented. What I can provide are actionable intelligence products and tactical support. The how and why behind them must remain opaque."

Marisa crossed her arms.

> "That's going to be a problem. Chain of custody, evidence admissibility—"

> "The intelligence we provide will be sufficient for you to develop parallel construction through traditional means." LeBouf's expression was patient. "We identify leads. You verify them through conventional channels. By the time any evidence reaches a courtroom, it will have been obtained through legally defensible methods."

> "Parallel construction." Marisa's voice was flat. "You're asking me to launder intelligence."

> "I'm asking you to save lives." LeBouf met her eyes steadily. "The how of our intelligence gathering would not survive judicial scrutiny. The what of our intelligence is accurate and actionable. We provide the former so you can legitimately obtain the latter. It's not ideal, but it works."

Marisa wanted to argue, to push back against the fundamental wrongness of the approach. But she'd worked counterintelligence. She knew how the game was played when national security trumped procedural purity. And if the threat was real—and her verification suggested it was—then saving lives had to take priority over legal perfectionism.

> "I don't like it," she said finally.

> "Neither do I, Agent Comey. But it's the price of effectiveness." He turned to his tablet. "Shall we begin?"

Over the next hour, they worked through the known shipments, mapping delivery locations to suspected warehouse facilities. Kovacs joined them briefly with a preliminary report on extremist networks, then returned to her own analysis. Chen stopped by twice for updates.

Marisa noticed LeBouf made several phone calls throughout the morning, always stepping away from the main workstations, voice low but audible enough to catch fragments.

> "Cipher, I need signals intercept on the Baltimore warehouse... yes, any activity in the last seventy-two hours..."

Ten minutes later:

> "Shade, can you pull traffic camera footage for the Newark facility? I need vehicle identification..."

When he returned from the second call, Marisa couldn't help herself.

> "Cipher and Shade. Your team members?"

LeBouf's expression remained neutral.

> "Outside assistance. They provide specialized support for certain technical requirements."

> "What kind of specialized support?"

> "The kind that allows us to move quickly." He tapped his tablet, pulling up a new screen. "Speaking of which, I have a potential lead on the Newark shipment. There's a warehouse in Elizabeth registered to a company called Patriot Logistics. Shell corporation, same ownership structure as the importers. No legitimate business activity, but utility records show power consumption consistent with climate control and security systems."

Marisa pulled up the business registry. He was right—the ownership chain led back to the same network of LLCs that had received the shipments.

> "How did you identify this?"

> "Cross-referencing corporate structures against utility databases, property records, and financial transactions." LeBouf's tone suggested he was reciting a script. "Standard investigative work."

It wasn't standard. That kind of analysis would take days, not minutes. But Marisa let it slide. For now.

By 1300, they'd identified three high-priority locations across two states. Each matched the profile: shell company ownership, suspicious utility patterns, proximity to the shipment delivery points. LeBouf made another call, this one even more cryptic.

> "Cipher, I need confirmation on the Elizabeth warehouse. Any signals activity... right, check encrypted traffic too, anything that doesn't match normal patterns..."

When he returned, he had a new piece of information.

> "The Elizabeth location shows suspicious wireless traffic. Encrypted burst transmissions at irregular intervals, consistent with security systems or remote monitoring. Worth surveillance."

Marisa stared at him.

> "You identified wireless traffic patterns at a specific location in the last five minutes."

> "My colleague has access to specialized monitoring equipment."

> "What kind of monitoring equipment?"

> "The effective kind." LeBouf's expression remained maddeningly calm. "Agent Comey, I understand your frustration. But the capabilities I'm describing—while unconventional—are within the technical realm of possibility. We simply have resources and authorizations that allow us to move faster than traditional investigative processes."

It was a polite way of saying shut up and accept the results. Marisa didn't like it, but she couldn't argue with the effectiveness. In six hours, they'd developed more leads than her team would have generated in a week.

---

The pattern continued over the next three days.

Each morning, LeBouf arrived precisely at 0900, badged in with the same forgettable efficiency, and spent the day working alongside Marisa's team in Ops Suite 7. He had a remarkable ability to fade into the background—sitting at a workstation, typing quietly, occasionally making notes on his tablet. Other agents would walk past him without seeming to register his presence. Twice, Marisa watched Kovacs enter the suite, look around as if searching for someone, then leave without acknowledging LeBouf despite him sitting in plain view.

He was professional, focused, and consistently productive. He also made an unsettling number of phone calls to his mysterious "outside assistance," always stepping into the hallway where his unremarkable presence would draw even less attention.

On day two, they hit a dead end tracking one of the shell companies. The ownership chain disappeared into a maze of offshore entities, and conventional database queries yielded nothing. LeBouf excused himself, stepped into the hallway, and had a brief conversation with someone he addressed as Cipher.

Fifteen minutes later, he returned with a complete breakdown of the ownership structure, including the names of the actual beneficial owners buried under six layers of LLCs and Panamanian holding companies.

> "How did you get this?" Marisa demanded, staring at the document on his tablet.

> "Financial intelligence analysis. My colleague has access to certain international banking records."

> "The kind of access that requires subpoenas and international cooperation agreements?"

> "The kind of access that produces results." LeBouf's tone remained patient. "Agent Comey, would you prefer to wait three weeks for the proper paperwork, or would you prefer to verify this information through parallel investigation and move forward with the operation?"

She chose the latter. She wasn't proud of it.

Day three brought another impossibility. They'd identified a suspected safe house in Maryland but had no concrete evidence of occupation or activity. LeBouf made another call to Shade, speaking in rapid French that Marisa's high school education couldn't quite follow. When he returned, he pulled up a series of images on his tablet.

> "Ring doorbell camera from a house two doors down, traffic camera at the intersection, and a Tesla's dashcam from a vehicle that parked nearby yesterday." He swiped through the images, each showing the same two individuals entering and leaving the safe house at various times. "Facial recognition matches two of the known associates from the initial intelligence package."

Marisa looked at the timestamps. The images had been captured over the past forty-eight hours. The Tesla footage was from a camera that shouldn't be accessible without the owner's permission. The Ring camera required either a warrant or voluntary cooperation. The traffic camera needed city authorization.

LeBouf had obtained all of it in under twenty minutes.

> "Your colleague hacked into private security cameras and vehicle systems."

LeBouf's expression didn't change.

> "My colleague accessed publicly visible recording devices through legally ambiguous but technically achievable means. The footage exists. Whether it's admissible in court is irrelevant if it allows you to develop probable cause through traditional surveillance."

> "That's not how the law works—"

> "That's exactly how operational reality works." For the first time, LeBouf's calm cracked slightly. "Agent Comey, we have eleven days until these devices potentially activate. Eleven days to identify locations, map networks, and interdict a distributed terror cell. I can get you the intelligence you need to do that, but I cannot get it through methods that satisfy your legal comfort. So you have a choice: accept the intelligence and use it to build a parallel case, or maintain procedural purity while people die. Which would you prefer?"

The silence stretched between them. Marisa knew he was right. Hated that he was right. But couldn't argue with the logic.

> "Show me the footage," she said finally.

By the end of day three, they'd identified six priority locations, compiled dossiers on eight suspected network members, and established a preliminary movement pattern that suggested coordination between cells. Every piece of intelligence had come from LeBouf's mysterious contacts—Cipher and Shade, whose capabilities seemed to extend into every digital system in the modern world.

Late that afternoon, Marisa stood at the Ops Suite window, watching LeBouf make yet another call in the hallway. His voice drifted through the partially open door.

> "Shade, I need the Signal message history for this number... yes, I know it's encrypted, that's why I'm asking you..."

Marisa felt her stomach drop. Signal was end-to-end encrypted. Breaking that encryption was supposed to be impossible without physical access to the device. Even the NSA couldn't do it reliably. Yet LeBouf spoke as if it were a trivial request.

When he returned, he had transcripts.

> "Encrypted Signal messages between two of the known associates. They're discussing a meeting tomorrow in Philadelphia. Location is coded, but context suggests the warehouse we identified on Tacony Street."

Marisa stared at the transcripts. They were real—the metadata, the timestamps, the message structure all matched Signal's format.

> "You broke Signal encryption."

> "My colleague accessed endpoint data through alternative means." LeBouf's expression gave nothing away. "The how is irrelevant. The what is actionable."

Alternative means. Endpoint access. The euphemisms piled up, each one a polite fiction covering capabilities that shouldn't exist. Marisa thought about the CIA agent's words: *they can do anything.* It was starting to feel less like hyperbole and more like understatement.

That evening, after LeBouf had left for the day, Marisa sat alone in Ops Suite 7, staring at the digital evidence board they'd constructed. Every lead, every connection, every piece of critical intelligence had come from phone calls to Cipher and Shade. Not from traditional investigative work. Not from legal surveillance. From two individuals whose capabilities suggested access to—

She stopped the thought before completing it. Access to *what*, exactly? Ring cameras and traffic feeds could be explained through hacking, though the speed was suspicious. Financial records might involve leaked databases or compromised banking systems. But Signal encryption? Endpoint access suggested either physical compromise of the devices or capabilities that bordered on science fiction.

Marisa pulled up the case file and began documenting their progress, carefully crafting each entry to focus on results rather than methodology. Parallel construction, as LeBouf had called it. Intelligence laundering, as she thought of it.

She looked at the evidence board again, at the web of connections they'd built in just three days. Locations identified. Networks mapped. Communications intercepted. A terror cell that should have taken months to penetrate, laid bare in seventy-two hours.

Alicia Monroe's words echoed in her mind: *whatever they promise you, no matter how impossible-sounding or outlandish a promise, it will come true.*

Marisa was beginning to understand what that really meant. ESF didn't just have better resources or faster access. They had capabilities that implied something far more disturbing: either they'd achieved surveillance technology decades ahead of anything she'd seen, or they had access to systems and networks that weren't supposed to be accessible at all.

Cipher and Shade weren't just outside assistance. They were apparently inside *everything*.

---

The rest of the week became a methodical dismantling of the network, piece by piece.

By Thursday, they'd identified twelve members of the extremist cell, tracked seven vehicles, and pinpointed four operational warehouses. Each day brought new breakthroughs that would have been impossible without LeBouf's mysterious contacts. A bank transaction here, a cell phone ping there, a fragment of intercepted communication that led to the next thread. FBI surveillance teams moved into position around the Maryland safe house and the Philadelphia warehouse, confirming what ESF's intelligence had predicted: coordinated activity, regular movements, suspicious deliveries.

Marisa coordinated with Chen's counterterrorism team, feeding them sanitized intelligence that could be officially attributed to traditional investigative methods. They obtained proper warrants based on "anonymous tips" that happened to align perfectly with LeBouf's illegally-acquired intelligence. The parallel construction was working, slowly building a case that would survive judicial scrutiny even as it depended entirely on capabilities that shouldn't exist.

On Friday morning, they made their first arrests. Two network members in Baltimore, caught loading equipment into a van under FBI surveillance. The search warrant—obtained through proper channels after LeBouf had identified the location—turned up high-voltage capacitors and battery systems. Not enough for a complete device, but enough to charge both men with conspiracy.

Marisa watched the arrest through drone footage in Ops Suite 7, feeling the satisfaction of a successful operation tempered by the knowledge of how they'd really gotten there. LeBouf stood beside her, his unremarkable face showing no emotion as federal agents handcuffed the suspects.

> "Two down," she said quietly. "Ten to go. Plus however many we haven't identified yet."

> "Progress." LeBouf's tone was neutral. "But we're running out of time. They'll know we're closing in. Smart operators go to ground when associates start disappearing."

He was right. By Friday afternoon, the intercepted communications had shifted. More coded language. Shorter messages. Signs of operational security tightening.

That evening, LeBouf stepped out for another call to Cipher. When he returned fifteen minutes later, his unremarkable features carried a hint of tension that Marisa had learned to recognize as concern.

> "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

> "What kind of problem?"

> "Cipher's monitoring shows the network is accelerating their timeline. Chatter suggests they're aware of our pressure and moving up their schedule." He pulled up his tablet, displaying a series of intercepted messages. "There's another shipment expected. Final components for at least two more devices."

Marisa leaned over the display, scanning the intelligence. The messages were fragments, coded references that would mean nothing to anyone who didn't already know what they were looking for.

> "When?"

> "Tomorrow evening. Saturday. Newark docks, berth thirty-seven." LeBouf's fingers moved across the tablet, pulling up satellite imagery. "Container ship arriving from Hamburg via Rotterdam. One of their front companies has a legitimate import scheduled—industrial electronics. Perfect cover for the real cargo."

> "Tomorrow." Marisa checked her watch. Friday, 1845. "That gives us less than twenty-four hours to plan an interdiction."

> "Yes. And if we miss it, they'll have everything they need to complete multiple devices. Possibly activate within days rather than the original timeline." LeBouf met her eyes. "This is the moment, Agent Comey. We either stop them at the docks or we're chasing them through a much more dangerous endgame."

Marisa pulled out her phone and dialed Chen. He answered on the second ring.

> "Chen, I need a tactical team. Newark docks, tomorrow evening. Priority operation."

A pause on the other end.

> "What's the target?"

> "Final shipment for the EMP devices. We interdict at the docks or they go dark with everything they need." She looked at LeBouf, who nodded confirmation. "I need HRT assets. Full tactical package."

> "HRT's deployed in Seattle on another operation. I can get you Agent Hartfield's team. They're based out of Quantico, specialist in urban assault and high-risk interdiction. Good people."

Marisa had heard of James Hartfield. Former Special Forces, recruited to the FBI's elite tactical units, known for precise operations in complex environments. If Chen was recommending him, that was enough.

> "Get him. I'll brief him tonight. Operation goes at whatever time that container ship docks."

> "Understood. I'll have him at headquarters by 2000."

The line went dead. Marisa turned back to LeBouf.

> "Your people. MTF-34. Will they be there?"

LeBouf's expression shifted slightly—not quite a smile, but something close to satisfaction.

> "Yes. The rest of the team will meet us at the Newark docks tomorrow evening. They'll provide tactical support and electronic warfare coverage." He paused. "Agent Comey, I should warn you: this will be the first time you see ESF operate in the field. It will be... different from conventional law enforcement operations."

> "Different how?"

> "Different in ways that will answer some of your questions about our capabilities. And likely raise many more."

Alicia Monroe's words came back to her: *You're going to see things that will make you question what you know about technology, about logistics, about what's achievable.*

Marisa had a feeling tomorrow night would be exactly what Monroe had warned her about.

---

Agent James Hartfield arrived at FBI headquarters precisely at 2000, accompanied by three members of his tactical team. He was tall, maybe six-three, with the build and bearing of someone who'd spent a career in violent professions. His handshake was firm, his eyes sharp, and within five minutes of entering Ops Suite 7, he'd assessed every exit, sight line, and potential threat vector in the room.

Marisa walked him through the intelligence: the network, the shipments, the accelerated timeline, and the planned interdiction. Hartfield listened without interrupting, occasionally making notes on his tablet.

LeBouf sat in the background, unremarkable and easily overlooked, until Marisa introduced him.

> "This is Jeane LeBouf. He represents ESF, a partner organization that's been providing intelligence support. His team will be joining us at the docks for tactical support."

Hartfield's eyes flicked to LeBouf, then back to Marisa. Something in his expression suggested he was reserving judgment.

> "ESF. Not familiar with that designation."

> "Compartmented," Marisa said, using the explanation that had become routine. "They operate in partnership with intelligence community elements. Specialized capabilities."

> "What kind of specialized capabilities?"

LeBouf spoke before Marisa could respond, his voice carrying its usual patient neutrality.

> "Electronic warfare, signals intelligence, tactical coordination. MTF-34 specializes in technology-focused threat interdiction. We'll provide overwatch and technical support while your team handles the direct action."

Hartfield nodded slowly, but Marisa could see he was filing away questions for later.

They spent the next two hours planning the operation. The container ship was scheduled to dock at 2145. The target container would be offloaded by 2300. Hartfield's team would establish positions covering the berth, ready to move when the extremist cell arrived to collect their cargo. LeBouf would coordinate with MTF-34 for electronic surveillance and communications intercept.

By 2200, they had a plan. By 2230, Hartfield and his team had departed to prepare. By 2300, Marisa was alone in Ops Suite 7, staring at satellite imagery of the Newark docks and trying not to think about what "different from conventional law enforcement operations" might actually mean.

Her phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number—LeBouf's secure device.

*MTF-34 will be in position by 2100 tomorrow. You'll recognize us when you see us. —JL*

Marisa stared at the message. *You'll recognize us when you see us.* That should have been reassuring. Instead, it sent a chill down her spine.

She thought about the past week. The impossible intelligence. The capabilities that shouldn't exist. Cipher and Shade with their fingers in every network and device. LeBouf's calm certainty that whatever ESF promised would come true.

Tomorrow night, she'd finally see what ESF could actually do in the field.

She pulled up Alicia Monroe's contact information and stared at it for a long moment before finally calling.

Monroe answered on the third ring.

> "Agent Comey. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again."

> "Tomorrow night. Newark docks. We're interdicting the final shipment. ESF is sending their tactical team."

A long pause.

> "So you're about to see them work."

> "Yes. LeBouf said it would be different from conventional operations."

> "He's not wrong." Monroe's voice carried something Marisa couldn't quite identify. Not quite amusement, not quite warning. "Agent Comey, remember what I told you. Whatever you see tomorrow, don't ask too many questions. Just let them do what they do."

> "That's not very reassuring."

> "It's not meant to be. It's meant to be practical." Monroe paused. "Good luck. You're going to need it. Not because the operation will fail—it won't. But because after tomorrow night, you're going to understand why some questions shouldn't be asked."

The line went dead.

Marisa sat in the empty ops suite, surrounded by screens showing intelligence that shouldn't exist, planning an operation with partners whose capabilities defied explanation.

She thought about Hartfield and his team, preparing for what they assumed would be a conventional tactical operation. She thought about LeBouf with his unremarkable face and his remarkable contacts. She thought about MTF-34, whoever and whatever they were, preparing to deploy to the Newark docks.

*You're going to see things that will make you question what you know about technology, about logistics, about what's achievable.*

Marisa had a feeling that by tomorrow night, she and Hartfield would both understand exactly what Alicia Monroe had been trying to warn them about.

## Chapter 3: Recognition

The staging area was an empty warehouse two blocks from the Newark docks, condemned and forgotten, perfect for a covert operation. Hartfield's team arrived first at 2030, parking their unmarked vehicles in the loading bay and conducting a methodical sweep of the perimeter. By the time Marisa pulled up in her Bureau sedan at 2045, they'd already established a secure perimeter and set up a mobile command post.

Hartfield met her at the door, dressed in full tactical gear. Body armor over black fatigues, helmet with integrated communications, rifle held with the casual competence of someone who'd carried weapons for most of his adult life. His three team members were similarly equipped, moving through final equipment checks with practiced efficiency.

> "Agent Comey." Hartfield's nod was professional, his eyes scanning the street behind her. "Your ESF contacts haven't arrived yet."

> "They will." Marisa checked her watch. 2047. "LeBouf said they'd be in position by 2100."

> "About that." Hartfield gestured toward the makeshift command post—a folding table with laptops, radios, and tactical displays. "I'd like to coordinate our movement with theirs before we deploy. Standard procedure when working with... outside elements."

The pause before "outside elements" suggested he had questions. Marisa couldn't blame him.

They were reviewing the operational timeline when headlights swept across the warehouse entrance. A grey minivan, completely unremarkable, the kind of vehicle that blended into any parking lot in America. It pulled into the loading bay with careful precision, parking beside Hartfield's tactical vehicles.

For a moment, nobody moved. Then the van's side door slid open.

The first figure that emerged made Marisa's breath catch.

The man wore a black bodysuit overlaid with angular panels that caught the dim warehouse light in strange ways, seeming to shift and flow as he moved. The panels weren't quite rigid, weren't quite flexible, but something in between that suggested technology she didn't recognize. The helmet was integrated seamlessly with the suit, no visible seam where neck met collar, its shape angular and almost alien with subtle indentations and protrusions that suggested sensors or equipment she couldn't identify. Three clusters of small lenses were mounted on the helmet's face—four lenses per cluster, arranged vertically—glowing a dim, unsettling red. Two clusters sat where eyes might be on a human face, the third centered above them. With LeBouf's visor retracted, these lens clusters were dark and inert, pushed to the sides of his helmet.

But his visor was retracted, and Marisa recognized the unremarkable face beneath the helmet.

LeBouf.

Except everything else about him had changed. The slouch was gone. He moved with fluid, predatory efficiency, weight balanced on the balls of his feet, every gesture precise and economical. His eyes swept the warehouse with systematic awareness, cataloging threats and angles with the automatic competence of someone who'd survived situations far worse than a dockside interdiction. The middle-management mediocrity had vanished, replaced by something that made Marisa's hindbrain recognize a dangerous predator.

Two more figures followed him out of the van, identically equipped. Their visors were down, rendering their faces invisible behind smooth black surfaces, and on these operators the lens clusters glowed with that same dim red light—twelve small points arranged in three groups of four, giving them an insect-like, almost alien appearance. They moved with the same unsettling precision, fluid and coordinated, as if every gesture had been calculated for maximum efficiency.

Beside her, Marisa heard Hartfield's sharp intake of breath.

The three ESF operators approached, and she could hear it now: a faint humming sound emanating from their equipment. Even without seeing their eyes behind the visors, she could feel their gaze on her and Hartfield's team—methodical, assessing, aware of everything. Not quite electrical, not quite mechanical, but something that made the air feel charged. The sound raised the hairs on her arms.

Each of them carried rifles that were wrong in ways Marisa's eyes struggled to process. They were sleek and angular like the armor, but the proportions were off. The barrels were too thin, barely wider than her thumb, and they hummed with the same unsettling frequency as the suits. No visible magazines, no ejection ports, no iron sights—just smooth surfaces and subtle glowing indicators that pulsed with a soft blue light.

One of Hartfield's team members—a veteran tactical officer named Rodriguez—took an involuntary step back. Even Hartfield's posture had shifted slightly, the subtle tensing of someone whose combat instincts were screaming warning.

LeBouf stopped a respectful distance away, but there was nothing deferential in his stance. He stood like someone completely in control of any battlefield, ready for anything, the kind of operator who'd walked out of situations that should have been fatal. His unremarkable face seemed almost jarring now, a forgettable mask on something far more dangerous.

> "Agent Comey. Agent Hartfield." His voice was the same patient, accented tone she'd heard all week. "MTF-34 is ready to support your operation."

Hartfield found his voice first, though it carried an edge Marisa hadn't heard before.

> "What the hell am I looking at?"

LeBouf's expression didn't change.

> "Specialized tactical equipment. As I mentioned, we operate differently from conventional law enforcement."

> "That gear—" Hartfield gestured at the suits, the helmets, the impossible rifles. "I've never seen anything like it. Not in the military, not in any tactical unit I've worked with. What is it?"

> "Effective." LeBouf's tone suggested the question was expected but wouldn't be answered. He reached into a pouch on his suit and produced four small devices, each no larger than a hearing aid. "For your team. Encrypted communications. They'll help you stay in touch better when things are loud."

Hartfield took the devices, examining them with a trained eye. They were sleek, seamless, with no visible buttons or controls. Just smooth black surfaces with a faint blue glow at one end.

> "These aren't standard FBI comms."

> "No. They're better." LeBouf gestured to his helmet. "We'll coordinate through these. Range is effectively unlimited within the operational area, encryption is unbreakable, and they'll automatically filter and prioritize relevant communications. Put them in, press the blue end to activate."

Hartfield distributed the devices to his team, but Marisa could see the questions building behind his eyes. The way he held the earpiece, turned it over in his hand, suggested he was cataloging everything wrong with the situation.

One of the ESF operators—Marisa couldn't tell which was which with the visors down—spoke for the first time. The voice was filtered through the helmet, slightly distorted but clear.

> "We have full tactical overview established. Network surveillance active. Target container is being offloaded now, berth thirty-seven as predicted."

The voice was feminine, calm, with an accent Marisa couldn't quite place.

> "And the targets?" LeBouf asked.

> "Two vehicles en route. ETA fourteen minutes. Three individuals confirmed in lead vehicle, two in trailing vehicle." A pause. "All five match profiles from the intelligence package. This is the pickup team."

Marisa's eyes widened. They'd been on site for what, five minutes? And they already had real-time surveillance of both the container and the incoming vehicles?

> "How did you—" she started.

LeBouf interrupted gently.

> "We have access to certain monitoring capabilities. The details aren't important. What matters is that we have fourteen minutes to get into position before the targets arrive."

Hartfield's jaw was tight, but he nodded slowly.

> "All right. My team moves to positions alpha through delta, covering all approaches to the berth. Your team—" he paused, clearly struggling with what to call them, "—provides overwatch and electronic support as discussed."

> "Agreed." LeBouf's tone carried quiet authority. "We'll be in position within three minutes. You'll have full communications coverage and tactical data feed through the earpieces."

The three ESF operators turned and moved back toward the van with that same unsettling fluid precision. As they walked away, LeBouf gave a slight nod, and the two halves of his visor slid together in front of his face with a soft snap, sealing seamlessly without a visible seam. The lens clusters on either side of his helmet came to life, twelve small points of dim red light now matching his teammates', transforming him from a forgettable man in advanced gear into something far more alien.

Marisa watched them go, trying to process what she'd just seen. The way LeBouf moved now, the casual readiness in his stance—it was like watching a different person wearing the same forgettable face.

Hartfield stepped closer to her, his voice low.

> "Agent Comey, I need you to tell me what the hell we're working with here. That equipment—it's not military surplus, it's not experimental tech I've heard about, it's not anything that should exist."

> "I don't know," Marisa admitted. The honesty felt necessary. "I've been working with LeBouf all week. He's been providing intelligence through... unconventional means. But this is the first time I've seen them operate in the field."

> "That gear looks like something out of a DARPA fever dream. Twenty years ahead of anything I've seen." He looked at the earpiece in his hand. "And these things are telling me they have real-time vehicle tracking on targets fourteen minutes out. That's not surveillance, Comey. That's something else."

Marisa thought about the past week. Cipher and Shade with access to every network and device. Signal encryption broken like it was nothing. Intelligence that appeared in minutes instead of months. LeBouf's calm certainty that whatever ESF promised would come true.

Monroe had tried to warn her. She was seeing it now. And it was worse than she'd imagined.

> "I know," she said quietly. "But right now, we need them. Those targets will be here in thirteen minutes, and we need to stop this shipment. Whatever questions we have about ESF—they wait until after the operation."

Hartfield stared at her for a long moment, then nodded grimly.

> "After the operation, you and I are having a very long conversation about who the hell we're working with."

He turned to his team, voice shifting to command mode.

> "All right, listen up. Insert these comms. We move in two minutes. Positions alpha through delta as briefed. Rules of engagement: observe, identify, detain. No shots unless absolutely necessary. Our partners will provide overwatch and electronic support."

He paused, looking at the earpieces.

> "And whatever you see or hear from the ESF team tonight—you keep it to yourselves until we debrief. Clear?"

A chorus of acknowledgments. Professional, disciplined, but Marisa could see the unease in their eyes. They'd all seen the gear, heard the humming, felt the wrongness of it.

She inserted her own earpiece, pressing the blue end as LeBouf had instructed. For a moment, nothing. Then a soft tone, and suddenly the world opened up.

Voices in crystal clarity, layered but distinct. Hartfield coordinating with his team. The filtered helmet voice of one of the ESF operators providing updates. And underneath it all, a faint background hum that felt like standing next to a power transformer.

Then a new voice, calm and precise, speaking directly into her ear. The voice was strangely genderless, neither masculine nor feminine, with a measured cadence that was somehow deeply reassuring. The kind of voice you'd want in your ear during a firefight.

> "Agent Comey, this is Shade. I'm providing tactical coordination for this operation. Your earpiece is now linked to our tactical network. You'll receive real-time updates on target positions, environmental conditions, and relevant intelligence."

Marisa's blood ran cold. Shade. One of the mysterious contacts who'd been providing LeBouf with impossible intelligence all week. Not a person in an office somewhere, but here, now, speaking directly into her ear.

> "Where are you?" she asked quietly.

> "Providing support." The genderless voice carried a hint of something that might have been amusement. "You'll see us soon enough. For now, focus on the operation. Targets are twelve minutes out."

Marisa looked toward the warehouse entrance, where Hartfield's team was preparing to deploy. The grey minivan sat empty now, the ESF operators already gone.

Somewhere out there, in the maze of shipping containers and industrial equipment surrounding the Newark docks, three figures in impossible gear were moving into position.

And Marisa had a sinking feeling that what she'd seen so far was just the beginning.

## Chapter 4: Overwatch

The Newark docks at night were a landscape of shadows and harsh sodium lights, industrial geometry stretched across acres of concrete and steel. Shipping containers stacked four high created artificial canyons, their corrugated walls painted in faded reds, blues, and rusts. Overhead cranes loomed like mechanical dinosaurs, their skeletal frames silhouetted against the orange glow of the city beyond.

Marisa crouched behind a stack of pallets two hundred meters from the target warehouse, watching Hartfield's team move into position through the thermal optic mounted on her borrowed rifle. The weapon felt foreign in her hands—she was an investigator, not a tactical operator—but Hartfield had insisted she be armed and equipped like the rest of the team.

Through her earpiece, she could hear the steady rhythm of operational communications. Hartfield's voice, calm and professional, directing his team to their positions. Rodriguez acknowledging from position Alpha, covering the warehouse's north entrance. Two other agents—Martinez and Chen—reporting from positions Beta and Gamma, establishing overlapping fields of fire.

And underneath it all, that strange background hum from the ESF communications system, like standing near high-voltage lines.

> "All positions, this is Hartfield. Sound off when in position."

One by one, the FBI agents confirmed. Marisa watched through her optic as they settled into cover, professional and practiced. Good positioning, good spacing, proper security. Everything by the book.

Then Shade's genderless voice cut through the channel, and Marisa felt her stomach tighten.

> "Overwatch established. We have full visual coverage of the operational area. Targets are nine minutes out, proceeding as predicted."

> "Overwatch, Hartfield. What's your position?"

A pause, and Marisa could almost hear the smile in Shade's voice.

> "Where we need to be, Agent Hartfield. You'll see us if the situation requires it. Until then, focus on your team. We'll guide you in."

Hartfield's jaw must have been tight, but his voice remained professional.

> "Copy that. All positions, standby for further guidance."

Marisa scanned the surrounding area, looking for any sign of the ESF operators. The lens clusters, the distinctive helmets, the impossible gear—they should have been visible somewhere in this industrial maze. But there was nothing. Just shadows and shipping containers and the distant rumble of trucks on the highway.

> "Agent Comey," Shade said, speaking directly to her now. "We're tracking your position. You're exposed on your eastern flank. Recommend moving three meters left, behind the concrete barrier. There's a sightline from the warehouse's second-floor window that could compromise you."

Marisa looked left. There was indeed a concrete barrier, waist-high, providing better cover. And when she glanced at the warehouse, she could see the window Shade had mentioned—currently dark, but a potential threat vector.

She moved, settling behind the barrier. Through her earpiece, she heard what might have been approval.

> "Better. You're learning."

> "Overwatch, Rodriguez." The tactical officer's voice carried a note of confusion. "How are you tracking our positions? I don't see any drones, no aerial assets."

> "We have other methods, Agent Rodriguez. Trust that we see what we need to see."

> "That's not an answer—"

> "Rodriguez, Hartfield. Stay focused on the mission."

But Marisa had heard the edge in Rodriguez's voice. She understood it. The idea that ESF could track their positions, see their movements, without any visible surveillance platform was unsettling in ways that went beyond operational security.

The minutes ticked by. Through her earpiece, she heard Shade providing a steady stream of updates. The target vehicles were seven minutes out. Six minutes. Five. Each update came with precise timing, as if ESF had access to GPS tracking on the extremists' vehicles.

Which, Marisa realized with growing unease, they probably did.

> "All positions, Shade. Targets are three minutes out. First vehicle is a white Ford F-150, license plate Jersey Tango-Seven-Three-Charlie-Hotel-Niner. Three occupants, all male, mid-twenties to early thirties. Second vehicle is a grey Dodge Ram, Jersey Bravo-Four-Two-Echo-Kilo-Eight. Two occupants, both male, similar age range."

Marisa pulled up the intelligence package on her phone, cross-referencing the descriptions. The vehicle details matched known associates. So did the physical descriptions Shade was providing.

> "How are you getting these details?" Hartfield's voice was carefully neutral, but Marisa could hear the questions underneath. "Visual confirmation requires line of sight."

> "We have line of sight, Agent Hartfield. Among other things."

Marisa's eyes swept the dockyard again. Where the hell were they? The ESF operators had to be somewhere, had to have positioned themselves for visual observation. But there was nothing. No movement, no signatures, no indication of three operators in advanced tactical gear.

Unless they were somewhere she couldn't see. Somewhere with elevation and clear sightlines. She tilted her head back, looking at the massive container cranes overhead.

There. On one of the crane platforms, maybe sixty meters up, she caught the briefest glint of light reflecting off angular surfaces. A figure, barely visible against the night sky, rendered almost invisible by the darkness and the angle. As she watched, the figure shifted slightly, and she saw the faint red glow of lens clusters.

One of the ESF operators. Perched on a crane platform like some kind of predatory bird.

She keyed her mic.

> "Overwatch, this is Comey. I have visual on one of your operators. North crane, upper platform."

> "Confirmed. That's Dozer. He has primary overwatch from that position."

> "How did he get up there? Those cranes have security locks, no access without—"

> "Agent Comey, respectfully, the how is less important than the results. Dozer has optimal sightlines from that position. Focus on your sector."

Marisa's hands tightened on her rifle. The casual dismissal, the implication that questions were unwelcome—it grated against everything she'd learned about proper operational procedure. But Monroe's words echoed in her head. *Don't ask too many questions. Just let them do what they do.*

The next two minutes passed in tense silence. Marisa could see the other FBI positions now, her eyes adjusting to the industrial darkness. Rodriguez was fifty meters to her left, pressed against a shipping container with his rifle trained on the warehouse entrance. Martinez held the southern approach, barely visible behind a forklift. Hartfield had positioned himself near the main access road, ready to call the move when the time came.

Movement caught Marisa's eye. High above, atop the container stacks. A figure in black, moving with fluid precision across the corrugated metal surface. One of the ESF operators. Even from this distance, she could see the smooth, predatory grace of the movement—no wasted motion, no sound carrying down to ground level. The operator paused at the edge of one stack, then leaped.

For a moment, the figure was airborne, silhouetted against the sodium lights. Then a brief pulse of dim blue light from their back—so faint Marisa almost missed it—and the operator's trajectory shifted mid-air, carrying them smoothly to the next container stack eight feet away. They landed without a sound, without any visible impact, immediately flowing into a low crouch and continuing forward.

Marisa's breath caught. That wasn't human. Humans didn't jump like that, didn't land like that, didn't move with that kind of impossible silence while wearing tactical gear and carrying weapons.

> "Did anyone else just see—" Rodriguez's voice, barely a whisper.

> "Saw it," Martinez confirmed. "How the hell did they—"

> "Focus," Hartfield cut in, but Marisa heard the edge in his voice. He'd seen it too.

Another figure appeared on the containers, this one closer to Rodriguez's position. The ESF operator moved at what should have been a full sprint, but made no sound. Not the clang of boots on metal, not the rustle of equipment, nothing. Just smooth, efficient movement that covered ground faster than seemed physically possible. The red glow of their lens clusters swept the area in methodical patterns, and Marisa found herself holding her breath when that alien gaze passed over her position.

> "Targets are ninety seconds out," Shade announced. "All positions maintain coverage. We're detecting additional heat signatures inside the warehouse. Revising count upward."

> "How many?" Hartfield's voice was sharp.

> "Twelve total. All armed. Weapons consistent with AR-pattern rifles. They're staged in three groups—four near the loading bay, five in the main floor area, three on the second floor providing overwatch."

Marisa's blood ran cold. Twelve armed extremists. The intel had suggested five, maybe six. But twelve changed everything. Changed the tactical balance, changed the risk assessment, changed whether this operation should proceed at all.

> "Overwatch, Hartfield. That's a significant revision from our intelligence. Confidence level?"

> "High confidence. We have thermal, electromagnetic, and acoustic signatures. Twelve individuals, all carrying metal-framed weapons, all positioned as described."

> "How the hell—" Rodriguez started, then caught himself. "Never mind. Not the time."

But Marisa heard what he'd almost said. The question they were all thinking. How could ESF have thermal imaging, electromagnetic detection, and acoustic sensors capable of distinguishing individual weapons from this distance? That would require equipment that didn't exist outside classified military programs. Equipment that certainly shouldn't be in the hands of a shadowy organization operating on U.S. soil.

Through her earpiece, she heard Hartfield making rapid calculations.

> "All positions, be advised we're facing a larger force than anticipated. Maintain position. We proceed only if we can maintain tactical advantage. Overwatch, what's your assessment?"

> "Proceed," Shade said without hesitation. "We have clear sightlines on all twelve targets. If engagement becomes necessary, we can provide suppression and direction. Your team maintains the arrest authority. We're here to ensure you don't get killed in the process."

The bluntness was almost refreshing. At least ESF wasn't pretending this was a standard operation.

> "Copy that," Hartfield said. "All positions, weapons tight unless I give the word. This is a law enforcement operation. We detain, we don't engage unless absolutely necessary."

Hartfield shifted his position, moving to get a better angle on the warehouse entrance. As he did, he caught movement in his peripheral vision. One of the ESF operators, pressed against the corner of a shipping container thirty meters away. The figure moved with that same unnatural silence, bringing their rifle up in a smooth motion.

But instead of quick-peeking around the corner like any trained operator would, the ESF agent extended just the barrel of their weapon around the edge, keeping their body in cover. They held it there for several seconds, the rifle angled as if they were looking through the optic. Then they pulled back, adjusted position, and flowed around the corner with the absolute certainty of someone who'd already seen what was waiting.

Hartfield's jaw tightened. The rifle. They were seeing through the rifle somehow. Getting a visual feed from sensors or cameras mounted on the weapon itself, letting them observe without exposing themselves to return fire. He filed the observation away with all the other impossible things he'd seen tonight. Questions for later. Much later.

Marisa watched the access road. Headlights appeared in the distance, two sets, approaching at moderate speed. No rush, no indication they suspected anything wrong. The white F-150 led, the grey Dodge Ram following twenty meters behind.

Her finger rested alongside the trigger guard, not on the trigger itself. Bureau training. Don't touch the trigger until you're ready to shoot.

> "Targets entering the kill zone," Shade announced. "First vehicle slowing. Driver is scanning the area. Passenger is on a phone—wait, ending the call. They're pulling up to the loading bay."

The F-150 came to a stop thirty meters from Marisa's position. She had a clear view through her optic. Three men, just as Shade had described. The driver killed the engine. Nobody moved for a moment.

Then Rodriguez's voice, barely a whisper through the comms.

> "Jesus Christ. It's like they can see where people are *looking*, not just where they are."

Marisa's head snapped around. Rodriguez had shifted position slightly, just a few inches, probably to get a better angle on the second vehicle. An unconscious tactical adjustment. But she'd heard the wonder in his voice. How the hell had ESF known he needed to adjust before he'd even done it?

Movement to her right. Close. Too close. An ESF operator materialized from the shadows between containers, moving parallel to her position. The figure ran in complete silence, covering ground in long, loping strides that should have made noise, should have clanged against metal surfaces, should have *announced* their presence. But there was nothing. Just the faint hum of their equipment and the dim red glow of lens clusters sweeping the area with mechanical precision.

The operator passed within ten meters of her position, and Marisa got a clear view. The way they moved was wrong in ways that made her hindbrain scream warnings. Too smooth, too efficient, like watching a predator that had evolved for a hundred million years longer than humanity. Every motion flowed into the next with perfect economy, no wasted energy, no hesitation. And through it all, that complete, absolute silence.

Then the figure was gone, disappearing into the maze of containers as if they'd never existed.

Marisa's hands were shaking. She forced them still, forced herself to focus on the warehouse, on the mission. But the image stayed with her. The smooth, inhuman efficiency. The silence. The sense that she was watching something that shouldn't exist outside of nightmares or science fiction.

A new voice cut through the channel. Male, deep, with a faint accent Marisa couldn't place. Not Shade. Not LeBouf. One of the other ESF operators.

> "Dozer here. Affirmative, Agent Rodriguez. Our systems track ocular direction and attention focus. We can see what you're looking at, where your attention is directed. Helps us coordinate movements and prevent friendly fire."

The casual confirmation sent a chill down Marisa's spine. Track ocular direction. Attention focus. That implied sensors capable of detecting eye movement, pupil dilation, maybe even neural activity patterns through their helmets and equipment. Technology that made every science fiction movie she'd ever seen look conservative.

Rodriguez's voice came back, carefully controlled but carrying an edge of disbelief.

> "That's... that's not possible. Not with any technology I know about."

> "Fortunate, then, that you have access to technology you don't know about." Dozer's tone was matter-of-fact, almost amused. "Second vehicle stopping now. All occupants are armed. Two with concealed carry, three with rifles in the truck beds. The man exiting the passenger side of the F-150 has his hand near his waistband. Weapon is a Glock 19, loaded, one in the chamber."

Marisa watched through her optic as the man Dozer described stepped out of the truck. Young, maybe twenty-six, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. His right hand hovered near his belt, fingers twitching. She couldn't see the weapon from this angle, but she didn't doubt it was there.

Because ESF could apparently see through clothing now. Or detect metal signatures. Or read body language with inhuman precision.

Or all of the above.

> "Overwatch, Hartfield. Continue tracking. All positions, standby. We move when all targets are out of their vehicles and committed to entering the warehouse."

The five men from the trucks gathered near the loading bay door, talking in low voices. Through the enhanced audio in her earpiece—another capability she hadn't known the ESF comms possessed—Marisa could hear fragments of conversation.

"—should be ready by now—"

"—Marcus said they finished the second unit—"

"—move everything tonight, get it staged—"

The loading bay door rolled up with a grinding metallic sound. Light spilled out, illuminating the five men. Behind them, inside the warehouse, Marisa could see movement. More figures. The twelve Shade had counted.

> "All targets are now consolidated," Shade said. "Warehouse interior shows three on the upper level, nine on the main floor. Optimal time for interdiction is when the exterior team enters the building. Spacing will separate them from the main group for approximately thirty seconds. Agent Hartfield, recommend you initiate on my mark."

Hartfield's voice was steady, professional.

> "Copy that. All positions, prepare to move on my mark. Remember, this is an arrest operation. Verbal commands first, force only if necessary."

Marisa shifted her weight, readying herself. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Fifteen years with the Bureau, and she'd never been in a tactical operation like this. Never had to move on armed suspects with this kind of tactical complexity.

The five men from the trucks stepped through the loading bay entrance, disappearing into the warehouse interior. Through the open door, Marisa could see them greeting the others inside. Handshakes. Casual conversation. Men who thought they were safe, who had no idea federal agents were closing in.

> "Exterior team is inside," Shade announced. "Separation is optimal. Three seconds. Two. One. Mark."

> "All positions, move now," Hartfield commanded. "FBI! Nobody move!"

Marisa broke from cover, rifle up, moving toward the loading bay entrance. Around her, the other FBI agents converged on the warehouse from multiple angles. Hartfield led from the front, his voice cutting through the night.

> "Federal agents! Hands in the air! Down on the ground!"

Shouts erupted from inside the warehouse. Confusion. Panic. Men scrambling for weapons, for cover, for any kind of response to the sudden assault.

Marisa was twenty meters from the entrance when Martinez stumbled.

It happened fast. His boot caught on something—a piece of debris, a length of chain, something in the darkness—and he went down hard. His rifle clattered against concrete, the metallic sound echoing across the dockyard like a gunshot.

LeBouf's voice cut through the comms instantly, sharp and clear. The calm patience was gone, replaced by something harder. The accent was more pronounced now, the word snapping out with barely contained urgency.

> "Merde. Go loud."

The night exploded.

Gunfire erupted from inside the warehouse. The sharp crack of rifles, muzzle flashes strobing through the loading bay entrance. Someone inside had seen Martinez fall, heard the clatter of his weapon, and made the logical calculation. The extremists were shooting first.

Hartfield's voice cut through the chaos, edged with controlled urgency.

> "Contact! Weapons free! Suppress and advance!"

The FBI agents opened up, controlled three-round bursts from their M4s. The familiar *crack-crack-crack* of rifle fire echoed across the dockyard, punctuated by the metallic *ting* of brass hitting concrete. Marisa pressed herself against her concrete pillar, her hands shaking, her mind racing. Martinez was still exposed, still crawling, rounds kicking up sparks and concrete chips around him.

Then the ESF weapons joined the fight.

The sound was wrong. Not the sharp report of conventional firearms, not even the suppressed *crack* of subsonic rounds through a silencer. Instead, a rapid *zwip-zwip-zwip*—the sound of something very small moving very, very fast. Like a high-speed nail gun crossed with a camera shutter, each shot barely audible over the chaos but somehow cutting through it.

Marisa's head snapped toward the source. One of the ESF operators—she couldn't tell which—had taken a position atop a shipping container thirty meters away. The figure stood in full view, completely exposed, rifle shouldered with mechanical precision. The weapon pulsed with that strange *zwip* sound in rapid succession, and through the warehouse entrance, Marisa saw extremists dropping.

Not wounded. Dropped. Clean, instant incapacitations. A man bringing his rifle to bear on Martinez jerked backward, his weapon clattering away. Another extremist, moving toward the loading bay door, crumpled mid-stride. A third, half-visible behind a pallet, simply collapsed.

No blood spray. No dramatic reactions. Just immediate, clinical neutralization.

> "Second floor shooters neutralized," came a filtered voice—not Shade, not LeBouf. The third operator. "Upstairs is clear."

Marisa looked up. Through the warehouse's second-floor windows, she could see figures slumped against walls, weapons dropped. The second ESF operator had taken them all out in seconds, firing from somewhere she still couldn't see. The *zwip-zwip-zwip* of their weapon had been nearly drowned out by the FBI's M4s, but the results were undeniable.

> "Martinez, move!" Rodriguez shouted. "Go, go, go!"

Martinez scrambled to his feet, sprinting for cover as the FBI team maintained suppressing fire. He made it behind a concrete barrier, breathing hard, and immediately brought his rifle back up.

Then LeBouf moved.

Marisa caught the motion in her peripheral vision—a figure launching from the top of a container stack. Not jumping. *Launching*. That same brief pulse of dim blue light from his back, and suddenly he was airborne, arcing toward the warehouse entrance in a trajectory that physics shouldn't allow.

He covered twenty meters in the air, clearing the FBI positions entirely, and came down just inside the loading bay entrance with impossible precision. The impact should have shattered his ankles, should have sent him sprawling. Instead, he landed in a perfect crouch, absorbed the force without a sound, and immediately flowed into motion.

An extremist emerged from behind a stack of crates, rifle swinging toward LeBouf. The ESF operator was faster. He pivoted, and his leg came up in a forward kick that looked almost lazy in its execution but moved with blinding speed.

The kick caught the extremist square in the chest.

The man *flew*. Not stumbled, not staggered—flew. His body lifted completely off the ground and sailed backward a good eight feet before slamming into the concrete wall behind him with a sickening *crack*. He crumpled, unconscious before he hit the floor, his rifle spinning away across the warehouse floor.

Marisa's mouth fell open. That wasn't human strength. That was hydraulic power, mechanical force, something augmented and amplified beyond anything biology could produce. The casual efficiency of it—the way LeBouf had barely seemed to exert himself—made it even more terrifying.

> "Jesus Christ," Rodriguez breathed over the comms. "What the hell was that?"

LeBouf didn't pause. He flowed forward into the warehouse, his rifle coming up. The *zwip-zwip-zwip* of his weapon joined the other ESF operators, each shot precise and measured. More extremists dropped. Marisa could see them through the entrance now, trying to mount a defense, trying to return fire, but ESF was everywhere and nowhere, moving faster than the extremists could track.

Hartfield's voice cut through, professional instincts overriding his shock.

> "All positions, advance! Martinez, Rodriguez, take the left flank. Chen, with me on the right. Agent Comey, provide cover from your position."

The FBI team moved, training and discipline pushing them forward despite the surreal nature of what they were witnessing. They flowed through the loading bay entrance in textbook formation, weapons up, calling out targets and sectors.

Hartfield entered first, Martinez covering his six. The warehouse interior was chaos—scattered crates, fallen extremists, the acrid smell of gunpowder mixing with something else, something sharp and metallic that Hartfield couldn't identify. He moved tactically, clearing corners, his M4 tracking potential threats.

LeBouf was ahead of him, maybe fifteen feet, moving through the space with that same fluid efficiency. His visor was down now, the smooth black faceplate broken only by those twelve points of red light arranged in three clusters. The effect was deeply unsettling—like watching something that only resembled a human being.

Movement. Upper right. Hartfield's training kicked in, his rifle swinging toward—

A muzzle flash.

Time seemed to slow. Hartfield saw the extremist emerging from behind a stack of pallets, rifle already aimed, already firing. Saw the muzzle bloom, felt his body starting to react but knowing he was too slow, the round already in flight.

Then LeBouf *moved*.

It wasn't running. It wasn't jumping. It was something else entirely—a burst of motion so fast Hartfield's eyes couldn't track it. One moment LeBouf was five meters away, the next he was directly in front of Hartfield, impossibly fast, accompanied by a sharp *whoosh* of displaced air and a brief flash of blue light from his back.

The round meant for Hartfield's chest hit LeBouf instead.

Sparks erupted from the impact point on LeBouf's torso, a shower of orange-white that lasted a fraction of a second. The bullet deflected with a metallic *ping*, ricocheting off into the warehouse ceiling. LeBouf didn't stagger. Didn't flinch. Just stood there, a wall of angular black armor between Hartfield and the shooter.

Hartfield's training overrode his shock. His M4 was already coming up, muscle memory and fifteen years of experience taking over. Three controlled shots, center mass. The extremist jerked backward and went down.

For a heartbeat, neither man moved.

Then LeBouf turned, that featureless black visor with its twelve red points of light fixing on Hartfield. The lens clusters tracked with mechanical precision, sweeping across Hartfield's face, his body, assessing for damage. The alien quality of that gaze—those glowing red points arranged in three clusters of four—made Hartfield's hindbrain scream warnings about predators and prey.

LeBouf's voice came through the comms, filtered through his helmet but still carrying that French accent. Calm. Almost casual.

> "You are unharmed?"

Hartfield's mouth was dry. He managed a nod, then realized the gesture might not translate through whatever sensors ESF used.

> "I'm good. You—" He gestured at the impact point on LeBouf's chest. "That was a rifle round."

> "The suit is rated for such threats." LeBouf's visor swept the warehouse once more, then returned to Hartfield. "Stay behind cover when possible, Agent. We cannot intercept every shot."

Then he was moving again, flowing back into the fight as if nothing had happened. But Hartfield stood frozen for a moment longer, his mind trying to process what he'd just seen.

The speed. The impossible speed. LeBouf had covered five meters in what couldn't have been more than a tenth of a second. And the suit—the round had hit dead center and just... bounced off. No penetration. No damage. Just sparks and a deflection.

This wasn't advanced body armor. This was something else. Something that made every piece of tactical gear Hartfield had ever used look like medieval equipment by comparison.

> "Hartfield, you good?" Martinez's voice through the comms, concerned.

> "Yeah." Hartfield shook himself, forced his body to move. "I'm good. Clear right and advance."

But his hands were shaking as he gripped his rifle. Not from fear. From the sudden, visceral understanding that ESF wasn't just technologically advanced.

They were operating on a completely different level of capability. A level that made conventional special operations look slow and vulnerable by comparison.

And LeBouf had just taken a bullet meant for him without hesitation.

But the targets were already down.

Marisa watched from her position as the FBI agents swept through the warehouse. Extremists lay scattered across the floor, weapons dropped, most of them clutching their chests or limbs but alive. Conscious, in pain, but alive. The ESF weapons hadn't killed them—just incapacitated them with surgical precision.

All except the man LeBouf had kicked. He was still slumped against the wall, unmoving.

> "Clear left!"

> "Clear right!"

> "Second floor clear!"

The calls came rapid-fire as the FBI team secured the warehouse. Marisa stood from her cover position, rifle still shouldered, and moved toward the entrance. Her legs felt unsteady, her hands still shaking with adrenaline.

Inside the warehouse, the three ESF operators stood in a loose perimeter, their weapons tracking potential threats with mechanical precision. The red glow of their lens clusters swept the space, and Marisa noticed the extremists on the ground were giving those glowing eyes a very wide berth, even in their incapacitated state.

LeBouf's visor was still down, his face hidden behind that smooth black surface with its twelve points of red light. He stood over the man he'd kicked, rifle pointed down but not quite aimed. Checking for consciousness, Marisa realized. Making sure the threat was neutralized.

Hartfield approached LeBouf, his M4 lowered but ready. When he spoke, his voice was carefully controlled.

> "What the hell are those weapons? And how did you—" He gestured at the unconscious extremist. "That's not standard takedown technique."

LeBouf's visor retracted with that same smooth *snap*, revealing his unremarkable face. The transformation back was jarring—from alien predator to forgettable middle manager in an instant. But his eyes were hard, calculating, still carrying the edge of combat readiness.

> "Specialized equipment, as discussed. Non-lethal when possible, highly effective when necessary." His accent was thick now, stress and exertion stripping away the careful neutrality. "Your man is safe. The threats are neutralized. That is what matters."

> "Non-lethal?" Hartfield looked at the extremists scattered across the warehouse floor. "They're all—"

> "Incapacitated but alive," Shade's genderless voice confirmed through the comms. "Kinetic impact rounds. Designed for maximum stopping power with minimal lethality. Broken ribs, severe bruising, possible internal trauma, but survivable. They'll stand trial."

Rodriguez was moving among the downed extremists, checking vitals, securing weapons. He looked up at Hartfield with an expression of disbelief.

> "They're breathing. All of them. Fuck me, they're all breathing."

Marisa stepped fully into the warehouse, her rifle finally lowering. Around her, the FBI team was securing the scene—zip-tying wrists, calling for medical support, documenting the evidence. The extremists groaned and writhed on the floor, conscious enough to feel pain but too hurt to resist.

Twelve armed terrorists. Neutralized in under two minutes. Zero FBI casualties. Zero enemy fatalities.

It shouldn't have been possible. But ESF had made it look routine.

---

The next twenty minutes were a controlled chaos of securing evidence and processing suspects. FBI agents moved through the warehouse with practiced efficiency, photographing the scene, collecting weapons, documenting injuries. Marisa coordinated with local police and federal medical response, arranging transport for the twelve incapacitated extremists. All of them would survive, though several had broken ribs and one—the man LeBouf had kicked—had a severe concussion and possible spinal trauma.

The three ESF operators had withdrawn to the perimeter, standing in loose formation near the loading bay entrance. Their visors were up now, revealing three faces that Marisa was already struggling to remember in detail. LeBouf's unremarkable features. A woman with dark hair and sharp eyes who must be one of the other operators. A man with a forgettable face that seemed to slide out of memory even as Marisa looked at him.

Hartfield was coordinating the evidence collection, his voice steady and professional over the comms, but Marisa had noticed the way he kept glancing at the ESF team. The way his hands occasionally trembled when he thought no one was looking. Whatever had happened inside the warehouse had shaken him.

Rodriguez approached Marisa, his tablet displaying preliminary photos of the seized materials.

> "Agent Comey, you need to see this. We found two partially assembled devices in the back room. High-voltage capacitors, ferrite cores, the whole shopping list from the intelligence package. They were maybe a day away from being operational."

Marisa felt cold relief wash over her. They'd stopped it. They'd actually stopped it. Two devices that could have disabled blocks of infrastructure, that could have killed people through secondary effects—hospitals losing power, traffic systems failing, emergency services blinded.

> "Document everything. I want a complete technical analysis sent to—"

Shade's voice cut through every comm channel simultaneously, sharp and urgent. The genderless tone carried an edge Marisa hadn't heard before.

> "All personnel, priority alert. We have a significant development."

The warehouse went silent. FBI agents paused mid-task. The ESF operators' heads snapped up in unison, a synchronized movement that looked almost mechanical.

> "The cell we just interdicted missed their scheduled check-in seventeen minutes ago. Our monitoring shows the broader network is aware of the raid. Communications intercepts indicate they're accelerating their timeline."

Marisa's stomach dropped.

> "Accelerating how?" Hartfield demanded.

> "Two devices are already operational. Fully assembled, armed, and positioned. The network is moving up their detonation schedule in response to our action here."

> "Where?" Marisa was already moving toward LeBouf, her mind racing through response protocols.

> "San Francisco. Mission District and Financial District. Devices are positioned to maximize infrastructure damage and cascading failures across the city's power grid and communications networks."

> "When?" Hartfield had joined Marisa, his face pale.

> "Fifty-eight minutes. They've initiated the countdown."

The warehouse erupted in controlled chaos. Hartfield was already on his phone, calling FBI San Francisco field office. Rodriguez was pulling up maps on his tablet. Marisa's mind was running calculations, trying to find an angle, any angle that could work.

> "We need to contact San Francisco PD, evacuate the blast radius—"

> "Agent Comey," Shade interrupted. "EMP devices don't have a traditional blast radius. The electromagnetic pulse will propagate through the electrical grid. Evacuation won't help. We need to physically disable the devices before detonation."

Marisa looked at Hartfield. He was thinking the same thing she was—the math didn't work.

> "Even if we left right now," Hartfield said slowly, "took a Bureau charter, flew at maximum speed—we're looking at what, five hours minimum to San Francisco?"

> "Four hours forty minutes if we can get airborne in the next ten minutes," Marisa confirmed. "We'd need clearance, flight plan, coordination with—"

> "We don't have four hours," Hartfield said flatly. "We have fifty-seven minutes."

Marisa's mind raced through alternatives. Military assets? The Air Force had response teams, but the same time constraints applied. Local law enforcement? They could reach the devices, but without technical expertise to disarm EMP weapons, they'd be helpless. Remote detonation of the devices? Too risky—could trigger them early.

> "What about bomb disposal teams in San Francisco?" Rodriguez suggested. "If we can give them technical specs—"

> "These aren't conventional explosives," LeBouf said, approaching the group. His visor was still up, his unremarkable face carrying an expression of calm certainty that felt surreal given the circumstances. "The detonation mechanism is electronic, likely with anti-tamper features. Local teams would need detailed schematics and specialized equipment. We don't have time for that." 

Marisa wanted to scream. They'd done everything right. They'd stopped the cell, seized the devices, prevented the attack. But there were always more cells, more devices, more threats they hadn't seen coming. The network had anticipated interdiction and built in redundancy.

> "There has to be something," she said, hearing the desperation in her own voice. "We can't just—"

> "There is something," LeBouf said quietly.

Everyone turned to look at him. The ESF operator stood with that same patient calm, but now Marisa could see something else in his expression. A hint of anticipation. Perhaps even amusement.

> "We can reach San Francisco in time," LeBouf continued. "But it will require... unconventional transportation."

Hartfield's eyes narrowed.

> "What kind of unconventional?"

LeBouf glanced at the other two ESF operators, who had moved closer. Then he looked back at Marisa and Hartfield, and there was definitely amusement in his unremarkable features now. Something knowing and almost playful.

> "I think," he said, his French accent more pronounced, "it is time you met Shade. In person."

## Chapter 5: Ascent

A slight wind kicked up across the parking lot, swirling debris and causing loose papers to scatter. Marisa felt it first—a change in air pressure, a subtle disturbance that made her ears pop. The sodium lights overhead flickered.

> "Look up," LeBouf said quietly.

Marisa tilted her head back. At first, she saw nothing but the orange-tinted night sky of industrial New Jersey. Then the air *shimmered*.

It started as a distortion, like heat haze on summer asphalt, but wrong—too precise, too geometric. The shimmer spread outward in a shape that shouldn't exist, revealing angular surfaces that caught the light in ways that made her eyes hurt to focus on. Black panels that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. Surfaces that shifted between matte and glossy as if the material itself couldn't decide what it was.

The craft materialized from nothing, settling toward the parking lot with impossible silence. No roar of engines. No downdraft from rotors. Just that gentle wind and the soft *hiss* of something moving through air that didn't want to move.

It was enormous. Fifty meters long at least, shaped like a flattened diamond or an arrowhead, all sharp angles and aggressive geometry. The nose was impossibly sharp, the body flowing back into wings that were too thin, too elegant, breaking every rule of aerodynamics Marisa had ever learned. The entire surface seemed to be made of those light-absorbing panels, broken only by subtle seams and what might have been sensor ports glowing with faint blue light.

The craft touched down on extended landing gear that looked too delicate to support its mass, settling with barely a whisper of contact. A ramp extended from the ventral surface with a soft hydraulic hiss, lowering to the parking lot asphalt. The interior beyond was lit with that same dim blue glow from the sensor ports.

Marisa stood frozen, her mind struggling to process what she was seeing. Beside her, Hartfield had gone pale, his hand unconsciously gripping his rifle tighter.

> "What the fuck," Rodriguez breathed.

LeBouf was already moving toward the craft, his two teammates flanking him. He called back over his shoulder, urgency cutting through his usual calm.

> "Hurry up and board. We have fifty-six minutes, and this is your ticket to San Francisco."

Marisa's feet moved before her brain fully engaged, training and desperation overriding the shock. Hartfield grabbed her arm.

> "Comey, that's not a plane. That's not any aircraft I've ever—"

> "I know," Marisa said, pulling free. "But it's also our only option. Move."

They ran toward the craft, Martinez and Rodriguez following. As they approached, Marisa could see the interior more clearly through the opening. Not a cargo bay or passenger compartment—something else. Seats that looked molded from the same angular material as the exterior, arranged in two rows facing each other. Restraint systems that were far more complex than standard five-point harnesses. Panels covered in what looked like medical equipment.

LeBouf waited at the entrance, literally bouncing on his toes with an energy that was completely at odds with his usual composed demeanor. The moment they were close enough, he started talking, words coming fast, his accent thick with stress.

> "This is Shade. The plane itself *is* Shade. It's an AI—artificial intelligence—fully autonomous. It will be taking us to space and back down to reach San Francisco in just over twenty minutes."

> "Space," Hartfield repeated flatly. "You're saying we're going to *space*."

> "Suborbital trajectory, yes." LeBouf was already climbing into the craft, gesturing for them to follow. "Get in, strap in immediately. We'll provide countermeasures—pressure suits, medications, monitoring—but blacking out is expected and normal. Your bodies are not designed for this kind of acceleration."

Marisa hauled herself through the opening, her hands finding purchase on surfaces that felt warm and almost organic. The interior was cramped despite the craft's size, every centimeter optimized for function. The seats—if they could be called that—were less like furniture and more like form-fitting cocoons.

The other two ESF operators were already strapped in, their visors down, moving with practiced efficiency. LeBouf was helping Martinez into one of the seats, his hands moving rapidly over the complex restraint system.

> "Arms here, legs here, head back against the rest. The system will conform to your body. Do not fight it. Shade will monitor your vitals and provide support as needed."

Marisa dropped into a seat, and immediately the material shifted, flowing around her limbs like liquid becoming solid. Restraints snaked across her chest, her thighs, her shoulders, locking into place with soft *clicks*. A panel extended from the headrest, curving around to position itself in front of her face—a helmet or mask of some kind, already sealing against her skin.

> "Wait—" she started, but the mask was already locked in place, and suddenly she could breathe easier, the air tasting pure and cold.

Shade's voice filled her ears, coming through the mask's integrated speakers with that same measured, genderless tone.

> "Agent Comey. Welcome aboard. Please remain calm. I am monitoring your vitals. Heart rate elevated but acceptable. Beginning pre-flight preparation."

Marisa looked around wildly. Hartfield was in the seat across from her, his eyes wide behind his own mask. Martinez and Rodriguez were further back, both looking terrified. LeBouf was the last to strap in, his movements hurried, almost frantic.

Hartfield's voice came through the comm system, muffled by his mask but clear.

> "LeBouf. Have you done this before? This... whatever this is?"

LeBouf's hands were still shaking as he finished securing his own restraints. When he spoke, his accent was so thick Marisa could barely understand him.

> "Yes. Many times."

> "Then why," Hartfield pressed, his voice tight, "do you look just as anxious as the rest of us?"

LeBouf's unremarkable face turned toward Hartfield, and for once, his expression was completely honest. Raw. Almost haunted.

> "Because you don't get used to it," he said quietly. "It just gets less bad each time."

The ramp retracted with a soft hydraulic hiss, sealing into the hull with a final, definitive *snap*. The interior lighting shifted from white to a dim red. Marisa felt the craft shudder—not mechanically, but as if it were a living thing preparing to move.

Shade's voice returned, calm and precise.

> "All personnel secured. Systems nominal. Filing emergency flight plan with FAA. Cloaking system active. Initiating launch sequence."

> "Wait—" Marisa tried to say, but her voice came out as barely a whisper.

> "Launch in five seconds," Shade announced. "Four. Three. Two. One."

> "Merde," LeBouf breathed.

The world disappeared.

---

It wasn't like takeoff. It wasn't like anything Marisa had ever experienced.

The acceleration hit like a physical blow, slamming her back into the seat with a force that emptied her lungs in a single, involuntary gasp. Her vision immediately tunneled, the red-lit interior collapsing to a pinpoint of light surrounded by darkness. The pressure wasn't just on her chest—it was everywhere, crushing down on every square inch of her body as if the air itself had turned solid.

She tried to breathe and couldn't. Her chest wouldn't expand. The mask pumped pure oxygen into her lungs, forcing air past the weight pressing down on her ribs, but it wasn't enough. Her heart hammered against the acceleration, struggling to push blood upward against gravity that had tripled, quadrupled, multiplied beyond anything human bodies were meant to endure.

Through the narrowing tunnel of her vision, she saw Hartfield. His face was distorted, skin pulled back against his skull by the g-forces, lips peeled away from his teeth in an involuntary grimace. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, bulging slightly from the pressure. He was trying to say something, but no sound came out—or if it did, Marisa couldn't hear it over the roar of blood in her ears.

Martinez was worse. The younger agent's head had lolled to one side despite the restraints, his face ashen, veins standing out in stark relief against his neck. His eyes had already rolled back, whites showing.

Across from her, LeBouf looked like he was dying. His jaw was clenched so tight she could see the muscles standing out like cables, his breathing coming in sharp, desperate gasps through his mask. But his eyes were open, focused, locked on something only he could see. This wasn't his first time, she realized. He knew exactly how bad it was going to get.

Shade's voice cut through the pressure, clinical and detached.

> "Maximum acceleration. Seven point four gravities. Duration: forty-two seconds. All vitals in acceptable ranges. Maintain position."

Seven point four gravities. Marisa's mind tried to process that and failed. She weighed—what?—a thousand pounds now? More? Her arms were pinned to the armrests, too heavy to lift. Her head pressed back into the headrest so hard she thought her skull might crack.

Then her veins caught fire.

It started in her arms, a sensation like ice water and molten metal injected simultaneously into her bloodstream. The pain was sharp, precise, spreading through her circulatory system in waves that she could feel moving from her extremities toward her core. Her neck, her chest, her legs—every major vessel suddenly burned and froze at once.

> "Administering vascular reinforcers," Shade announced, its voice still maddeningly calm. "Preventing stroke and maintaining cerebral perfusion. Discomfort is expected."

Discomfort. The word was so inadequate it would have been funny if Marisa had been capable of forming thoughts beyond the raw animal panic of her body shutting down. The sensation in her veins intensified, and she realized dimly that whatever chemicals Shade was pumping into her bloodstream were the only thing keeping her brain from hemorrhaging under the pressure.

The edges of her vision went from gray to black. She fought it, tried to stay conscious, but her body had other ideas. Blood was pooling in her lower extremities despite the reinforcers, draining from her brain despite Shade's interventions. The darkness spread inward, swallowing the red light, swallowing Hartfield's distorted face, swallowing the burning-freezing sensation in her veins, swallowing everything.

Her last coherent thought was of Rodriguez, who had stopped moving entirely.

Then nothing.

---

Outside the craft, invisible to anyone watching, something impossible was happening.

Shade rose from the parking lot on a pillar of blue-white fire, its external panels actively shifting to match the background sky and suppress any visible signature. The flames from its engines should have been visible for miles—a blazing column of plasma hot enough to vaporize asphalt—but the engine design dispersed and cooled the exhaust so efficiently that within meters of the nozzles, the thermal signature had dropped below detection thresholds.

The craft's ascent was nearly vertical, a column of invisible force punching upward through the atmosphere. It accelerated hard, pulling away from the ground with a violence that would have torn apart any conventional aircraft. The parking lot below showed no signs of disturbance—no scorch marks, no debris, nothing to indicate that a spacecraft had just launched from the middle of industrial New Jersey.

Within seconds, Shade had climbed through ten thousand feet, twenty thousand, the altimeter spinning upward in a blur. The air grew thinner, less resistant, and the craft accelerated harder, pressing its passengers deeper into their restraints. Thirty thousand feet. Forty thousand.

At fifty thousand feet, Shade punched through the altitude where conventional aircraft stopped climbing and kept going, its engines burning at full power, its trajectory flattening as it began the long arc that would take it to the edge of space and beyond. The stars became visible above, no longer twinkling but steady, brilliant points against the black.

Sixty thousand feet. Seventy thousand. The curvature of the Earth became visible now, the horizon bending, the sky above transitioning from deep blue to purple to black.

Shade's adaptive panels continued their work even as the air grew too thin to matter, the craft's angular surfaces now reflecting starlight and the faint glow of distant cities in patterns that made it impossible to resolve against the darkening sky.

Eighty thousand feet. Ninety thousand.

The engines throttled back slightly as Shade approached the apex of its boost phase, the acceleration easing from crushing to merely brutal. Inside, the passengers remained unconscious, their bodies limp in the restraints, their vitals monitored by dozens of sensors woven into the seats.

One hundred thousand feet. The boundary between atmosphere and space, crossed in less than a minute.

Shade's engines cut entirely, and the craft went ballistic, arcing upward on momentum alone. The sudden absence of acceleration would have been a relief, except none of the passengers were conscious to feel it.

Below, the eastern seaboard of the United States was visible in its entirety, a glowing network of cities against the dark curve of the Atlantic. Above, the stars burned with a clarity impossible to see from the ground, and the sun—still below the horizon for the surface—was beginning to paint the upper atmosphere with the first hints of dawn.

Shade coasted upward, silent and invisible, carrying its unconscious cargo toward the apex of its trajectory and the long fall toward California beyond.

---

Marisa woke to weightlessness and panic.

Her body was floating against the restraints, every instinct screaming that she was falling. Her stomach lurched, bile rising in her throat. The mask pumped cool air into her lungs, but it tasted wrong, felt wrong, everything was wrong—

> "Agent Comey. You are conscious. Please remain calm. We are in ballistic flight. Weightlessness is normal and expected. You are not falling."

Shade's voice cut through the panic like a knife through fog. Marisa forced her eyes open, forced herself to focus.

The cabin was still lit with that dim red glow, but now there was another light source—a viewport, or a screen, showing the view outside. And what she saw made her breath catch in her throat.

Earth. Not a picture, not a simulation. Earth itself, curving away below them, impossibly blue and white against the infinite black of space. She could see the entire East Coast from Virginia to Maine, see the Great Lakes glittering in the early morning sun, see the demarcation line between day and night cutting across the continent.

They were in *space*.

> "Holy shit," Hartfield breathed from across the cabin. His voice was hoarse, raw. "Holy *shit*."

Marisa couldn't look away from the viewport. The scale of it was overwhelming. Cities she'd lived in, airports she'd transited through, the highways and rivers and borders that defined her entire world—all of it reduced to points of light and thin lines drawn across a sphere that suddenly seemed both vast and impossibly fragile. Somewhere down there, people were waking up, making coffee, stuck in traffic, completely unaware that the world they knew was built on foundations of sand. That there were people and technologies and organizations that could do *this*—launch into space from a parking lot in New Jersey and cross a continent in the time it took to eat breakfast.

She thought about her career, about the cases she'd worked, the terrorists and criminals she'd helped bring down. People who killed for money or ideology or pure nihilism. And all of it, every investigation, every arrest, every conviction—it suddenly felt like playing in a sandbox while the adults conducted business she couldn't begin to comprehend.

The FBI didn't know. Her superiors didn't know. The President probably didn't know. Whatever the EarthSpace Federation was, whatever infrastructure and capabilities they possessed, they'd managed to operate in complete secrecy while possessing technology that made NASA look like children with model rockets. The implications made her head spin worse than the zero gravity.

And underneath the shock, underneath the existential vertigo of realizing everything she thought she knew was incomplete, there was something else. Something she couldn't quite name. A tiny spark of wonder that refused to be suppressed, no matter how terrifying the circumstances. She was seeing what maybe a few hundred people in all of human history had ever seen. The entire planet, laid out below her like a living map. The thin blue line of atmosphere that separated life from the infinite void. The stars, unwavering and brilliant, no longer filtered through miles of air.

It was beautiful. Impossibly, terrifyingly beautiful.

> "Welcome back," LeBouf said quietly, his eyes still closed. "We are at apogee. One hundred sixty-eight kilometers altitude. The view is spectacular, I am told, though I prefer not to look."

> "How can you not look?" Marisa heard herself say, her voice barely a whisper.

> "Because every time I see it," LeBouf replied, "I remember how small we are. How fragile everything is. And right now, I need to believe we are large enough and strong enough to save it."

Marisa looked around. Martinez was stirring, groaning softly. Rodriguez was still unconscious, his head lolled forward against his restraints, but she could see the gentle rise and fall of his chest.

The moment was already passing. Reality was reasserting itself. They had a job to do. Two EMP devices. Millions of lives at stake. And less than twelve minutes to stop it.

> "Ground assets have located both EMP devices," Shade announced, breaking the moment with clinical efficiency. "Device One is confirmed at the financial district target. Device Two is confirmed at a secondary location in the Mission District. We will be landing at San Francisco International Airport in approximately eleven minutes."

> "SFO?" Hartfield's voice was sharp, cutting through the awe. "You can't just land a—whatever the hell this is—at a commercial airport."

> "San Francisco International is currently experiencing a major equipment failure," Shade replied, its tone utterly neutral. "All air traffic control systems are non-operational. No flights are being conducted at this time."

There was a beat of silence.

> "Did *you* do that?" Martinez asked, his voice sharp.

> "I respectfully decline to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me," Shade said, maintaining the same clinical tone.

> "You crashed an entire airport?" Martinez's voice cracked slightly on the last word.

> "I initiated a comprehensive but temporary systems disruption that will be attributed to a software cascade failure," Shade corrected. "No aircraft are at risk. All active flights have been diverted to alternate airports. The disruption will resolve itself approximately forty-seven minutes after we depart the area."

LeBouf finally opened his eyes, though he kept them carefully fixed on the cabin ceiling, avoiding the viewport.

> "Once we land, the two teams will split," he said, his voice steady now, back to business. "My team takes the financial district. Your team takes the Mission. Shade has two vehicles in the cargo bay—Q-cars. They look like civilian vehicles but they are not. Shade will be controlling the San Francisco traffic control grid to clear our path."

> "Q-cars," Marisa repeated. "As in James Bond."

> "Actually, they're named after the Q-ships from World War Two," LeBouf said. "Wolves in sheep's clothing. Armed merchant vessels disguised as easy targets. The name fits—civilian appearance, military capability. They're fast, they're armored, and they have countermeasures. You won't need to drive—Shade will handle that. Your job is to get to the target, neutralize any threats, and secure the EMP device before it can be activated."

> "And if it activates before we get there?" Hartfield asked.

> "Then millions of people lose power, thousands die from infrastructure collapse, and we have a much larger problem," LeBouf said flatly. "So we don't let that happen."

Rodriguez groaned, his head lifting slowly from his chest. His voice came out slurred, confused.

> "Did I... did I die?"

> "No," Martinez said, his own voice not much steadier. "But you might wish you had."

> "All personnel, secure for reentry," Shade announced. "We will begin deceleration in sixty seconds. G-forces will peak at four point one gravities. Duration: approximately six minutes. Consciousness should be maintained throughout. Probably."

> "Probably?" Marisa's stomach dropped, and not from the zero gravity.

> "Reentry is less traumatic than launch," LeBouf said, though his hands were already gripping his restraints tighter. "The deceleration is more gradual. You'll stay conscious. It just... it's not pleasant."

> "None of this is pleasant," Hartfield muttered.

The viewport showed the Earth beginning to rotate slowly as Shade adjusted its attitude for reentry. The Pacific Ocean was visible now, a vast expanse of blue-gray dotted with clouds. Somewhere down there, San Francisco waited. And two EMP devices were counting down to detonation.

Marisa took one last look at the view—the curvature of the Earth, the thin blue line of atmosphere, the black of space above—and tried to commit it to memory. If she survived the next hour, if she survived whatever the hell the FBI was going to do when they found out about all of this, she wanted to remember what it felt like to see the world from here. To understand, even if only for a few minutes, how small and how vast everything really was.

> "Thirty seconds to reentry interface," Shade announced. "All systems nominal. Adaptive thermal protection active. Beginning orientation burn."

There was a brief pulse of acceleration, just enough to shift Marisa's stomach, as Shade fired its maneuvering thrusters. The craft rotated smoothly, nose angling down toward the atmosphere below. Through the viewport, the Earth seemed to rise up to meet them.

> "Ten seconds. Brace for deceleration."

LeBouf's eyes were closed again, his jaw set. Across from Marisa, Hartfield was staring at the viewport with an expression somewhere between determination and barely controlled terror. Martinez and Rodriguez looked like they were reconsidering every life choice that had led them to this moment.

> "Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One. Reentry interface."

The universe caught fire.

---

The deceleration was different from launch, but no less brutal. Instead of being crushed into the seat by acceleration, Marisa felt herself pushed forward against the restraints as Shade fought against the atmosphere to slow down. The g-forces built gradually, relentlessly, pressing on her chest and shoulders like a steadily increasing weight.

Through the viewport, she could see the glow—a brilliant orange-white aura that surrounded the craft as friction heated the air to plasma temperatures. The adaptive panels on Shade's hull were managing the thermal load, redirecting heat away from critical structures, but the light was still intense enough to wash out everything else.

> "Four gravities," Shade announced. "All systems nominal. Current altitude sixty-two thousand feet, descending."

Marisa's breathing came in short, controlled gasps. Her ribs ached from the pressure. Across from her, Hartfield's face was pale, his jaw clenched, but his eyes were open and focused. Martinez and Rodriguez looked worse, but they were conscious, which was apparently better than expected.

LeBouf's voice came through the comm, tight but steady.

> "Halfway through. You're doing fine. Just keep breathing."

The glow outside the viewport began to fade as Shade descended into thicker atmosphere and its velocity dropped below the point where air compressed into plasma. The view changed from orange fire to clouds rushing past at impossible speeds, then blue sky, then the first hints of landscape below.

> "Two gravities. Thirty thousand feet."

The pressure eased. Marisa could breathe normally again. Her body still felt heavy, compressed, but it was manageable. She could move her arms, turn her head.

> "Subsonic. Fifteen thousand feet. Final approach to San Francisco International."

The viewport showed the San Francisco Bay spreading out below them, the city rising on hills to the north, the airport visible as a complex of runways jutting out into the water. Even from this altitude, Marisa could see that something was wrong. No aircraft were moving. The control tower was dark. The entire facility looked frozen, suspended in an artificial stasis.

> "Cloaking system active," Shade announced. "Landing configuration. Gear down."

There was a soft mechanical sound as the landing gear extended. Through the viewport, the airport grew larger, individual buildings becoming distinct. Shade was descending fast, too fast, but the deceleration felt controlled, purposeful.

> "Three thousand feet. Two thousand. One thousand."

The ground rushed up. Marisa's stomach lurched. Then, with barely a whisper of contact, Shade touched down on the tarmac near a service gate on the airport's eastern perimeter. The craft rolled forward for a few seconds, then stopped.

> "Landing complete," Shade said. "San Francisco International Airport. Local time twenty-two forty-three. All personnel may release restraints."

The restraints retracted automatically, flowing back into the seats. Marisa's mask unsealed with a soft hiss, lifting away from her face. She took a breath of normal air and realized her hands were shaking.

They'd just gone to space. They'd crossed the continent in twenty-three minutes. And now they were in San Francisco, invisible, at a crippled international airport, about to stop two EMP devices from destroying the city.

LeBouf was already out of his seat, moving toward the aft section of the cabin where a door was sliding open to reveal what must be the cargo bay. The two other ESF operators followed him, their movements crisp and professional despite having just experienced the same brutal flight.

> "FBI team, with me," LeBouf called. "Let's move. Your clock is already running."

Marisa unbuckled and stood, her legs wobbling slightly. Hartfield was beside her, Martinez and Rodriguez pulling themselves up. They followed LeBouf into the cargo bay, and Marisa stopped short.

The bay was larger than she'd expected, the ceiling higher, and sitting on the deck were two vehicles that looked like they'd just driven off a rental car lot. One was a dark blue Toyota Camry. The other was a silver Honda Accord. Completely ordinary. Completely unremarkable. The kind of cars you'd see in any airport parking lot and forget immediately.

Except for the way they sat on their suspension, just slightly too low and stable. Except for the way the paint seemed just a shade too matte, too perfect. Except for the fact that they were sitting inside a spacecraft that had just returned from the edge of space.

LeBouf gestured to the Honda.

> "That's yours. Shade will drive. Your target is in the Mission District, nineteen minutes away at normal speeds. Shade will get you there in eight. Get in."

The ramp was already extending, lowering toward the tarmac. The harsh glow of airport lighting spilled in, along with the smell of jet fuel and the distant sound of confused voices from the terminal buildings.

Marisa and her team moved to the Honda. The doors were unlocked, opening with a soft click that sounded too normal for what it was. She climbed into the front passenger seat. Hartfield took the back left, Rodriguez the back right, Martinez the seat behind her.

The interior looked normal. Gray cloth seats. Plastic dashboard. Cup holders. A touchscreen infotainment system. Everything completely ordinary, except—

Marisa's eye caught something on the windshield. At first she thought it was a reflection, but then she realized it was information, projected directly onto the glass. A heads-up display, showing what looked like a minimap of San Francisco's street grid in the corner, along with text readouts for speed, distance, and a countdown timer.

37:12
37:11
37:10

Thirty-seven minutes. That's how long they had before the EMP devices activated.

> "Shade?" Hartfield's voice was uncertain from the back seat.

> "I am here, Agent Hartfield," the AI replied, its voice now coming from the car's speakers. "Please secure your seatbelts. Departure in ten seconds."

The engine started. Or at least, Marisa assumed it did—there was barely any sound, just a soft hum that felt more like an electric motor than a conventional engine. The Honda rolled down the ramp, tires touching the tarmac with a soft thump.

The moment they cleared the spacecraft, Marisa looked back and saw nothing. The ramp was retracting, but Shade itself was invisible, a perfect void in the morning light. Then even the ramp disappeared, and there was just empty tarmac.

The Honda accelerated smoothly, heading toward the service gate. As they approached, the barrier lifted on its own, the automated system responding to commands it shouldn't be able to receive. They passed through onto the access road, and suddenly they were just another car in San Francisco, completely invisible in the most important way—by being exactly what everyone expected to see.

On the windshield, a glowing blue line appeared, overlaid on the street ahead, showing their route like something out of a video game. It curved left, toward the airport exit, then merged onto the highway heading north into the city.

> "Following optimal route to target," Shade announced. "Traffic control systems have been accessed. All signals will be synchronized for our passage. Estimated time to destination: eight minutes, twelve seconds."

The Honda accelerated, smoothly but insistently. Marisa watched the speedometer climb—forty, fifty, sixty miles per hour, and they were still in the airport access road. The ride was glass-smooth, no vibration, no road noise, nothing that suggested they were in a car that probably cost twenty-five thousand dollars new.

They merged onto Highway 101, and the Honda accelerated harder. Seventy. Eighty. Ninety.

> "Jesus Christ," Rodriguez breathed from the back seat. "This is not a Honda."

> "Wolf in sheep's clothing," Hartfield muttered.

The car handled like it was on rails. Every curve, every lane change, executed with precision that no human driver could match. Traffic was lighter than usual for the late hour, and the synchronized traffic signals were clearing their path, but the Honda was weaving through lanes with aggressive precision, moving at speeds no one would expect from a rental-grade sedan.

Marisa kept her eyes on the heads-up display. The blue line showing their route curved and branched, anticipating every turn. The countdown timer ticked steadily downward.

35:47
35:46
35:45

Ahead, a traffic light turned green just as they approached. Then another. Then another. The entire city's traffic control system was bending itself around their path, clearing the way, making them invisible not through technology but through perfection—by being exactly where they needed to be, exactly when they needed to be there, never quite breaking enough laws to be noticed but never slowing down.

The Honda took an exit, banking smoothly onto a surface street. The neighborhood changed from industrial to residential. The Mission District. Somewhere in these streets, hidden in a building that looked like every other building, was an EMP device counting down to detonation.

And they had thirty-five minutes to find it.

---

Shade guided them through the narrow streets with the same precision it had shown on the highway, taking turns at exactly the right moment, maintaining speeds that would have been reckless in human hands but felt perfectly controlled. The heads-up display showed their route threading between residential blocks and commercial strips, past late-night taquerias and convenience stores, deeper into the Mission.

The countdown timer ticked relentlessly downward.

33:18
33:17
33:16

> "Target building ahead," Shade announced. "Folsom and Twenty-third. The structure is a former electronics retail space, currently vacant, listed for lease."

Marisa could see it through the windshield—a nondescript two-story building on the corner, its windows dark, a weathered "FOR LEASE" sign hanging crookedly from the front door. It looked exactly like what it was supposed to be: another casualty of the city's economic churn, waiting for a new tenant that might never come.

The Honda pulled to the curb across the street, the engine dropping to an idle that was barely audible.

> "Electromagnetic signatures are consistent with a high-energy charging device," Shade continued, its voice now taking on a more urgent tone. "The readings suggest a capacitor bank building toward critical discharge levels. Based on the energy buildup pattern, I estimate ten minutes and thirty-seven seconds until the device reaches full power and detonates."

Ten minutes. Marisa's mouth went dry.

Hartfield was already opening his door, his rifle coming up as he scanned the street. "No time for recon. We go in fast and hard."

> "Agreed," Marisa said, checking her sidearm. "Rodriguez, Martinez, you take the back entrance. Hartfield and I go through the front."

The team moved with practiced efficiency, crossing the empty street in a tactical formation. The building's facade was covered by a roll-up security shutter, the kind used by electronics stores and small retailers. A heavy padlock secured it to the ground.

Hartfield didn't hesitate. He raised his rifle, aimed at the padlock, and fired. The .308 round shattered the lock mechanism in a shower of sparks and metal fragments. The sound echoed off the surrounding buildings, impossibly loud in the quiet night.

> "So much for stealth," Martinez muttered through the comm.

> "We're past stealth," Hartfield replied, already grabbing the bottom of the shutter. "Help me get this up."

Marisa joined him, and together they hauled the metal barrier upward. It rose with a grinding screech that seemed to announce their presence to half the Mission District. Behind the shutter was a glass storefront, its windows covered with brown paper from the inside.

Hartfield stepped back and fired twice more, the rifle rounds punching through the glass in a cascade of glittering fragments. He kicked away the remaining shards and stepped through the opening.

Marisa followed, her pistol raised, flashlight cutting through the darkness inside.

What she saw made her stop dead.

The interior of the store had been completely gutted. All the retail fixtures were gone, leaving an open space that stretched back toward what must have been the storage area. But the space wasn't empty.

In the center of the room, surrounded by a maze of thick cables and cooling equipment, was a device that looked like it had been assembled by someone who understood physics but had never heard of aesthetics. Banks of capacitors the size of refrigerators were arranged in a rough circle, their surfaces covered with warning labels and heat exchangers. Between them, a complex web of cables carried power to a central hub—a cylindrical device about the size of a garbage can, suspended from the ceiling by an intricate framework of supports.

The entire assembly hummed with barely contained energy. The air itself seemed to vibrate, and Marisa could feel the hair on her arms standing up from the electromagnetic field.

But what made her blood freeze was the sound it was making—a rising whine, like a jet engine spooling up, that was getting noticeably louder even in the few seconds she'd been watching.

Shade's voice came through their earpieces, urgent now.

> "Confirmed. This is the EMP device. The charging cycle is in its final phase. Based on the electromagnetic signature, you have exactly ten minutes and fourteen seconds before detonation."

Marisa stared at the device, her mind racing. The whine was getting louder, more insistent. Whatever was happening inside that central cylinder, it was building toward something catastrophic. She could see status lights blinking faster on the capacitor banks, their rhythm accelerating like a heartbeat under stress.

She turned to Hartfield, desperation creeping into her voice.

> "James. I'm not a bomb technician, I don't know what to do..."

Shade's voice cut through her rising panic, calm and precise in her earpiece.

> "Marisa, have you ever played *Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes*? Describe the device, and I'll walk you through it."

Marisa blinked. Of all the things she'd expected to hear in this moment, a reference to a video game wasn't one of them. But there was something oddly reassuring about Shade's matter-of-fact tone, as if disarming improvised EMP devices was just another Tuesday for the AI.

> "I... what?"

> "The game where one person describes a bomb and another person guides them through defusing it," Shade explained, its voice maintaining that same clinical calm. "Same principle. You are my eyes. Describe what you see on the central device. Start with any text or markings."

Marisa moved closer to the suspended cylinder, her flashlight beam playing across its surface. The metal was warm to the touch, almost hot, and she could feel the electromagnetic field intensifying as she approached. Warning labels in multiple languages covered most of the surface, but there was something else—text stamped directly into the metal.

> "It's... Russian. Looks like..." She squinted at the Cyrillic characters, trying to make sense of the unfamiliar alphabet. "M, a small b, an e with two dots above it, a wonky *pi*..."

> "Mjolnir," Shade said immediately. "Continue."

> "T, a sort of backwards N, and a square with the bottom missing, then 14."

> "Type 14," Shade confirmed. "Mjolnir Type 14. That gives me the specifications I need. This is a Russian-designed electromagnetic pulse generator, likely acquired through black market channels. The good news is that I have the technical documentation. The bad news is that you have nine minutes and forty-three seconds."

Marisa's hands were shaking now, but she forced herself to stay focused. Around her, she could hear Rodriguez and Martinez moving through the back of the building, securing the rear entrance. Hartfield was watching the street through the broken storefront, his rifle ready.

> "What do I need to do?" she asked.

> "Look for a control panel or access port," Shade instructed. "The Type 14 should have a maintenance interface somewhere on the primary housing. It will likely be covered by a removable plate or panel."

Marisa circled the device slowly, her flashlight beam searching the surface. There—on the side facing away from the entrance, she found what looked like a rectangular outline in the metal, barely visible except for the slight gap around the edges.

> "I think I found it. Rectangular panel, about the size of a paperback book."

> "Good. You'll need to remove that panel. Look for screws or fasteners."

Marisa examined the panel more closely. Four small hex screws, one at each corner.

> "Hartfield, do you have a multi-tool or something? I need to get these screws out."

Hartfield reached into his tactical vest and pulled out a red Swiss Army knife, flipping it open to reveal a small screwdriver. "This work?"

> "Perfect." Marisa took the tool and began working on the first screw. The metal was warm under her fingers, and she could feel vibration from the machinery inside. "Shade, I'm getting the panel off."

> "Excellent. Once you have it open, describe what you see inside."

The screws came out easily, as if the panel had been designed for quick access. When the last one dropped into her palm, the rectangular piece of metal lifted away, revealing the device's interior electronics.

Marisa peered inside with her flashlight. A maze of circuit boards, wiring harnesses, and components she couldn't begin to identify. But there was a certain logic to the layout—clearly labeled connection points, color-coded wires, and what looked like a simplified control interface.

> "Okay, I see... a lot of electronics. There's a small display screen that's showing numbers counting down. And there are these thick cables, different colors—red, yellow, blue, black."

> "The countdown display confirms we're in the right place," Shade said. "Now, look for a component labeled with a skull and crossbones or the word 'DANGER' in red lettering. That will be the fail-safe mechanism."

Marisa's beam swept across the components until she found it—a small black box with bright red warning symbols and Cyrillic text.

> "Found it. Black box, lots of warning labels."

> "Perfect. You should see two wires connected to that box—one yellow, one green. Disconnect the yellow wire first. Pull it straight out."

Marisa located the wires. Her hands were steady now, focused on the task. She grasped the yellow connector and pulled. It came free with a soft click.

> "Yellow wire disconnected."

> "Good. Now the green one."

Another click as the second wire came free.

> "Both disconnected. The countdown is still running."

> "That's normal. We've disabled the fail-safe, but now we need to disconnect the primary charging circuits. Look for a series of thick black cables, probably six of them, each connected to a separate terminal block."

Marisa found them—six heavy cables running from the central housing to different points around the device's perimeter.

> "I see them. Six black cables."

> "Disconnect them one at a time, starting from the left and working clockwise. Each one will reduce the device's power by roughly sixteen percent."

The first connector required some effort to remove, but once Marisa understood the mechanism, the others came easier. As each cable disconnected, she could hear the whine of the device dropping in pitch, the electromagnetic field weakening.

> "One... two... three... four... five... six. All disconnected."

> "Excellent. The charging cycle should be interrupted now. One final step—look for a cylindrical component about the size of a flashlight battery, probably red or orange in color. That's the primary initiator."

Marisa's light found it immediately—a bright red cylinder secured with a simple threaded cap.

> "Red cylinder, threaded cap."

> "Unscrew the cap and remove the initiator. Set both pieces aside carefully."

Marisa twisted the cap counterclockwise until it came free, then gently lifted out the red cylinder. The moment she set it aside, the device's whine died completely. The electromagnetic field faded. The status lights on the capacitor banks shifted from red to amber.

> "Done," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's... it's quiet."

> "Confirmed," Shade announced. "Electromagnetic signature has dropped to baseline levels. The device is neutralized. Well done, Marisa."

Marisa slumped against the wall, the adrenaline finally catching up with her. Her hands were shaking again, but this time from relief rather than fear. Around her, the capacitor banks continued their transition from red to amber, the device's death rattle finally complete.

> "Rodriguez, Martinez," she called through the comm. "Device is neutralized. Secure the scene and call it in."

> "Copy that," Rodriguez's voice came back, tight with relief. "SFPD is already en route. Someone reported the gunshots."

Marisa pulled out her phone and dialed the San Francisco FBI field office. It took three transfers and two explanations before she reached someone with enough clearance to understand what she was telling them.

> "This is Special Agent Comey, counter-terrorism. I'm at Folsom and Twenty-third in the Mission District with a neutralized EMP device that requires immediate federal response. I need a bomb squad, evidence collection, and someone from the weapons of mass destruction unit."

The next hour was a blur of flashing lights, crime scene tape, and federal agents trying to understand how a device of this sophistication had ended up in an abandoned electronics store. Marisa gave her statement three times, each version carefully edited to remove any mention of spacecraft, AI assistance, or suborbital flights. As far as the official record would show, they'd received an anonymous tip and responded accordingly.

By the time the relief team arrived from the San Francisco field office, dawn was beginning to touch the eastern sky. Marisa handed over the scene to a senior agent who looked like she'd been roused from bed, then walked back to where the Honda sat waiting at the curb.

> "Time to go," Hartfield said, already climbing into the back seat. "Before someone starts asking questions we can't answer."

The drive back to SFO was quieter than their arrival. No racing through synchronized traffic lights, no aggressive lane changes. Shade kept to normal speeds, blending seamlessly with the early morning commuters beginning their daily routines. The heads-up display was gone, the countdown timer replaced by nothing more threatening than a GPS showing their route to the airport.

> "How did LeBouf's team do?" Marisa asked.

> "Device Two was neutralized forty-seven minutes ago," Shade replied. "Similar design, though the financial district location presented additional security challenges. The team is already at the rendezvous point."

At SFO, the airport was slowly coming back to life. The mysterious equipment failure had ended as suddenly as it had begun, and air traffic control was working through the backlog of delayed flights. The Honda pulled through the same service gate they'd used earlier, the barrier lifting automatically to admit them.

Shade's craft was invisible again, nothing but empty tarmac where Marisa knew it was parked. The Honda rolled to a stop at the precise spot where the ramp should be, and sure enough, the opening materialized as they approached—a rectangular portal into an aircraft that existed only as a void in space.

LeBouf and his team were already aboard when Marisa and her agents climbed the ramp. The ESF operative looked tired but satisfied, his usual composure restored now that the immediate crisis had passed.

> "Both devices neutralized," he reported as they strapped themselves back into the acceleration seats. "San Francisco will wake up with power, running water, and working traffic lights. They'll never know how close they came."

> "What happens to the devices?" Martinez asked.

Marisa found herself answering before LeBouf could speak.

> "The FBI will trace the components, follow the money, build their case," she said, surprised by her own certainty. "But this was bigger than two devices. There's a network behind this—procurement, logistics, placement. The Bureau will tear it apart piece by piece. We'll find everyone involved, from the financiers down to the courier who delivered the components. No one who had a hand in this walks away."

LeBouf nodded approvingly. "The official investigation will handle the criminal prosecution. But the intelligence assessment—understanding how this network operated, what other capabilities they might have, what it means for future threats—that's a joint responsibility."

The ramp retracted, sealing them inside. But this time, there was no rush, no countdown timer driving them toward desperate measures. Shade's engines spun up gradually, building power at a comfortable pace.

> "Departing San Francisco International," Shade announced. "Flight time to Washington D.C. will be approximately four hours and thirty minutes. Normal flight profile. Please feel free to move about the cabin once we reach cruising altitude."

Four and a half hours. A normal flight, at normal altitudes, breathing normal air. After everything they'd been through, the prospect felt almost luxurious.

The takeoff was gentle, barely more than a slight push back into the seats. Through the viewport, Marisa watched San Francisco fall away below them—the bay, the bridges, the city sprawling across its hills. The aircraft rose smoothly, still cloaked, invisible to the air traffic controllers who were frantically trying to manage the morning's delayed flights. No radar signature, no flight plan, no trace that they had ever been there.

Once they reached cruising altitude, the restraints retracted and the cabin lighting shifted to a warmer tone. For the first time since leaving Newark, Marisa could move freely, stretch her legs, breathe without the constant pressure of imminent catastrophe.

She looked around the cabin. Rodriguez and Martinez were already asleep, their heads back against the headrests, exhaustion finally claiming them. Hartfield was staring out the viewport, watching the country pass below. LeBouf and his team were quietly discussing something in French, their voices low and professional.

It was over. Whatever conspiracy had placed those devices in San Francisco, whatever larger threat they represented, tonight's immediate crisis had been resolved. The city would wake up safe, its eight million residents never knowing how close they'd come to losing everything that made modern life possible.

Marisa closed her eyes and tried to process what she'd experienced. Twenty-four hours ago, she'd been a federal agent investigating a routine terrorism case. Now she'd been to space, had seen the Earth from the edge of the atmosphere, had defused a weapon that could have crippled one of America's largest cities. And officially, none of it had happened.

Alicia Monroe's words echoed in her memory, that warning delivered in the sterile conference room that felt like a lifetime ago: *"You're going to see things that will make you question what's possible."* At the time, Marisa had thought she understood what that meant. She'd imagined classified technologies, maybe some advanced surveillance capabilities, perhaps weapons systems that weren't public knowledge.

She hadn't imagined *this*. She hadn't imagined sitting in a spacecraft that could reach the edge of space in minutes, guided by an artificial intelligence that could hack airport control systems while providing step-by-step bomb disposal instructions with the casual efficiency of a GPS giving driving directions. She hadn't imagined watching the curvature of the Earth through a viewport while traveling at speeds that made commercial aviation look like walking.

And yet, somehow, it all made a terrible kind of sense. The EarthSpace Federation. Shade. LeBouf and his unremarkable face that concealed capabilities she was only beginning to understand. They operated in the spaces between the official world and the real one, keeping threats like tonight from ever reaching public awareness. It was exactly the kind of shadow government conspiracy that would have appalled her yesterday.

Today, after watching them save millions of lives with casual efficiency, she wasn't sure how she felt about it.

But Monroe had been wrong about one thing. It wasn't just that she was questioning what was possible—she was questioning what was *necessary*. How many other threats like tonight's were being handled by people who didn't officially exist? How many disasters had been prevented by technology that wasn't supposed to be real? How many times had the world come close to catastrophe while ordinary people went about their daily lives, completely unaware that civilization was hanging by a thread?

The scope of it was staggering. If the ESF had this level of capability, what else was out there? What other organizations operated in the shadows? What other technologies existed beyond public knowledge?

Marisa opened her eyes and looked around the cabin again. Rodriguez and Martinez were still asleep, their faces peaceful in the gentle cabin lighting. Hartfield was awake but quiet, staring out the viewport with an expression she couldn't read. LeBouf and his team were reviewing something on a tablet, their conversation too low to overhear.

All of them had just experienced something that would fundamentally change how they saw the world. But only she would have to go back to her regular job, file reports that couldn't include any of the truth, and pretend that none of this had happened. The others were part of this shadow world. She was just a visitor, granted temporary access to capabilities and knowledge that she'd have to spend the rest of her career pretending didn't exist.

Outside the viewport, the sun was climbing higher, painting the clouds below in shades of gold and pink. Somewhere ahead lay Washington, and whatever debriefing awaited her return. But for now, for these few hours, she could simply sit in this impossible aircraft and watch America pass below, carried by technology that shouldn't exist toward a future she couldn't quite imagine.

The world was larger and stranger than she'd ever known. And perhaps, she was beginning to think, that wasn't entirely a bad thing.

## Chapter 6: Debrief

The approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport felt almost surreal after everything Marisa had experienced. Shade descended through normal airspace at normal speeds, following standard approach vectors like any other aircraft. The only difference was that air traffic control couldn't see them—their radar screens showing clear skies while a forty-meter spacecraft glided silently toward the runway.

> "Final approach, Runway Zero-One," Shade announced with the same clinical precision it had maintained throughout the flight. "Local time zero-six-thirty-seven. Weather is clear, winds light and variable."

Through the viewport, Marisa could see the Potomac River winding through the dawn landscape, the Washington Monument catching the early morning light. The city was waking up, traffic beginning to build on the highways, people starting another ordinary day completely unaware that two EMP devices had nearly turned San Francisco into a dead zone just hours earlier.

The landing was as gentle as the takeoff had been brutal twelve hours ago. Shade touched down on a service runway away from the main terminal, rolling to a stop near what looked like an abandoned maintenance hangar. The kind of place where aircraft came to be forgotten, not to discharge passengers who had just returned from preventing a catastrophic terrorist attack.

As the engines wound down, Marisa noticed that LeBouf and his team had changed clothes during the flight. Gone were the tactical vests, the combat gear, the obvious military hardware. Now they wore civilian clothing—khakis, polo shirts, light jackets that could have come from any department store. LeBouf himself had traded his operational kit for a navy blue windbreaker and dark slacks, looking every inch the unremarkable federal employee.

But there was something about the way the clothes fit that bothered Marisa. The jackets hung just slightly wrong, as if they were concealing more than they revealed. The fabric looked ordinary but moved in ways that suggested hidden reinforcement. Even the shoes—simple leather oxfords—seemed just a shade too substantial for their apparent purpose.

> "FBI team, we'll be taking separate vehicles back to headquarters," LeBouf said as the restraints retracted. "Standard procedure—we maintain operational security until the formal debrief is complete."

The cargo bay revealed the same two Q-cars they'd used in San Francisco—the silver Honda Accord and the dark blue Toyota Camry. No additional vehicles, no government fleet cars. Just the same unremarkable sedans that had carried them through the Mission District at impossible speeds, now looking every inch like the rental cars they were supposed to be.

Marisa and her team climbed back into the Honda while LeBouf's group took the Toyota. As they pulled away from the hangar, Marisa looked back to see Shade's ramp retracting, the craft beginning its transition back to invisibility. Within moments, there was nothing but empty tarmac and the faint smell of jet fuel in the air.

The drive through Washington morning traffic felt like stepping back into a different world. Normal cars driven by normal people heading to normal jobs, their biggest concerns probably centered around coffee and commute times. Marisa watched them through the Honda's windows—a woman in a Civic talking on her phone, a man in a pickup truck checking his reflection in the side mirror, teenagers in a beat-up Corolla laughing at something on someone's phone.

None of them knew how close the world had come to chaos. None of them would ever know.

The FBI's J. Edgar Hoover Building rose ahead of them, its brutalist concrete facade as imposing as ever in the morning light. Marisa had walked through those doors thousands of times, but today felt different. Today she was bringing back secrets that couldn't be written in any report, experiences that couldn't be shared with anyone who didn't already know.

They pulled into the underground garage, the Honda's ordinary appearance getting them through security without question. LeBouf's Toyota was already parked when they arrived, its occupants nowhere to be seen. Marisa suspected they were already inside, probably in a conference room she didn't know existed, preparing for a debriefing that would never appear on any official schedule.

> "Seventh floor," Hartfield said as they stepped into the elevator. "Assistant Director Reeves wants to see us immediately."

Marisa nodded, trying to prepare herself for what was coming. How do you brief your superior on a mission that officially never happened? How do you explain that you've just returned from space, that you've worked with an artificial intelligence that could have stepped out of science fiction, that you've witnessed capabilities that made the FBI's most advanced technologies look like stone tools?

The elevator climbed through the building's floors, each one representing layers of the federal law enforcement bureaucracy. But somewhere above or below or parallel to this official structure was another world entirely—the shadow realm where the EarthSpace Federation operated, where Q-cars masqueraded as rental sedans and spacecraft launched from parking lots in New Jersey.

Marisa caught herself studying LeBouf's reflection in the elevator's polished metal doors. Even in civilian clothes, there was something about his posture, his alertness, that marked him as different. And those clothes—she was becoming more convinced that they weren't as ordinary as they appeared. The way his jacket fell suggested weight distribution that didn't match simple cotton or wool. The seams were too precise, the cut too accommodating for someone who needed to move quickly and quietly.

What kind of technology was woven into fabric that looked like it came from a mall department store? What capabilities were hidden in plain sight, disguised as the mundane uniform of federal bureaucracy?

The elevator chimed softly as it reached the seventh floor, the doors sliding open to reveal the familiar corridors of FBI leadership. But as Marisa stepped out, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was crossing from one world into another—from the realm of impossible possibilities back into the comfortable illusion of normal government operations.

And somewhere in the space between those worlds, the real work of protecting the country continued, invisible and unacknowledged, carried out by people whose ordinary appearances concealed extraordinary capabilities.

## Epilogue: Threshold

The debriefing lasted three hours and covered almost nothing.

Marisa sat across from Assistant Director Reeves in Conference Room 7C, the same sterile space where a thousand other operational reviews had taken place. Hartfield was to her right, his posture perfect, his face carefully neutral. The transcript would show a textbook after-action report: subjects apprehended, devices secured, threat neutralized. Clean. Professional. Utterly mundane.

> "The tactical support provided by ESF was instrumental in the operation's success," Marisa heard herself saying. "Their intelligence capabilities allowed us to identify and interdict the threat before activation."

Reeves nodded, making notes on his tablet. He didn't ask how ESF had obtained their intelligence. Didn't question the timeline, the methodology, the impossible speed of the operation. He simply recorded her sanitized account and moved to the next item.

> "And the devices themselves? They've been secured?"

> "San Francisco Field Office has custody," Hartfield said. "Local PD assisted with the initial seizure. They're being processed through standard evidence protocols for destructive devices."

Which was true, as far as it went. The EMPs were real evidence in a real case. What the report wouldn't mention was how they'd been located—the spacecraft, the orbital surveillance, the AI that had guided them through San Francisco's streets. Those details would never appear in any official document.

The rest of the session followed the same pattern. Questions asked, answers given, both sides carefully avoiding the truths that mattered. Nobody mentioned spacecraft. Nobody discussed artificial intelligence or Q-cars that defied physics. Nobody acknowledged that federal agents had just returned from orbit after witnessing capabilities that shouldn't exist.

By 1300 hours, it was over. Reeves thanked them for their service, commended their professionalism, and dismissed them with the promise that commendations would be forthcoming. The whole thing had the choreographed quality of theater, a performance both sides agreed to maintain.

Marisa returned to her desk on the fifth floor, to the familiar landscape of paperwork and email and case files. Her coffee mug sat where she'd left it three days ago, a ring of dried liquid at the bottom. Her monitor displayed the same background image, the same desktop icons. Everything exactly as it had been.

Except she wasn't.

She tried to work. Pulled up case files, reviewed reports, responded to emails. But her mind kept drifting back to San Francisco, to the way Shade had punched through the atmosphere like it was nothing, to the calm precision of that genderless voice providing real-time intelligence from orbit. She found herself staring at her hands, remembering how they'd gripped the restraints during launch, how her whole body had felt the impossible acceleration.

How did you go back to filing reports after you'd seen Earth from space? How did you focus on database queries when you knew there were AI systems that could see through walls and track targets from orbit? How did you pretend the world was normal when you'd witnessed proof that everything you thought you knew about technology and capability was a comfortable lie?

By 1800 hours, the office had mostly emptied. Marisa sat alone at her desk, the evening light slanting through her window, and pulled out her phone. She stared at Alicia Monroe's contact information for a long moment before finally calling.

Monroe answered on the second ring.

> "Agent Comey. I've been expecting your call."

> "You were right," Marisa said quietly. "About everything."

A pause. Then Monroe's voice, softer now, carrying an edge of something Marisa couldn't quite identify. Not sympathy. Something more complicated.

> "I wish I could tell you it gets easier. But honestly? I don't know if it does."

> "How do you do it?" Marisa asked. "How do you go back to normal after seeing what they can do?"

Another pause, longer this time. When Monroe spoke again, her voice was careful, measured.

> "I can't really talk about my own work with them, Comey. You know how classification works. But I can tell you this: you don't go back. Not really." She sighed. "You just learn to live with knowing. With understanding that the world isn't what everyone thinks it is."

Marisa thought about that. About the impossible weight of knowledge that couldn't be shared, couldn't be discussed, couldn't be written down.

> "It feels like a lie," she said. "Sitting here, filing paperwork, when I know what I know."

> "It is a lie. But it's the lie everyone lives with." Monroe's voice carried a note of resignation. "Most people can't handle the truth, and frankly, they don't need to. They need to believe the world is knowable, controllable, bound by rules they understand. So we maintain that illusion. We let them sleep soundly."

> "We Are Watching," Marisa murmured, remembering the calling card that had started everything.

> "Exactly." Monroe paused. "Look, I wish I could give you better advice. Tell you how to process this, how to compartmentalize it. But I'm still figuring that out myself. All I know is that they're real, they're effective, and they exist for reasons we probably don't fully understand. And now you're one of the people who knows."

> "Lucky me."

> "Lucky all of us, maybe. Somebody has to know. Somebody has to be able to work with them when the situation requires it." Monroe's voice softened slightly. "Get some rest, Comey. And if you ever need to talk—within the limits of what we can discuss—call me. It helps, knowing there's someone else who understands."

After the call ended, Marisa sat in the gathering darkness of her office, watching the city lights come on across Washington. Somewhere out there, LeBouf had returned to whatever ESF facility he called home. Somewhere, Shade was probably already being prepped for another mission. Somewhere, the AI had returned to its mysterious duties, maintaining the invisible web that kept the world from tearing itself apart.

And here she was, back at her desk, surrounded by the comfortable mundanity of federal bureaucracy.

Monroe couldn't give her answers. Couldn't even talk about her own experiences. They were both operating in a world of compartmented knowledge, each carrying secrets the other couldn't know. But at least Monroe understood the weight of it. The isolation of knowing truths that couldn't be shared.

Marisa gathered her things and headed for the elevator. The building was quiet, most agents already gone for the evening. Her footsteps echoed in the empty corridors, a lonely sound that reminded her how isolated this knowledge made her. How few people could understand what she'd seen, what she now knew.

The elevator descended in silence. She watched the numbers count down, each floor taking her further from the classified world of the seventh floor, closer to the ordinary world of ground level. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

The doors opened onto the lobby. She badged out through security, exchanged nods with the evening guard, and stepped through the main entrance into the cool October evening.

The street was busy with end-of-day traffic. Pedestrians hurrying home, cars honking, the usual urban chaos of Washington at rush hour. Marisa paused on the steps, breathing in the city air, trying to ground herself in the familiar.

She turned left, heading toward the Metro station. The sidewalk was crowded, forcing her to weave between slower walkers. A woman in a business suit talking urgently on her phone. A man with a briefcase checking his watch. A delivery driver pushing a hand truck loaded with packages.

And there, moving through the crowd with unremarkable efficiency, was a face she recognized.

Jeane LeBouf.

He wore khakis and a polo shirt, a light jacket that could have come from any department store. His posture had the slight slouch of someone tired from a long day of office work. Everything about him radiated forgettable mediocrity—the kind of person your eyes would slide past without registering.

But Marisa registered him. Saw the too-precise way he moved through the crowd, never quite touching anyone but never slowing either. Saw the subtle awareness in his eyes, the way they tracked his surroundings with practiced efficiency. Saw the person beneath the unremarkable mask.

Their eyes met for a fraction of a second.

LeBouf's expression didn't change. No acknowledgment, no recognition. He simply continued walking, flowing past her in the crowd, disappearing into the urban river of humanity as if he'd never been there at all.

But Marisa had seen him. Had recognized him. And she understood now what that meant.

She would see them everywhere now. In crowded streets and quiet airports, in government buildings and shopping malls. The operatives of the EarthSpace Federation, moving through the world in plain sight, their unremarkable faces concealing extraordinary purpose. Always watching. Always ready. Always there.

Marisa continued toward the Metro, her steps steady, her face composed. To anyone watching, she was just another federal employee heading home after a long day. Tired. Ordinary. Unremarkable.

But inside, she carried the weight of impossible knowledge. The truth about spacecraft that launched from New Jersey. About AI that could see through walls and guide operations from orbit. About people who could do the impossible while looking utterly mundane.

She descended the escalator into the Metro station, letting the crowd flow around her, and wondered which world she truly inhabited now. The comfortable lie of normal federal law enforcement? Or the impossible truth of the Federation's shadow war?

The train arrived with its familiar rumble. Marisa stepped aboard, found a seat, and watched the city disappear into the tunnel darkness.

Somewhere above, the stars were hidden by light pollution and city haze. But she knew they were there. Knew that even now, Federation assets might be passing overhead, invisible and vigilant. Watching. Always watching.

The train rocked gently on its tracks, carrying her home through tunnels that felt somehow different now—not barriers against the world above, but merely one more layer of the elaborate illusion that most people called reality.

Marisa closed her eyes and thought about tomorrow. About returning to her desk, her cases, her paperwork. About pretending that everything was normal while carrying the weight of impossible truths.

Monroe had it right. You don't go back. You just learn to live with knowing.

The train rumbled on through the darkness, carrying her between worlds.
