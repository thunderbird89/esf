## Chapter 1: The Theft

### The Watering Hole

The bar occupied the lower level of a docking station on the Xenari frontier world of Thal'karesh, where the air tasted of recycled atmosphere and the faint metallic tang of starship fuel. It was the sort of establishment where officers from a dozen different species mingled after long patrols, where the lighting was kept deliberately dim, and where questions were politely not asked.

The Kryllian bartender—a stocky figure in his breathing apparatus—moved with practiced efficiency behind the counter, dispensing drinks with mechanical precision. The clientele tonight was typical: a pair of Seraphyn in the corner booth engaged in what appeared to be a philosophical debate conducted entirely through subtle gestures and occasional soft vocalizations, a cluster of off-duty cargo haulers comparing routes near the window, and scattered throughout, the tall, angular figures of Xenari officers on leave.

One such officer sat alone at the bar, his bioluminescent markings pulsing a steady cyan-green that suggested contentment and mild inebriation. Commander Vael'thi had reason to celebrate—his patrol rotation was complete, his ship was due for refit, and he had two full cycles of leave ahead of him before his next assignment. The drink in front of him was his third, a sweet fermented beverage from his homeworld that the Kryllian bartender kept specifically for Xenari customers.

He didn't notice the woman who slid onto the stool beside him until she spoke.

> "Commander Vael'thi?"

Her voice was smooth, with an accent he couldn't quite place—somewhere between the precise articulation of core-world Xenari and the broader tones of outer colonies. He turned to look at her.

She was striking. Roughly his height when standing, with the lean build and graceful movements of a Xenari, but her coloring was unusual—skin tone somewhere between pale blue and silver, with bioluminescent markings that pulsed a warm violet-pink that his instincts read as interest and curiosity. Her large eyes caught the dim light, pupils dilated in the low illumination. She wore civilian clothing, well-tailored but not ostentatious, and carried herself with a confidence that suggested military background.

> "I'm sorry," Vael'thi said, his words slightly slurred. "Do I know you?"

> "Not yet," she said, her markings brightening slightly. "But I've heard about you. The successful interdiction of that Ryzak probe ship three cycles ago? That was impressive work."

Vael'thi's own markings brightened to blue-white—pride mixed with pleasure at the recognition. The probe ship incident had indeed been noteworthy, though it hadn't received wide publicity outside military channels.

> "How did you hear about that?"

> "I work logistics coordination at the orbital yards," she said smoothly. "We see all the repair requisitions. The damage patterns on your ship told an interesting story." She gestured to the bartender. "Whatever the Commander is drinking, and one for me."

The Kryllian bartender set down two glasses without comment.

> "I'm Shael'na," she said, lifting her glass. "To successful patrols and well-earned leave."

Vael'thi touched his glass to hers, the gentle clink of crystalline material musical in the ambient noise. The drink was good, the company was pleasant, and his markings continued to pulse contentment.

They talked. She asked intelligent questions about patrol routes, about the challenges of maintaining readiness in frontier sectors, about the differences between commanding a frigate versus larger vessels. He found himself enjoying the conversation, enjoying her attention. Her markings shifted through shades of violet and soft blue, her body language open and engaged. When she laughed at one of his stories, the sound was genuine.

The fourth drink appeared without him ordering it. Then the fifth.

Somewhere around the sixth drink, Vael'thi noticed his coordination was declining. His large eyes had trouble focusing, and his bioluminescent markings were flickering irregularly—a sign of significant intoxication that his training told him should concern him more than it currently did.

> "I think," he said carefully, "I may have had too much."

> "Probably," Shael'na agreed, her own markings still steady and controlled. "But you're on leave. You've earned it."

She shifted closer on her stool, and he caught her scent—something that his hindbrain registered as appealing, though he couldn't identify why. Her hand rested briefly on his arm, and he felt the warmth of her touch through his uniform sleeve.

> "Your comm unit," she said, gesturing to the small device clipped to his belt. "Is that a command-grade model? I've only seen those in technical specifications."

> "Hmm?" Vael'thi looked down, his vision doubling slightly. "Oh. Yes. Fleet coordination. We need the secure channels."

> "Can I see it? I've always wondered how they compare to standard issue."

Without thinking, his fingers fumbled at the clip. The alcohol had dulled his natural caution, the caution that would normally have recognized the breach of protocol, the security risk. His hands weren't responding properly, clumsy and slow.

> "Here, let me," Shael'na said, her fingers deft as they unclipped the device. She turned it over in her hands, examining it with apparent interest. "The encryption module is integrated? That must make it heavier than standard units."

> "Bit heavier," Vael'thi agreed. His words were starting to slur more noticeably. "But worth it for the security."

She held it for perhaps fifteen seconds, her fingers moving over the surface with practiced ease. When she handed it back, he took it without question, his intoxicated brain registering nothing unusual.

> "Fascinating," she said. "Thank you for indulging my curiosity."

She glanced at her wrist, where a small chrono was embedded. Her markings flickered briefly—a pattern he couldn't quite interpret in his current state.

> "I should let you get some rest," she said, standing smoothly. "You look like you could use it. Enjoy your leave, Commander."

> "Wait," Vael'thi said, his hand reaching out clumsily. "Will I see you again?"

Her markings shifted to something that might have been regret, or might have been satisfaction. It was hard to tell.

> "Perhaps," she said. "The galaxy is smaller than we think."

She moved through the crowd with fluid grace, and Vael'thi watched her go, his vision blurring at the edges. He tried to stand, found his legs less cooperative than expected, and settled for ordering one more drink instead.

The Kryllian bartender served it without comment, his breathing apparatus hissing softly.

---

Three blocks away, in a narrow access corridor between docking bays, the woman who had called herself Shael'na ducked into a maintenance alcove. Her markings—artificial bioluminescence generated by the holographic mask—dimmed to nothing as she reached up and carefully peeled the gossamer-thin material from her features.

Beneath the mask, Operative Kresh'tar's reptilian features were set in grim satisfaction. Her thick scaled hide was a mottled pattern of dark greens and grays, and her secondary eyelids flickered as she adjusted to the change in appearance. The Ryzak intelligence officer flexed her clawed hands, relieved to be free of the uncomfortable disguise.

The holographic technology was sophisticated enough to fool Xenari recognition systems, even to replicate the false warmth of their body temperature. But it couldn't replicate their frailty, their lack of physical strength. Kresh'tar's natural Ryzak physiology—powerful, predatory, built for combat—had required conscious effort to suppress throughout the entire interaction. The mask had done the visual work, but the performance had been all hers.

She pulled a small device from her pocket—an intelligence ministry scanner, compact and purpose-built. When she'd held Vael'thi's comm unit, when she'd examined it with apparent curiosity, the scanner had been pressed against the encryption module, copying its quantum-paired key signatures in a fraction of a second.

The small display confirmed successful acquisition. The encryption keys for Xenari fleet coordination channels, complete with the necessary authentication protocols. Temporary access, perhaps only a few cycles before the theft would be discovered and the keys cycled, but temporary was all they needed.

Kresh'tar allowed herself a moment of satisfaction. The Xenari officer would wake tomorrow with a headache and a vague memory of pleasant conversation. By the time he realized anything was wrong—if he ever did—it would be far too late.

She activated her secure comm, the signal heavily encrypted and routed through three relay points to obscure its origin.

> "Kresh'tar to Operations. Package acquired. Authentication successful. Transmitting now."

The response came immediately, her handler's voice crisp and professional.

> "Confirmed. Return to extraction point. Transport is waiting."

Kresh'tar peeled off the remainder of her disguise—the civilian clothing that concealed her true bulk, the soft shoes that hid her clawed feet—and stowed them in a disposal unit. Beneath, she wore the dark combat suit of Ryzak intelligence, form-fitting and functional.

She moved through the maintenance corridors with the confident stride of a predator, her movements now unrestricted by the need to mimic Xenari grace. The transport would take her back to Ryzak space. Her superiors would decrypt the data. And then, finally, they would have what they needed.

Access to the Xenari jump network.

The Federation had humiliated them. Those mysterious human representatives, operating with Xenari backing, had defied Ryzak superiority again and again. The *Cormorant* gambit, the ambush that had cost them three frigates and valuable intelligence operatives. The other encounters, each one ending in unexpected resistance and Ryzak losses.

But the Federation was small, secretive, operating in the shadows. The humans themselves—billions of them on their homeworld—had never faced the Ryzak. Had never even met an alien species. They were defenseless, unaware, completely unprepared for what was coming.

But no longer.

If the humans wanted to hide behind Xenari protection, then the Ryzak would simply remove that protection. A pre-emptive strike, executed before the humans could coordinate with their benefactors, before the Xenari could respond with their superior numbers.

Sol system had no stargate. Without a jump beacon, interstellar travel to the system was impossible—the only way in or out was through the Xenari jump beacon near Jupiter. And with the encryption keys now in Ryzak possession, that beacon could be accessed. A subjugation flotilla could bridge directly into the system, bypass the normal security protocols, and strike before anyone knew they were coming.

Kresh'tar's mandibles clicked in anticipation.

The humans would learn what it meant to face the Ryzak when they weren't hiding behind their mysterious benefactors and their stolen technology.

And Earth would burn.

### The Morning After

Vael'thi woke to sunlight streaming through the viewport of his quarters, the warm glow of the system's star cutting through the thin curtains. His head throbbed with the steady rhythm of a fusion reactor running just slightly out of phase. His bioluminescent markings pulsed a sickly grayish-blue—the biological equivalent of a hangover warning light.

He groaned, his long limbs tangled in the bedding, and tried to piece together the previous evening. The bar. Celebrating the end of patrol rotation. Drinks. Too many drinks. And—

A woman. Shael'na. Silver-blue skin, violet markings, intelligent questions about ship operations. They'd talked for hours. Or had it been hours? The timeline was hazy, edges blurred by alcohol and poor judgment.

Vael'thi dragged himself upright, his coordination still slightly off. He needed water, analgesics, and approximately six more hours of sleep. In that order.

He stumbled to the small kitchenette, filled a container with water from the dispenser, and drank it in long gulps. His body's biofilm layer felt dehydrated, his skin texture rough. The water helped, marginally.

As cognitive function gradually returned, fragments of conversation surfaced from the alcoholic fog. Patrol routes. Frigate operations. The probe ship interdiction. And—

His comm unit.

The thought arrived with sudden, cold clarity that cut through the hangover like a blade.

She'd asked to see his comm unit. He'd given it to her. No—she'd unclipped it for him because his hands weren't working properly. She'd held it, examined it, asked about the encryption module.

Vael'thi's markings flickered from grayish-blue to dim, uncertain violet. That was protocol violation. Command-grade communications equipment was never to be handled by unauthorized personnel. Never. It was drilled into every officer from their first day of training.

He found the device still clipped to his uniform belt, discarded on the floor where he'd dropped it. The unit looked normal, unmarked, undamaged. He activated it, watching the display come to life with standard startup sequences. Everything appeared functional.

But appearance wasn't the same as security.

Vael'thi stood there for a long moment, water container still in hand, his analytical mind now fully engaged despite the headache. He tried to recall details. Her face—attractive, memorable, but had he seen her before last night? Her accent—she'd said she worked logistics coordination at the orbital yards. That was verifiable. The conversation topics—all professional, all appropriate, nothing that screamed intelligence operative.

Except she'd gotten him drunk, gotten him to hand over secure equipment, and then disappeared.

His markings shifted to rapid flickering violet-pink—intense focus mixed with growing alarm.

He needed to report this. Immediately.

Vael'thi dressed quickly, his movements now sharp and deliberate despite the lingering effects of intoxication. He grabbed a standard-issue comm unit from his desk—not the command-grade one, which was now potentially compromised—and activated the secure channel to station security.

The response came within seconds, a crisp male voice.

> "Security. Go ahead."

> "This is Commander Vael'thi, CNS *Vigilant*. I need to report a potential security breach. Command-grade communications equipment may have been compromised."

There was a pause, brief but significant.

> "Stand by, Commander. Patching you to Intelligence."

The hold lasted perhaps ten seconds before a new voice came on the line, female, with the clipped precision of someone who dealt with worst-case scenarios professionally.

> "Commander Vael'thi, this is Lieutenant Shal'mir, Station Intelligence. Describe the incident."

Vael'thi did, his words precise despite the embarrassment burning through his system. The bar, the drinks, the woman calling herself Shael'na, the examination of his comm unit. He left nothing out, including the excessive alcohol consumption and his impaired judgment.

> "How long did she have physical access to the device?"

> "Fifteen seconds. Perhaps twenty."

> "Did you observe her manipulating the interface?"

> "No. She examined it visually, appeared to be checking the weight and form factor."

Another pause, longer this time.

> "Commander, I need you to bring that comm unit to Intelligence immediately. Do not use it for any communications. Do not connect it to any networks. Physical courier only. Understood?"

> "Understood."

> "And Commander? You mentioned she claimed to work logistics coordination. Did she provide a department or supervisor name?"

Vael'thi's markings dimmed. He hadn't asked. He'd been too drunk, too flattered by the attention, too caught up in the conversation to verify basic information.

> "No. She didn't volunteer it, and I didn't ask."

> "We'll pull security footage from the bar. Description?"

Vael'thi provided it—height, build, coloring, the distinctive silver-blue skin tone and violet markings. As he spoke, a cold certainty settled in his chest. The coloring was unusual. He'd remarked on it mentally at the time, but hadn't questioned it.

Because she was attractive, and he was drunk, and his judgment had been catastrophically compromised.

> "Intelligence will meet you at the security checkpoint in ten minutes. Move now, Commander."

The connection terminated.

Vael'thi looked at the command-grade comm unit in his hand, the device that represented his authority, his access, his responsibility. Fifteen seconds had been more than enough time to copy data, to clone authentication protocols, to compromise everything it represented.

He moved toward the door, his headache forgotten, replaced by a much worse pain—the knowledge that his mistake might have consequences far beyond personal embarrassment.

### Fleet Command

Admiral Thresh'nal's bioluminescent markings pulsed a steady, controlled blue as he reviewed the preliminary intelligence report. His office aboard the orbital station was austere by Xenari standards—minimal decoration, maximum functionality, with viewports showing the curved horizon of Thal'karesh below and the scattered lights of the docked fleet visible against the black.

Lieutenant Shal'mir stood before his desk, her posture formal, her own markings showing the rapid violet flicker of someone delivering very bad news to a superior officer.

> "Security footage confirms an individual matching Commander Vael'thi's description entered and exited the establishment at the times he specified," she said. "However, we cannot find any record of this individual in station personnel databases. No Shael'na working logistics coordination. No one matching that description with current authorization codes."

Thresh'nal's markings dimmed slightly—controlled concern.

> "Biometric scan of the footage?"

> "Inconclusive. The individual's biosignature reads as Xenari, but the coloring doesn't match any known regional variations in our database. The bioluminescent patterns appear natural, but they're... unusual. Our analysts flag a probability of sixty-three percent that the appearance was artificially generated."

> "Disguise technology."

> "Yes, sir. We're cross-referencing with known intelligence capabilities of neighboring powers. The Ryzak have demonstrated advanced infiltration techniques in previous incidents."

Thresh'nal stood, his tall frame unfolding from the chair with characteristic Xenari grace. He moved to the viewport, his reflection ghostly in the transparent material.

> "Commander Vael'thi's comm unit?"

> "Our technical team is analyzing it now. Preliminary scans show no obvious tampering, no inserted hardware, no modifications to the encryption module. However—"

> "However?"

> "The quantum signature logs show a brief external connection approximately matching the timeframe when the device was in the stranger's possession. Fourteen point three seconds of active scanning. The connection was sophisticated enough to avoid triggering the unit's intrusion detection, but it left traces in the deeper system logs."

Thresh'nal's markings shifted through several colors in rapid succession—blue-white alarm, violet focus, then settling into a dim, controlled cyan that indicated strategic thinking.

> "They copied the encryption keys."

> "That's our assessment, sir. Fleet coordination keys, authentication protocols, possibly jump beacon access codes."

> "Which beacons?"

> "Commander Vael'thi's security clearance provides access to seventeen frontier beacons, including—" Shal'mir consulted her datapad, "—the Sol system beacon."

The silence that followed was profound.

Sol system. The protected zone. The human homeworld, where the Federation operated as humanity's secret representatives in galactic affairs. The system had no stargate, and without a jump beacon, interstellar travel was impossible—the single Xenari jump beacon maintained near Jupiter was the only way in or out, used exclusively for covert Federation transport.

A beacon that could now be accessed by anyone with the stolen encryption keys.

> "Time to compromise," Thresh'nal said, his voice steady despite the implications.

> "Unknown, sir. If they copied the keys in that fourteen-second window, they could have transmitted them immediately. Best case, we're looking at several hours since initial compromise. Worst case—"

> "Worst case, they already have ships en route."

> "Yes, sir."

Thresh'nal turned from the viewport, his markings now pulsing the rapid blue-white that indicated decisive action.

> "Alert the Great Circle. Full security protocol. I want fleet-wide encryption key rotation initiated immediately. All beacons, all channels, all authentication codes. How long for the rotation to propagate?"

Shal'mir's markings flickered—calculation mixed with concern.

> "Full fleet rotation will take eighteen hours minimum, sir. Priority channels can be rotated in six hours, but the remote beacons—especially those in protected zones like Sol—operate on longer refresh cycles. We're looking at twenty-four to thirty-six hours for complete network security restoration."

> "Make it happen. Priority authorization from my office. And Lieutenant?"

> "Sir?"

> "Send encrypted warning to the Sol beacon. Inform our contacts in the Federation that their security may be compromised. They need to prepare for possible Ryzak incursion."

Shal'mir's markings pulsed acknowledgment. She turned to leave, then hesitated.

> "Sir, if the Ryzak are planning a strike on Sol, why steal encryption keys instead of simply assembling a force at the border?"

Thresh'nal's markings dimmed to somber violet.

> "Because CONCORD would detect the fleet assembly and issue sanctions before they could reach the system. But a smaller force, using our own jump beacon and our own encryption? They could bridge directly into Sol system, bypass all border security, and achieve complete tactical surprise."

> "A pre-emptive strike."

> "Exactly. Disable the humans before they can coordinate with us, before the Federation can respond, before anyone knows the Ryzak have arrived. By the time we detect the incursion, Earth could be burning."

Shal'mir's bioluminescent markings flickered rapid violet-pink—the pattern that indicated a Xenari processing deeply disturbing implications.

> "The Federation has proven resourceful, sir. They've repelled Ryzak forces before."

> "The Federation," Thresh'nal corrected, his markings pulsing somber violet. "A small, covert organization operating as humanity's representatives. The humans themselves have never encountered alien species. Never faced combat in space. They don't even know the Ryzak exist." He paused. "The Federation might hold against a probe or reconnaissance element. But a dedicated subjugation flotilla, arriving without warning, targeting Earth directly? The humans won't know what hit them."

He moved back to his desk, already pulling up fleet disposition maps and communication protocols.

> "Send the warning. Begin the key rotation. And pray that we're not already too late."

### Ryzak War Council

The command chamber aboard the dreadnought *Bloodfang* was a study in controlled aggression. Dark metal walls bore the scars of countless ritualized duels, and the air carried the scent of heated metal and the musk of Ryzak warriors. High Admiral Kraveth stood before the tactical display, his massive frame silhouetted against the holographic representation of known space. His scales were dark green, almost black, marked with the pale scars of a hundred battles.

Around the chamber, his senior officers waited in disciplined silence. Two carrier captains, four battleship commanders, the cruiser squadron leader, and the destroyer flotilla commander. All bore the clan markings of elite warrior castes, and all had proven themselves in combat trials.

Kraveth's clawed hand gestured at the display, and a section expanded—the Sol system, marked in red as a protected zone, with a single Xenari jump beacon icon pulsing near the outer planets.

> "The encryption keys are verified," he said, his voice a low rumble that carried the weight of authority. "Intelligence confirms full access to Xenari jump network protocols. The window of opportunity is measured in cycles, perhaps less. The Xenari will rotate their keys once they discover the theft."

Captain Vorash, commander of the carrier *Stormbreaker*, flexed his claws in anticipation.

> "The Federation operatives have been a persistent irritant. This is our opportunity to eliminate them at their source."

> "Not just eliminate," Kraveth corrected. "Subjugate. The humans are a minor species, barely aware of the galaxy beyond their system. Their Federation is small—perhaps a few thousand operatives at most, scattered across various operations. The billions on their homeworld are defenseless."

Commander Threx of the battleship *Warbringer* leaned forward, his secondary eyelids flickering.

> "The Federation has demonstrated unusual combat effectiveness despite their limited numbers. The *Cormorant* incident—"

> "Was an ambush," Kraveth interrupted, his mandibles clicking dismissively. "A clever trap, yes. But it required preparation, positioning, and the element of surprise. We will not grant them that luxury this time."

He manipulated the display, bringing up fleet disposition data.

> "The Federation's successes stem from operating in the shadows, from choosing when and where to engage. They strike probe ships, reconnaissance elements, isolated patrols. They have never faced a dedicated battle fleet."

> "Intelligence estimates their total combat strength?" asked Captain Hresh of the carrier *Doombringer*.

> "Unknown with certainty," Kraveth admitted. "But based on observed engagements, we estimate no more than thirty to fifty combat vessels, mostly small craft. Fighters, interceptors, perhaps a handful of corvettes or light frigates. They lack the industrial base for larger capital ships."

The officers exchanged glances. By Ryzak standards, that was barely a screening force.

> "The humans themselves have no space combat capability," Kraveth continued. "Their most advanced vessels are primitive chemical rockets capable of reaching their moon. They have satellites, space stations, but nothing that qualifies as military hardware by galactic standards."

Captain Vorash's claws drummed against the tactical display's edge.

> "Then why the protected zone designation? Why does CONCORD shield them?"

> "Politics," Kraveth said, the word carrying contempt. "The Xenari sponsor them. The Seraphyn find them interesting. CONCORD maintains the fiction of protection to preserve diplomatic balance." His scales rippled with satisfaction. "But if we strike quickly, decisively, before anyone can respond? By the time CONCORD convenes to discuss sanctions, the humans will be under our control."

Commander Gresh of the cruiser squadron spoke, his voice measured.

> "The Xenari will not simply accept this. They will respond."

> "Eventually," Kraveth agreed. "But their nearest battle fleets are positioned at frontier stations, monitoring other border regions. By the time they mobilize and transit to Sol, we will have established orbital supremacy and begun ground operations. CONCORD will negotiate a settlement rather than risk open warfare between great powers."

He expanded the tactical display to show the proposed fleet composition.

> "Two combat groups. Two carriers, four battleships, four cruisers, eight destroyers, sixteen frigates. Sufficient force to overwhelm any Federation presence, establish orbital control, and begin systematic pacification of the human homeworld."

The numbers were substantial—enough firepower to reduce a planetary surface to molten slag if necessary, though subjugation was more profitable than destruction.

Captain Hresh examined the display.

> "Jump beacon protocol? The Xenari beacon will detect our approach signature."

> "The stolen keys include authentication protocols," Kraveth said. "We will transmit as Xenari vessels conducting authorized transit. By the time they realize the deception, we will already be in-system."

> "The carriers will deploy strike craft immediately upon emergence," Vorash added. "Establish combat air patrol, suppress any Federation response."

> "Battleships form the main battle line," Kraveth continued, gesturing at the display. "Cruisers provide fire support and screening. Destroyers handle escort duties and point defense. Frigates conduct reconnaissance and pursuit operations."

Commander Threx nodded slowly.

> "When do we deploy?"

> "Immediately." Kraveth's mandibles clicked with finality. "The encryption keys have a limited operational window. Intelligence estimates twenty to thirty cycles before the Xenari complete their key rotation. We must bridge into Sol system within the next twelve cycles to ensure access."

He straightened to his full height, scales reflecting the red glow of the tactical display.

> "The humans have embarrassed us through their Federation puppets for the last time. We will demonstrate what happens when a minor species dares to resist the Ryzak Empire. Earth will burn, or it will kneel. Either outcome is acceptable."

The assembled officers struck their chests in unison, the sound like thunder in the confined space.

> "For the Empire!"

> "For the Empire," Kraveth echoed. "Fleet commanders, return to your vessels. Begin jump calculations for Sol system. Target coordinates will be transmitted using the stolen authentication protocols. We deploy in six cycles."

As the officers filed out, Captain Vorash lingered.

> "Admiral, if I may—the Federation operatives have demonstrated tactical creativity that exceeds what we typically see from minor species. The *Cormorant* gambit showed sophisticated understanding of our doctrine."

Kraveth's secondary eyelids flickered—acknowledgment without agreement.

> "They are clever, yes. Resourceful. But cleverness has limits when facing overwhelming force. Two combat groups represent more firepower than they have encountered in all their previous engagements combined." He turned to face Vorash fully. "You have concerns?"

> "Caution, Admiral. Not concerns. The humans are unpredictable."

> "All prey is unpredictable when cornered," Kraveth said. "It changes nothing. We have superior numbers, superior firepower, and complete tactical surprise. The Federation cannot possibly muster a defense against this level of force, and the humans themselves are defenseless."

He gestured dismissively.

> "Return to your carrier, Captain. Prepare your strike wings. In twelve cycles, we will show the galaxy what happens to those who defy the Ryzak Empire."

Vorash saluted and departed.

Alone in the command chamber, Kraveth studied the tactical display. The Sol system hung there, small and insignificant, a single star among billions. The humans had no idea what was coming. Their Federation operatives might have won a few skirmishes, but they had never faced the full might of a Ryzak subjugation fleet.

His claws traced the orbital paths of Earth's moon, the inner planets, the gas giants beyond.

Six cycles to assembly.

Twelve cycles to deployment.

And then the humans would learn the price of resistance.

He activated his comm unit.

> "Fleet Operations, this is High Admiral Kraveth. Authorize combat group deployment. Authorization code: Warlord-Seven-Omega. Target designation: Sol system. Transit window: twelve cycles from my mark. Mark."

The response came immediately.

> "Acknowledged, Admiral. Fleet deployment authorized. All vessels moving to assembly point."

Kraveth watched the tactical display as icons began to shift, representing the massive warships beginning their coordination for jump operations. Two carriers, each capable of deploying hundreds of strike craft. Four battleships, mobile fortresses with enough firepower to crack planetary shields. The supporting vessels, each deadly in their own right.

The Federation had won battles.

The Ryzak Empire would win the war.

Earth's fate was already sealed.

### Galileo Station

The Federation station orbited Jupiter at a precisely calculated distance, hidden among the electromagnetic chaos of the gas giant's radiation belts. From the outside, Galileo Station appeared as little more than an irregularly shaped asteroid, its surface pitted and scarred, tumbling slowly in its orbit. The disguise was deliberate and effective. Earth's astronomers had catalogued it decades ago as minor body J2007-447, unremarkable and uninteresting.

Inside, the station housed the Federation's primary command center for Sol system operations. Three hundred personnel, mostly human with a handful of Xenari advisors, maintained constant watch over Earth's orbital space, coordinated covert operations planetside, and served as the communication relay to the wider galaxy.

Commander Sarah Chen stood in the operations center, her eyes fixed on the priority message that had just come through on the Xenari secure channel. The text was clinical, precise, and terrifying.

**PRIORITY ALPHA / XENARI FLEET COMMAND**
**TO: FEDERATION SOL STATION**
**CLASSIFICATION: CRITICAL THREAT**

**ENCRYPTION KEYS COMPROMISED. RYZAK INTELLIGENCE OPERATION CONFIRMED. EXPECT HOSTILE INCURSION SOL SYSTEM VIA JUMP BEACON. ESTIMATED FORCE: TWO COMBAT GROUPS, THIRTY-FOUR VESSELS. ESTIMATED TIME TO ARRIVAL: 8-14 CYCLES (18-32 HOURS EARTH STANDARD).**

**XENARI RESPONSE FLEETS MOBILIZING BUT CANNOT ARRIVE IN TIME TO ESTABLISH DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. KRYLLIAN PARTNERS HAVE RELEASED FEDERATION ASSETS FROM JOINT OPERATIONS. TRANSIT TIME TO SOL: MINIMUM 48 HOURS.**

**YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.**

**RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE DEFENSIVE PREPARATIONS. PROTECT HUMAN HOMEWORLD AT ALL COSTS.**

**XENARI FLEET COMMAND SENDS THEIR REGARDS AND THEIR APOLOGIES.**

Chen read it twice, her hands steady despite the ice forming in her gut. Eighteen years in the Federation, from a junior analyst to station commander, and she'd never seen a message quite like this.

> "Commander?"

She turned. Lieutenant Marcus Webb, her operations officer, stood at the tactical display, his face pale.

> "I'm reading the same message," he said quietly. "Ma'am, we have forty-two operational combat vessels in-system. Mostly Talons, a squadron of Wraiths, three corvettes. Against two Ryzak combat groups?"

Chen moved to the tactical display, where the Sol system hung in miniature, each Federation asset marked in blue. The numbers were stark. Forty-two vessels against thirty-four sounded almost even, until you factored in that the Ryzak force included two carriers with hundreds of strike craft, plus battleships that massed more than the entire Federation presence combined.

> "Pull up fleet disposition," she said. "Everything we have, operational or not."

Webb's fingers moved across the interface. Icons appeared throughout the inner system.

> "Talons: thirty-one operational, four in maintenance at Lunar Base. Wraiths: eight operational, two undergoing refit. Corvettes: three. The destroyer *Sentinel* is in dock at Station One for engine replacement. The frigate *Resolute* is on patrol in the asteroid belt but her shields are running at sixty percent. And we have the station's defensive platforms."

He paused, expanding the view to show Jupiter orbit.

> "Jovian Shipyards has three battleships. The *Typhoon* is fully operational. The *Lord Cardigan* and *Gallipoli* are both in mid-refit—weapons systems offline, shield generators being replaced, crew at half-strength."

> "Defensive platforms won't matter," Chen said flatly. "Ryzak battleships will crack them in the opening salvo. *Sentinel* can't maneuver without engines. And two battleships in refit aren't much better than scrap metal."

She studied the display, her mind racing through scenarios. Every simulation, every tactical briefing, every war game she'd participated in over the years. None of them had modeled this scenario. The Federation had always assumed the Xenari would maintain control of the jump beacon, that any Ryzak incursion would be detected and intercepted before reaching Sol.

> "What about the assets the Xenari mentioned?" Webb asked. "Our fleets operating with the Kryllians?"

> "Too far out," Chen said. "Even with immediate jump clearance, they're looking at forty-eight hours minimum transit time. The Ryzak will be here in eighteen to thirty-two hours."

> "So we fight."

> "We fight," Chen agreed. "But not alone."

Webb's eyes widened slightly.

> "You're talking about Earth."

> "I'm talking about Earth," Chen confirmed. She activated the station-wide comm. "All senior staff to Operations immediately. This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill."

Within three minutes, the operations center filled with personnel. Her XO, Lieutenant Commander James Rodriguez. Chief Engineer Patricia O'Connor. Intelligence Officer Captain David Sung. Tactical Coordinator Major Elena Petrov. And two others—the station's AI liaisons, Lieutenant Sarah Martinez and Commander Thomas Reeves.

> "Priority message from Xenari Fleet Command," Chen said without preamble. "Ryzak incursion expected within eighteen to thirty-two hours. Two combat groups. Thirty-four vessels including carriers and battleships."

The silence was absolute.

> "Our response assets?" Rodriguez asked, his voice carefully controlled.

> "Insufficient," Chen said. "Even if we pull every operational vessel, every fighter, every platform, we're outgunned by a factor of ten. The Ryzak carriers alone can deploy enough strike craft to overwhelm our point defense."

> "Federation reinforcements?" O'Connor asked.

> "Forty-eight hours minimum. The Ryzak will be here in less than half that time."

Major Petrov leaned forward, her hands flat on the tactical display.

> "Then we need to call in the markers."

Chen nodded slowly. Over the past five years, the Federation had quietly transferred advanced technology to several Earth governments. Portugal's Talons. The Japanese trials. The American integration program. NATO pilot training. It had been done carefully, incrementally, preparing Earth for the day when the truth about the galaxy could no longer be hidden.

That day had arrived ahead of schedule.

> "If we activate Earth's assets," Rodriguez said carefully, "we expose the Federation. We expose everything we've been building. The secrecy, the careful introduction of technology—it all ends."

> "It ends anyway when Ryzak battleships start bombarding population centers," Petrov countered. "We can manage the diplomatic fallout later. Right now, we need every available combat asset."

Captain Sung pulled up intelligence assessments.

> "Portugal has twenty-five Talons operational or near-operational. The Japanese have sixteen. The Americans have eight fully integrated plus another twelve in advanced training. That's sixty-one additional fighters if we can coordinate deployment."

> "And the political implications?" Rodriguez asked. "We're talking about revealing alien contact to the entire planet. Mass panic, government destabilization, religious upheaval—"

> "All of which is preferable to extinction," Chen interrupted. Her voice was quiet but carried absolute certainty. "We can manage panic. We can manage political fallout. We cannot manage a Ryzak occupation."

She straightened, her decision made.

> "Lieutenant Martinez, Commander Reeves. Contact HARBINGER and SUNTZU. I need strategic analysis and coordination protocols. We're going to war, and we're going to need every advantage we can manufacture."

The two AI liaisons moved to their stations. Within seconds, the holographic displays flickered to life with two distinct presences.

HARBINGER materialized first—a shifting geometric pattern that suggested rather than depicted a humanoid form, rendered in cool blues and silvers. The AI's voice was calm, almost soothing, with a faint electronic undertone.

> "Commander Chen. I have reviewed the Xenari warning. Situation assessment: critical. Probability of successful defense without additional assets: twelve percent."

> "We're calling Earth," Chen said. "Full activation of all transferred assets. I need you to coordinate communications with the governments involved. Portugal, Japan, United States. Anyone else who has operational hardware."

> "Acknowledged. Recommendation: immediate notification to all parties. Optimal scenario requires eighteen hours minimum preparation time for coordinated response."

SUNTZU manifested beside HARBINGER, its form more angular, aggressive, rendered in deep reds and golds. Where HARBINGER suggested patience and coordination, SUNTZU embodied decisive action.

> "Fleet disposition analysis complete," SUNTZU said, its voice deeper, more resonant. "Ryzak force composition suggests orbital superiority doctrine followed by ground assault. They will attempt to establish space control before engaging surface targets. This provides tactical opportunity."

> "Explain," Chen said.

> "Ryzak doctrine prioritizes destroying orbital assets before surface bombardment. They will engage Federation vessels first. This provides window for Earth forces to deploy and establish defensive positions. If we coordinate emergence points, we can create multiple engagement zones, prevent Ryzak fleet from concentrating firepower."

HARBINGER's geometric pattern shifted, incorporating SUNTZU's tactical data.

> "Strategic synthesis: Federation forces engage immediately upon Ryzak emergence, draw their attention. Earth forces deploy from planetary surface once Ryzak commit to engagement vectors. Multi-vector attack complicates Ryzak targeting solutions, forces them to divide capital ship fire support."

> "It's still a long shot," Rodriguez said quietly.

> "Twelve percent without Earth assets," HARBINGER confirmed. "Forty-one percent with full Earth deployment and optimal coordination. However, Commander, may I reframe the tactical objective?"

Chen looked at the AI's shifting geometric form.

> "Go ahead."

> "Federation reinforcements arrive in forty-eight hours," HARBINGER said. "The Ryzak arrive in eighteen to thirty-two hours. Our objective is not to defeat two combat groups. Our objective is to stall them for sixteen to eighteen hours. Once Federation battle fleets arrive, the Ryzak force becomes tactically untenable."

SUNTZU's angular form pulsed agreement.

> "Correct tactical assessment. We do not need to win. We need to survive. Ryzak doctrine emphasizes decisive engagement. If we deny them quick victory, force extended combat, reduce their strategic momentum—Federation reinforcements will arrive with overwhelming force."

SUNTZU's form flickered as it processed additional data.

> "Additional strategic asset: Jovian Shipyards. Two battleships currently in refit status. If we prioritize emergency deployment protocols, rush critical systems online, we can deploy *Lord Cardigan* and *Gallipoli* approximately three to four hours after Ryzak emergence. They will not be optimal—reduced crew efficiency, secondary systems incomplete—but operational battleship-grade firepower."

> "And *Typhoon*?" Chen asked.

> "Fully operational. Can take defensive position immediately. Three battleships alter Ryzak tactical calculus significantly. Their carriers will need to dedicate strike craft to capital ship suppression rather than fighter superiority, and their battleships will need to primary ours, leaving them unable to engage the station or smaller vessels."

> "Probability of survival for sixteen hours?" Chen asked.

> "With Earth assets and optimal coordination: seventy-three percent," HARBINGER said. "The timeline favors defense. Every hour we hold reduces Ryzak tactical options and increases probability of reinforcement arrival."

Chen looked at the faces around her. These people had trained for this moment, had dedicated their lives to protecting Earth from threats the planet didn't even know existed. Now the bill had come due.

> "HARBINGER, draft priority communications to all Earth governments with active technology transfers. Authorization code Chen-Alpha-Seven. Tell them the truth. Tell them we're out of time. And tell them we need every pilot, every aircraft, every weapons system they can put in space within eighteen hours."

> "SUNTZU, begin strategic coordination. I want defensive positions, engagement zones, fall-back vectors. We're not trying to destroy them. We're trying to hold them for sixteen hours until our reinforcements arrive. Design the defense accordingly."

Both AIs pulsed acknowledgment.

> "Commander Chen," HARBINGER said, its voice carrying unusual weight, "this action will fundamentally alter Earth's relationship with the galaxy. There is no returning to secrecy once this begins."

> "I know," Chen said quietly. "But better Earth knows the truth and survives than dies in ignorance."

SUNTZU's angular form shifted, a gesture that might have been approval.

> "The enemy has chosen the time and place of this battle. We will choose how it is fought. Beginning strategic coordination now."

Chen turned back to the tactical display, watching as SUNTZU began plotting defensive positions, engagement vectors, fallback lines. Somewhere out there, a Ryzak fleet was preparing to jump. Earth didn't know they were coming. The governments she was about to contact would have less than a day to process the existence of aliens, absorb the reality of an invasion, and deploy their forces.

It should have been impossible.

But they didn't need to win. They just needed to survive long enough for help to arrive.

> "All hands," she said into the station comm, her voice carrying throughout Galileo Station. "Battle stations. This is not a drill. Ryzak incursion expected within thirty-two hours. We are going to defensive posture Alpha. And we are calling Earth."

She closed the comm and looked at her staff.

> "We've spent twenty years preparing Earth for first contact. We just ran out of time for a gentle introduction. HARBINGER, send the messages. SUNTZU, coordinate our response. Everyone else—let's figure out how we're going to hold off two Ryzak combat groups for sixteen hours."

HARBINGER's form pulsed once.

> "Messages transmitting on all secure channels. Priority Alpha authorization. Earth governments will receive notification within the hour."

> "And God help us all," Rodriguez muttered.

Chen didn't respond. She was watching the countdown timer that SUNTZU had placed on the main display.

**ESTIMATED RYZAK ARRIVAL: 27 HOURS, 43 MINUTES**

The clock was running. Out in the galaxy, Federation ships were warping gate-to-gate, rushing to the closest available jump bridge to get them home. Somewhere, a Ryzak supercarrier was already spooling to create a wormhole bridging lightyears to drop their ships into Sol. On Earth, phones would soon start to ring, and high-ranking people would be getting some unexpected visits. The dice were cast and the pieces dropping into place.

Earth's awakening had begun.

## Chapter 2: Wakeup Call

### The White House

President Donald Trump was not in a good mood.

He'd been asleep for maybe three hours when the Secret Service detail burst into the residence, their urgency cutting through the usual protocols. No apologies, no explanations, just firm hands guiding him toward hastily provided clothes and insistent voices repeating that he needed to come with them immediately.

Now, at 3:47 AM, he stalked down the corridor toward the Situation Room, still buttoning his shirt, flanked by agents whose expressions told him this wasn't a drill and wasn't negotiable. Chief of Staff Susie Wiles hurried alongside him, her phone pressed to her ear, her face pale.

> "What is this about?" Trump demanded. "Russia? China? Talk to me, Susie."

> "Sir, I don't—they won't say. The Joint Chiefs are already in the Situation Room. They said you needed to see it yourself."

> "At four in the morning? This better be good."

The door to the Situation Room stood open, light spilling into the hallway. Trump could hear that voice—HARBINGER's distinctive gravelly electronic tone—and his expression shifted. He'd been briefed on the AI before, knew what it represented. If HARBINGER was on every screen at this hour, something had gone very wrong.

He pushed through the door.

The room was packed. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Charles Brown stood at the head of the table, his uniform crisp despite the hour. Around him, the other service chiefs occupied their usual positions—General Randy George from the Army, Admiral Lisa Franchetti from the Navy, General David Allvin from the Air Force, General Eric Smith from the Marines, and General Michael Guetlein from Space Force. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stood near the wall, his expression grim.

Every screen in the room showed HARBINGER's shifting geometric form, rendered in cool blues and silvers. The AI's voice filled the space, mid-sentence when Trump entered.

> "—critical that all available assets reach orbital deployment positions within eighteen hours. Each hour of delay reduces defensive probability by approximately seven percent."

The geometric form pulsed once as Trump entered, acknowledging his presence.

> "Mr. President."

> "HARBINGER." Trump moved to his chair but didn't sit, his hands flat on the table. "I'm guessing this isn't a drill."

> "Correct, Mr. President. Twenty-three hours ago, hostile forces acquired unauthorized access to the jump beacon in this system. We are facing an imminent invasion. Estimated arrival: twenty-six hours."

The main display shifted. The geometric pattern moved to a corner window while the center screen showed a star map. Earth at the center, Jupiter's orbit marked beyond. And near Jupiter, a cluster of red icons multiplying rapidly.

> "Two Ryzak combat groups. Thirty-four capital ships. Two carriers deploying six hundred strike craft, four battleships, supporting vessels. This is a subjugation fleet, Mr. President. They intend to establish orbital control and occupy Earth."

Trump's jaw tightened. He looked at General Brown.

> "Charlie?"

> "Sir, we've reviewed the tactical assessment. It's credible. The threat is real."

> "Okay. Okay." Trump's hands gestured as he processed. "So we've got—what, twenty-six hours before these things show up? And they're coming here? To Earth?"

> "Correct, Mr. President."

> "And what do we have to stop them? Don't sugarcoat it."

HARBINGER's form pulsed.

> "The Federation has forty-two operational combat vessels in-system. Against this force, survival probability is twelve percent. However, if we deploy all available Earth assets—the Talons we previously provided to the United States, Portugal, Japan, and other nations—survival probability increases to seventy-three percent."

> "Seventy-three. That's better than twelve, I can tell you that." Trump turned to General Allvin. "Dave, the Talons. How many do we have operational?"

> "Sir, eight fully mission-capable at Groom Lake. Twelve more in advanced training status at Edwards, Nellis, and Ellington. If we push it, we can have all twenty ready for deployment."

> "Then we push it." Trump looked back at HARBINGER. "What else?"

> "Portugal has twenty-five Talons operational or near-operational. Japan has sixteen. Combined with Federation assets and optimal coordination, we can field sufficient force to hold the Ryzak for approximately sixteen hours."

> "Hold them? Not beat them?"

> "Federation reinforcements are en route from allied systems, Mr. President. Arrival time: forty-eight hours. Our objective is not to defeat two combat groups. Our objective is to survive long enough for overwhelming reinforcements to arrive. Sixteen hours of sustained defense will force the Ryzak into an untenable position."

General Smith leaned forward.

> "What's to stop them from just bombarding population centers from orbit?"

> "Ryzak doctrine prioritizes subjugation over destruction," HARBINGER replied. "Dead worlds have no economic value. They will attempt to establish space control first, neutralize defensive assets, then begin ground operations. However, if resistance proves too costly, they are capable of bombardment."

Admiral Franchetti's hands were flat on the table.

> "Sir, our Navy assets can't reach orbital altitude. This fight happens in space. We're dependent on the Air Force and Space Force assets."

> "The Talons," Trump said. He turned back to HARBINGER. "You're telling me we need every single one of those aircraft in the fight. All twenty of ours, all twenty-five from Portugal, all sixteen from Japan. Everything."

> "Correct, Mr. President. Your pilots will operate under strategic and tactical guidance from Federation command structure, but deployment authority remains with national militaries. This is an Earth defense operation."

> "Good. That's good." Trump's hands moved as he spoke. "We're not handing over command to some—no offense—to some computer. Our pilots, our aircraft, we're coordinating but we're flying them."

> "Understood, Mr. President. I will provide targeting data, threat assessment, and tactical recommendations. Your pilots execute."

General Guetlein spoke up.

> "Sir, the training squadrons—those pilots aren't fully certified yet. We'd be pushing them into combat ahead of schedule."

> "Then we push them." Trump's tone left no room for argument. "Dave, can they fly the aircraft?"

General Allvin nodded.

> "Yes, sir. They're qualified on the systems. They're just not fully mission-ready by peacetime standards."

> "Well, this isn't peacetime, is it? Get them ready." Trump looked around the table. "What else do we need? What am I missing here?"

Trump moved to the display, studying the red icons clustered near Jupiter.

> "So let me get this straight. We've got twenty-six hours. These Ryzak—bad guys, very bad guys—they're coming to take over Earth. We've got seventy-three percent odds if we use everything we have. And if we don't, we're looking at twelve percent."

> "Correct, Mr. President."

> "Twelve percent." Trump shook his head. "That's terrible. That's the worst odds I've ever heard. We're not doing twelve percent."

He turned back to the table.

> "Okay. Here's what we're doing. General Allvin, you get every single Talon pilot we have—I don't care if they're at Groom Lake, Edwards, Nellis, wherever—you get them ready to fly. All twenty aircraft, all twenty pilots. They're going into space, they're going to fight, and they're going to win."

> "Yes, sir."

> "General Brown, I want you coordinating with HARBINGER here on overall strategy. But our people fly our aircraft, understood? We're not giving up command."

> "Understood, sir."

> "Admiral, I know the Navy can't fight in space, but you've got logistics, you've got support capability. Whatever the Air Force and Space Force need, you make sure they get it."

> "Yes, Mr. President."

Trump's hands moved as he spoke, emphasizing each point.

> "Now, Congress. We need to brief the leadership. Mike Johnson, Chuck Schumer, the intelligence chairs—"

> "Mr. President," HARBINGER interrupted, "I am already initiating contact with all members of Congress, as well as the governments of Portugal, Japan, and other nations fielding Talon assets. Simultaneous briefings are more efficient given the time constraints."

Trump paused, then nodded.

> "Okay. Good. That's good. You do that. But Charlie—" he pointed at General Brown, "—I want our people talking to their people too. Government to government. This isn't just some AI telling everyone what to do. This is the United States coordinating with our allies on a defense operation."

> "Yes, sir. I'll have State Department protocols initiated immediately."

> "Susie," Trump turned to Wiles, "start working on a public statement. We may need to tell people what's happening before this is over. Keep it simple. Keep it calm. We don't want panic, but we're not lying to them either."

Wiles nodded, already making notes.

Trump looked back at HARBINGER's geometric form.

> "One more thing. These odds you're giving me—seventy-three percent. That's if everything goes perfectly, right? If all our allies show up, if all the pilots perform, if nothing goes wrong."

> "Correct, Mr. President. That calculation assumes optimal coordination and performance."

> "Well, nothing ever goes perfectly. You know that, I know that. So what are we really looking at here? Give it to me straight."

The geometric form pulsed, considering.

> "Realistic probability, accounting for friction, communications delays, and combat variables: approximately sixty-one percent survival probability. Still substantially better than twelve percent without Earth assets."

> "Sixty-one. Okay." Trump's jaw set. "I've won with worse odds. We're doing this."

He turned to face his assembled military leadership.

> "Ladies and gentlemen, we've got twenty-six hours to prepare for the biggest fight in human history. These Ryzak think we're primitives, think we're easy targets. They're about to find out they made a big mistake. A huge mistake. We're going to show them what Americans can do. What humanity can do."

He pointed at the display.

> "HARBINGER, you have full authorization to coordinate with our military. Provide them whatever they need—intelligence, targeting data, tactical recommendations. But our people are flying those aircraft, and we're defending our planet. Got it?"

> "Understood, Mr. President. Coordination protocols are already active."

> "Good. Very good." Trump looked around the room one more time. "Get moving, all of you. General Brown, I want updates every hour. Not every two hours, not every three hours—every hour. And somebody get me coffee. It's going to be a long day."

He strode from the Situation Room, Wiles scrambling to keep up. Behind him, the Joint Chiefs were already moving, phones out, orders being issued. On every screen, HARBINGER's geometric form pulsed steady blue-silver, coordinating simultaneous briefings across multiple governments, preparing Earth's defense.

### Monte Real Air Base, Portugal

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas's phone had rung at 8:23 AM local time. The voice on the other end was clipped, urgent, and offered no explanation beyond three words: "Report immediately. Priority Alpha."

Now, at 9:15 AM, he stood in the secure briefing room at Monte Real Air Base alongside nineteen other Talon pilots, all summoned with the same cryptic message. General António Silva, Commander of the Portuguese Air Force, stood at the head of the room with Defense Minister Nuno Melo. Both men looked like they'd been awake for hours.

Every screen in the room displayed the same thing: a shifting geometric pattern in blue and silver that pulsed with an almost organic rhythm.

Miguel had never seen anything like it.

> "Attention," General Silva said, his voice cutting through the low murmur of confused pilots. "What you are about to hear is classified at the highest level. As of this moment, you are all under operational security protocols. No communications outside this room without authorization."

The room fell silent.

> "I am HARBINGER," the voice from the speakers said, deep and electronic with that distinctive gravelly quality. "I am an artificial intelligence deployed by the EarthSpace Federation. For those unfamiliar with the Federation, you have been flying their technology for the past three years. The Talons you operate were provided to Portugal as part of a broader preparation initiative."

Miguel exchanged glances with Captain Teresa Ramos beside him. They'd been told the Talons were experimental aircraft developed through international partnership. Not that they were built with alien technology.

> "Twenty-three hours ago," HARBINGER continued, "hostile extraterrestrial forces acquired unauthorized access to a jump beacon in this solar system. A Ryzak subjugation fleet—thirty-four capital ships including two carriers deploying six hundred strike craft—will arrive in approximately twenty-six hours. Their objective is the occupation of Earth."

The silence in the room became absolute. Miguel felt his heart hammering. This had to be some kind of test. Some elaborate training scenario.

But General Silva's expression said otherwise.

The display shifted, showing a tactical map of the solar system. Red icons clustered near Jupiter, growing in number.

> "The Federation has forty-two operational combat vessels currently in-system. Against the incoming Ryzak force, survival probability is twelve percent. However, Portugal currently has twenty-five Talon interceptors operational or near-operational status. If deployed in coordination with Federation forces and other Earth nations, survival probability increases to seventy-three percent."

> "You're asking us to fight aliens," Captain Ramos said, her voice steady despite the absurdity of the statement. "In space."

> "Correct, Captain Ramos. The Talons you have been training in are hybrid atmospheric-space superiority fighters. You have logged hundreds of hours in high-altitude intercept scenarios, orbital insertion maneuvers, and zero-gravity combat protocols. Your training was designed specifically for this contingency."

Miguel's mind raced through the past three years. The unusual flight profiles. The sealed orders. The simulation scenarios that always seemed just slightly beyond realistic. They'd been preparing for this without knowing it.

> "General Silva," HARBINGER said, "I am making similar requests to the United States, Japan, and other nations currently fielding Talon assets. This is not a Federation operation. This is an Earth defense operation. Your pilots will operate under Portuguese command, with strategic and tactical coordination provided by Federation resources. Deployment authority remains with your government."

General Silva stepped forward, his hands clasped behind his back.

> "Defense Minister Melo and I have been in contact with the Prime Minister. Portugal has a decision to make, and we have very little time to make it." He looked at the assembled pilots. "This is not about NATO. This is not about European defense. This is about the survival of our species."

He turned to face HARBINGER's geometric form.

> "You're asking us to commit our entire operational Talon force. All twenty-five aircraft. Every pilot we have trained. If we do this, Portugal will have no strategic air defense assets remaining."

> "Correct, General. However, if the Ryzak establish orbital control, Portuguese air defense assets become irrelevant. They will bombard from space with impunity. There will be no Air Force to defend because there will be no Portugal to defend."

The bluntness of the statement hit like a physical blow. Miguel saw it register on every face in the room.

> "What are our chances?" Defense Minister Melo asked. "Really."

> "With full deployment of all available Earth assets and optimal coordination: sixty-one percent survival probability accounting for combat variables and friction. Without Earth forces, the Federation fleet will be overwhelmed in approximately four hours of sustained combat. The Ryzak will then proceed with orbital bombardment and ground invasion unopposed."

> "And if we survive the sixteen hours you mentioned?"

> "Federation reinforcements arrive with overwhelming force. The Ryzak fleet will be forced to retreat or face destruction. Earth remains free."

General Silva was quiet for a long moment, studying the tactical display. Then he turned to face his pilots.

> "I need to know, right now, who is willing to fly this mission. This is voluntary. No one will be forced into combat against an alien invasion force. But I need to know who will stand with me."

Miguel didn't hesitate. His hand went up.

Around the room, nineteen other hands followed.

General Silva nodded slowly, something like pride crossing his features.

> "Very well." He turned back to HARBINGER. "Portugal will deploy all twenty-five Talons. But understand this—these are Portuguese pilots flying Portuguese aircraft in defense of Earth. We coordinate with your Federation, but we do not take orders from an AI."

> "Understood, General Silva. I will provide threat assessment, targeting data, and tactical recommendations. Your pilots execute according to Portuguese command authority. Coordination protocols are being established now with all participating nations."

> "When do we deploy?"

> "All Talon forces must reach orbital deployment positions within eighteen hours. I am transmitting assembly coordinates now. Portuguese forces will integrate with Federation defensive formations in Sector Seven, covering European and African orbital approaches."

The tactical display updated, showing orbital paths, defensive positions, and coordination points with other national forces.

> "Eighteen hours," General Silva said. "We need pre-flight checks, weapons loading, pilot briefings, coordination with ground support—"

> "All technical specifications and coordination protocols are being transmitted to your maintenance teams now," HARBINGER said. "Federation logistics personnel are en route to Monte Real to assist with preparation. They will arrive in forty-seven minutes."

Miguel caught Captain Ramos's eye. She looked as stunned as he felt.

> "One more thing," General Silva said. "Our pilots need to know what they're facing. What are these Ryzak? What are their capabilities?"

The display shifted again, showing what could only be described as a nightmare rendered in tactical data. Reptilian forms in heavy armor. Weapons specifications. Ship classifications.

> "The Ryzak are an aggressive militaristic species," HARBINGER said. "They have conquered dozens of civilizations through superior firepower and ruthless tactics. They do not negotiate. They do not retreat unless facing overwhelming force. And they view humanity as primitives requiring subjugation."

> "They're about to learn otherwise," Captain Ramos said quietly.

> "Correct, Captain. That is precisely what they are about to learn."

General Silva turned back to his pilots.

> "You have two hours to contact your families. Tell them you're being deployed. Do not—I repeat, do not—tell them where or why. After that, we begin mission prep. Maintenance teams are being briefed separately. We have eighteen hours to prepare for the most important mission in human history."

He paused, looking at each pilot in turn.

> "Portugal has always stood against tyranny. Today, we stand not just for Portugal, not just for Europe, but for Earth itself. Make your calls. Then let's get to work."

The pilots began filing out, voices rising in urgent conversation. Miguel lingered, staring at the tactical display. Somewhere out there, beyond Jupiter, a hostile fleet was preparing to jump into their system.

He thought of his sister in Lisbon. His parents in Porto. His girlfriend who thought he was just a regular fighter pilot flying regular missions.

In eighteen hours, he'd be flying into space to fight aliens.

The world had just changed, and most people didn't even know it yet.

> "Lieutenant Freitas," HARBINGER's voice came through the speakers, addressing him directly. "Your flight performance records indicate exceptional skill in high-velocity intercept scenarios. I am assigning you as element leader for Strike Package Delta. You will coordinate four Talons in close support of Federation corvette operations."

Miguel straightened, looking at the geometric form on the screen.

> "Understood. I won't let you down."

> "I have analyzed your training records, Lieutenant. I do not believe you will. Coordination briefing begins in ninety minutes. Use your time wisely."

The screen went dark.

Miguel pulled out his phone and stared at it for a long moment before dialing. His sister answered on the third ring, her voice clear and alert.

> "Miguel? What's going on? You never call this early."

> "I know. I'm sorry. I just… I needed to hear your voice. I'm being deployed."

> "Deployed? Where?"

He looked at the now-dark screens, at the empty briefing room, at the future that had just arrived twenty-six hours early.

> "I can't say. Just… tell Mom and Dad I love them. And Maria. Tell her I'll call when I can."

> "Miguel, you're scaring me. What's happening?"

> "I have to go. Just remember—whatever happens, whatever you hear in the next few days—I'm doing my job. We're all doing our jobs. And it matters. It matters more than anything."

He ended the call before she could respond, before he could say something that would violate operational security. Before he could tell her that in twenty-six hours, Earth would be at war.

He had eighteen hours to prepare.

Time to get to work.

### Jovian Shipyards

The shipyards hung in orbit above Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere, a sprawling network of construction frames, docking clamps, and pressurized work modules. Normally, the facility operated on carefully planned schedules, with maintenance crews working standard shifts on vessels that had months to reach operational status.

Now, every light in the facility burned at maximum intensity, and over three hundred personnel swarmed over three Federation battleships like ants on a carcass.

Chief Engineer Marcus Webb stood in the command center overlooking Bay Seven, where the destroyer *Sentinel* sat clamped in her maintenance frame. Through the transparent aluminum viewport, he could see the ship's exposed engine compartment, a gaping wound in her stern where the main drive assembly should have been.

> "Status on the engine swap," he said into his comm.

> "We've got the Kryllian surplus drive unit moving into position now," came the response from Lieutenant Sarah Chen, currently suited up and coordinating the external teams. "It's not pretty, Chief. This thing is forty percent larger than the original spec."

> "Will it fit?"

> "We're making it fit. Cutting away structural members now. We'll reinforce with emergency bracing, but this is going to compromise the hull integrity around the engine mount."

Marcus pulled up the engineering schematics on his display. The Kryllian drive was indeed oversized, designed for a heavy freighter rather than a destroyer. But it would generate thrust, and right now that was all that mattered.

> "How long until it's installed?"

> "Twelve hours if everything goes perfectly. Fourteen realistically."

> "You have ten. Cut every corner that won't kill the crew. We need *Sentinel* mobile."

There was a pause.

> "Understood, Chief. We'll get it done."

Marcus switched channels, looking across the facility to Bay Three, where the battleship *Gallipoli* sat in her refit cradle. Unlike *Sentinel*, her engines were functional. The problem was her weapons.

> "Bay Three, this is Webb. Give me an update on *Gallipoli*'s main batteries."

> "Webb, this is Commander Patricia Hayes." Her voice carried the strain of someone who'd been working for six hours straight. "We've got the port-side railgun array back online. Starboard array is another story—the targeting systems are completely stripped for overhaul. We're pulling components from *Lord Cardigan* to get them operational."

> "What about the missile tubes?"

> "Four forward tubes are loaded and operational. The broadside launchers are empty—we don't have munitions for them. We sent that entire stock back to supply three weeks ago for inspection."

Marcus's jaw tightened. A battleship with half her weapons offline was better than a battleship that couldn't fight at all, but not by much.

> "Can you get the starboard railguns online?"

> "Maybe. We're literally cannibalizing *Lord Cardigan*'s fire control systems. If we prioritize *Gallipoli*, we can probably have both railgun arrays functional in eight hours. But that means *Cardigan* will be firing manually."

> "Do it. *Gallipoli* needs to be our primary gunship. And Hayes—transfer *Cardigan*'s torpedo stock to *Gallipoli* while you're at it. If *Gallipoli* has working fire control, she needs the munitions to use it."

> "Understood. That'll give us full broadside capability once the transfer is complete."

He switched channels again, this time to Bay Five where the battleship *Lord Cardigan* sat silent and dark, her shields completely offline.

> "Bay Five, Webb. Where are we on the shield generators?"

> "Chief, this is Lieutenant Yuki Tanaka." The young engineer's voice was tight with stress. "We've got a problem. The primary generator array is completely disassembled. We're talking about three weeks of work minimum to get it back online properly."

> "We don't have three weeks. We have hours."

> "I know, sir. So here's what we're doing—we're pulling the shield generators from the freighter *Abundant Hope* in Bay Twelve. They're civilian-grade, about sixty percent the output of military spec, but they'll work."

> "How long?"

> "The generators themselves we can install in four hours. But the power conduits are a nightmare. We're having to jury-rig connections because the civilian units don't match our military hardpoints. We're using emergency clamps and bypass routing. It's ugly, sir."

> "Will it hold?"

There was a pause.

> "Honestly? I don't know. The connections aren't rated for combat stress. If *Cardigan* takes a hard hit, we could lose shields entirely. Or the feedback could fry the generators. Or—"

> "Lieutenant." Marcus's voice cut through the spiral. "Will you have shields up in ten hours?"

> "Yes, sir. Some shields. Sixty percent coverage, maybe less. And they might fail if we take concentrated fire."

> "Then that's what we work with. Get it done."

> "Aye, sir. And Chief? The gunners should know—without fire control, they're going to be eyeballing their shots. No targeting solutions, no ballistic computers. Just iron sights and Kentucky windage against moving targets in three-dimensional space."

Marcus closed his eyes briefly. Battleship railguns firing manually against Ryzak warships. It was barely better than throwing rocks.

> "Understood. I'll make sure the gunnery crews know what they're getting into. Webb out."

Marcus closed the channel and stared out at the three battleships. *Typhoon* sat in Bay One, fully operational, her crew already aboard running combat drills. She was ready. But *Sentinel* had no engines, *Gallipoli* had half her weapons offline, and *Lord Cardigan* was being held together with spit, prayer, and jury-rigged civilian shields.

And in less than twenty-six hours, all four vessels would be facing two Ryzak combat groups.

His comm chirped. Commander Sarah Chen from Galileo Station.

> "Chief Webb, this is Station Command. Status update?"

> "Commander, we're working miracles out here, but they're messy miracles. *Sentinel* will be mobile but compromised. *Gallipoli* will have weapons but we had to cannibalize *Cardigan*'s fire control to make it work. *Cardigan* will have shields but they're jury-rigged civilian units, and her gunners will be firing manually—eyeballing shots against moving targets."

> "What's your confidence level?"

Marcus looked at the ships again. At the workers swarming over them, cutting, welding, installing, testing. At the sparks of cutting torches and the glow of welding arcs. At three hundred people who hadn't slept and wouldn't sleep until the job was done.

> "Commander, if we were doing this by the book, I'd say zero confidence. We're violating every safety protocol, every engineering standard, every regulation in the manual. Any inspector would shut us down immediately."

> "But?"

> "But my people are the best in the Federation. They're working with fire in their bellies and no margin for error. We'll have three battleships ready for combat. They won't be pretty, and they won't be perfect, but they'll fight."

> "That's all we need, Chief. How can Station support you?"

> "Send us every spare power cell you have. Every weapons component. Every shield emitter. Hell, send us *Cardigan*'s entire torpedo magazine—we're transferring it to *Gallipoli* since she's got the working fire control. And coffee. Lots of coffee."

> "Already on the way. And Chief?"

> "Yes, ma'am?"

> "Thank your people for me. They're buying Earth time to live."

> "I will, ma'am. Webb out."

He opened the facility-wide channel.

> "All hands, this is Chief Webb. I know you're tired. I know you're working beyond anything we've ever asked of you. But I need you to know what's at stake here." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "In less than a day, a hostile fleet will arrive at Jupiter. They're coming to take Earth. To occupy our home. To subjugate our families."

Across the facility, he saw workers pause, looking up at the speakers.

> "The four ships we're working on right now—they're not just metal and circuits. They're the difference between Earth remaining free and Earth falling to an alien empire. Every weld you complete, every system you bring online, every shortcut you make work—you're saving lives. You're protecting families. You're defending everything we've built."

He looked at *Sentinel*'s exposed engines, at *Cardigan*'s weapon arrays, at *Gallipoli*'s emergency shield installation.

> "We have ten hours to finish what we started. Ten hours to give these ships a fighting chance. I know it's not enough time. I know we're asking the impossible. But I also know that every single person in this facility is capable of miracles when they need to be."

He paused.

> "So let's show these Ryzak bastards what human engineering can do when our backs are against the wall. Let's give them four battleships they'll never forget. Now get back to work—we've got a deadline."

The response came not in words but in renewed activity. Cutting torches flared brighter. Welding arcs intensified. Suited figures moved with fresh urgency across the hulls.

Marcus turned back to his displays, pulling up the master timeline. Ten hours to complete three separate emergency refit operations simultaneously. It should have been impossible.

But his people were already doing it.

In Bay Seven, the Kryllian drive unit maneuvered into position, guided by six suited engineers with magnetic clamps. In Bay Three, technicians swarmed over *Gallipoli*'s starboard weapon arrays, connecting salvaged fire control systems with desperate speed. In Bay Five, the civilian shield generators from *Abundant Hope* hung suspended over *Lord Cardigan*'s hull, ready for installation.

Three ships that weren't ready.

Three ships that had to be.

And ten hours to make it happen.

Marcus pulled up the engineering schematics for all three vessels and started identifying additional shortcuts they could take. Every system that wasn't critical to combat operations could be sacrificed. Every regulation that didn't directly impact crew survival could be ignored.

They were going to war in ships held together by emergency welds and borrowed components.

But they were going to war.

And that was all that mattered.

### Third North Fleet, Deep Space

The carrier *In Amber Clad* cut through the void at maximum warp, her escort fleet arrayed in tight formation around her. Nineteen warships in total—the carrier, four battleships, six cruisers, eight destroyers—all running their drives at 110 percent rated capacity. The engineering sections were pushing tolerances that would have made safety inspectors resign on the spot, but no one was thinking about regulations now.

Admiral Katherine Trager stood on the bridge, studying the tactical plot that showed their position relative to Sol system. Seventeen systems. Seventeen stargates. Thirty-four hours of transit time even at this punishing pace.

And they needed to be there in twenty-six.

> "Navigation, confirm our ETA to Sol," she said, though she already knew the answer. She'd been asking every hour, hoping somehow the math would change.

Lieutenant Commander David Park looked up from his console, his expression apologetic.

> "Ma'am, at current speed we'll hit the Xenari jump bridge in thirty-four hours, sixteen minutes. That's assuming we don't have to slow for stargate transit protocols, which technically we should—"

> "We're not slowing," Trager interrupted. "Emergency transit codes. We blow through every gate at full speed. Xenari traffic control can file complaints after Earth is still standing."

> "Aye, ma'am. Even so, thirty-four hours is optimistic. We're redlining the drives on half our destroyers. If we lose one to a burnout—"

> "Then that ship drops out and catches up later. The rest of the fleet doesn't slow down. Not for anything."

Park nodded and returned to his calculations. Trager watched the plot, her jaw tight. Third North Fleet had been conducting disaster recovery operations with Kryllian partners in the Outer Reaches—humanitarian work, helping evacuate populations from a failed colony world. Good work. Important work.

But not as important as defending Earth.

The Kryllians had released them from the joint operation without hesitation. Whatever else you could say about them, they understood priorities. Within thirty minutes of receiving the recall order, Third North Fleet had been warping out at maximum speed.

And it still wasn't fast enough.

> "Ma'am," her communications officer called out. "Message from Xenari traffic control at the jump bridge. They're acknowledging our arrival time and confirming the bridge will be held open for us. No other traffic permitted until we transit."

> "How long can they hold it?" Trager asked.

> "They're saying indefinitely, ma'am. The Xenari are diverting all available power to keep that bridge operational. They'll have it ready the moment we arrive."

That was something, at least. The jump bridge from the Xenari network to Sol was the only way to reach Earth in time to make a difference. Standard stargate-to-stargate transit would take weeks. But the bridge could fold space, shortening the journey to minutes—if you could reach it.

Trager moved to the fleet status display. Nineteen ships, all showing amber or red indicators on their drive systems. They were pushing too hard, running too hot. But the alternative was arriving to find Earth already under Ryzak occupation.

> "CAG," she called to her air wing commander. "Status on the strike wings?"

Commander Michael Chen approached, datapad in hand.

> "All squadrons are running combat drills. We've got sixty Talons operational, another twelve in maintenance that we'll have ready before we hit Sol. The pilots know what's coming—they're drilling intercept patterns against carrier-based strike craft."

> "Morale?"

> "High, ma'am. Angry, but high. Nobody in the wing likes the idea of Earth under attack. They're ready to make the Ryzak regret showing up."

Trager nodded. She'd walked through the hangar deck earlier, seen the ground crews working with focused intensity. Ordnance being loaded, systems being checked, pilots reviewing tactical data. The whole fleet felt it—the knowledge that they were racing against time to defend their homeworld.

Her XO, Captain James Morrison, moved to her side.

> "Admiral, engineering reports from the destroyers. *Thermopylae* and *Agincourt* are both showing stress fractures in their warp coils. They can maintain current speed, but there's risk of catastrophic failure."

> "Acceptable risk," Trager said immediately. "We maintain speed."

> "Understood, ma'am." Morrison hesitated. "The crew knows we're going to arrive late. They know Earth will be fighting without us for at least eight hours."

> "Then we make sure those eight hours count when we do arrive," Trager said. "The Ryzak think they're hitting a soft target. They think they'll have space supremacy by the time we show up. We're going to teach them what happens when you corner a wounded animal."

She looked at the tactical plot again. Somewhere ahead, beyond seventeen systems and thirty-four hours of hard burn, Earth was preparing for the fight of its existence. Federation forces. Earth's Talons. The hastily-repaired battleships from Jovian Shipyards. All of them buying time.

Time for Third North Fleet to arrive and turn the tide.

> "All hands," she said into the fleet-wide comm. "This is Admiral Trager. By now you all know where we're heading and why. Earth is facing an invasion force—two Ryzak combat groups with overwhelming numerical superiority. Our forces in-system are outnumbered, outgunned, and fighting on a timetable measured in hours."

Throughout the fleet, personnel stopped what they were doing to listen.

> "We are thirty-four hours from the jump bridge. Earth will be fighting for at least eight hours without us. Maybe longer. But I want every single person in this fleet to understand something—those eight hours matter. Every Ryzak ship we destroy when we arrive is one less ship threatening our homeworld. Every strike we make is payback for every human who stood in harm's way while we were racing to get there."

She paused, letting that sink in.

> "We're going to push these ships harder than they've ever been pushed. We're going to run our drives at maximum until they scream. And when we arrive at Sol, we're going into that system at full combat readiness, ready to engage immediately. The Ryzak wanted to conquer Earth. We're going to show them they picked the wrong planet."

Another pause.

> "Engineering sections—I know what I'm asking of you. Keep these ships moving. Navigation—plot the fastest possible route, even if it bends every regulation in the book. All combat personnel—prepare for immediate engagement upon arrival. We don't get time to rest, we don't get time to refit. We hit them the moment we're in range."

She took a breath.

> "Earth is counting on us. Our families are counting on us. The people who are fighting right now, buying us time with their lives—they're counting on us. We will not let them down. Trager out."

The bridge was silent for a moment, then Lieutenant Commander Park spoke up.

> "Ma'am, I've optimized the route. We can shave forty-three minutes off the transit time if we skip some standard deceleration protocols at the gates. It's risky, but—"

> "Do it," Trager said. "Every minute matters."

She returned to the tactical plot, watching the fleet's position slowly advancing across the star map. Thirty-four hours. It felt like an eternity.

But Third North Fleet would arrive. And when they did, the Ryzak were going to learn what it meant to threaten Earth.

All across the fleet, the preparations continued. In the hangar bays, ordnance was loaded and fighters were prepped. In the gunnery sections, crews drilled their targeting sequences. In engineering, technicians monitored the straining warp drives, coaxing every ounce of speed from systems already pushed beyond their limits.

Nineteen warships racing against time.

Thirty-four hours to salvation.

And a homeworld that needed them eight hours ago.

**ESTIMATED RYZAK ARRIVAL: 25 HOURS, 47 MINUTES**

## Chapter 3: Knock Knock

### Jovian Shipyards

Chief Engineer Marcus Webb stood in the command center, watching the departure sequence for the battleship *Typhoon*. Her engines flared brilliant blue as the docking clamps released, and she began her slow, deliberate pull away from the shipyard, her massive form silhouetted against Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere.

One hour.

That's all the time they had left before the Ryzak fleet arrived at the jump beacon. One hour to get the combat-ready ships into position, and hopefully a few more to get the others finished.

> "*Typhoon* is away," Lieutenant Sarah Chen reported from her station. "Proceeding to defensive position Alpha-Seven, seventy-five kilometers from the beacon."

> "Acknowledged. Status on *Sentinel*?"

> "Final crew boarding now. Engineering reports the Kryllian drive is online and stable. It's ugly, Chief, but it works. They'll be ready to launch in ten minutes."

Marcus pulled up the tactical display. The jump beacon hung in space near Jupiter's orbit, a spindly structure about a hundred and fifty meters long that could fold space itself, creating a bridge across light-years. Normally it was a carefully controlled piece of infrastructure, with scheduled transits and security protocols.

In one hour, it would become a chokepoint.

Every Federation vessel in the system was converging on the beacon. The battleship *Typhoon* with her full weapon loadout and shields. The destroyer *Sentinel* with her jury-rigged drive. Eight Talon squadrons from various Federation bases throughout the system. Three dozen interceptors that had been running patrol routes or maintenance cycles. Three Federation corvettes built for close-support operations.

All of them positioning themselves for the fight of their lives.

> "What's the tactical plan?" Commander Patricia Hayes asked from Bay Three, where *Gallipoli* sat with weapons crews still loading torpedo tubes.

> "Station Command is coordinating with HARBINGER," Marcus said. "Primary targets are the Ryzak battleships. Two carriers means they'll deploy hundreds of strike craft, but the battleships are what can crack our capital ships. If we can take them out early, we limit the fleet's overall damage output."

> "How do we kill two battleships with what we've got?"

> "Focused fire. *Typhoon* and *Sentinel* will concentrate on the first battleship while our Talons and corvettes engage their screen. The plan is to punch through and mission-kill it before they can bring their full force to bear. Then we shift to the second one."

> "That's assuming the Ryzak cooperate with our plan."

> "It's assuming we survive long enough to make them regret showing up," Marcus corrected.

He switched his view to Bay Five, where the battleship *Lord Cardigan* sat in her cradle. The civilian shield generators were installed, their jury-rigged connections glowing faintly with power flow. Technicians were still running final tests, checking the emergency bypass routing that held the whole system together.

> "Bay Five, Webb. What's *Cardigan*'s status?"

> "Chief, this is Lieutenant Tanaka." The young engineer's voice carried exhaustion and pride in equal measure. "Shields are up and holding. We're reading sixty-two percent coverage, which is better than we projected. The connections are stable for now, but if she takes a direct hit to the shield generators, we could lose everything."

> "Understood. Can she fight?"

> "She can absorb damage, sir. That's what she's built for. The guns will be firing manually, but we've got crews drilling on the manual targeting systems. They're not going to win any accuracy awards, but they can throw rounds downrange."

> "That's all we need. How long until she's ready to launch?"

> "Two hours, sir. We're still loading munitions and running the crew through emergency drills. These aren't her regular crew—we're pulling from whoever's available."

Marcus looked at the countdown timer. Two hours would put *Cardigan*'s launch at one hour after the Ryzak arrived. She'd be joining a battle already in progress.

He switched to Bay Three.

> "Hayes, what's *Gallipoli*'s status?"

> "Better than *Cardigan*'s," Hayes replied. "Fire control is online and tested. Both railgun arrays are operational. We're loading the last of the torpedo magazines now—*Cardigan*'s entire stock plus our own. We'll have full broadside capability."

> "Time to launch?"

> "Ninety minutes if we push it. The crew needs time to run integration checks with the salvaged fire control systems, but we can compress that if necessary."

> "Compress it. I want *Gallipoli* in the fight as soon as possible. Even if it's just to add her guns to the mix."

> "Understood, Chief. We'll be ready."

Marcus closed the channel and stared at the tactical display. In Bay One, *Typhoon* was clear and moving to her defensive position. In Bay Seven, *Sentinel* would launch in minutes with her oversized drive and compromised hull. In Bay Three and Bay Five, *Gallipoli* and *Lord Cardigan* were being loaded with ammunition, their crews scrambling to learn systems that had been installed hours ago.

Four battleships to face two Ryzak combat groups.

It should have been suicide.

But Marcus had spent twenty years in the Federation, and he'd learned one critical truth: desperate circumstances made people capable of impossible things.

> "All hands," he said into the facility-wide comm. "*Typhoon* is away. *Sentinel* launches in eight minutes. We're now in the final stretch. To the crews on *Gallipoli* and *Lord Cardigan*—you have ninety minutes to finish what you started. Load every torpedo. Check every system. Train every crew station. When you launch, you're going into active combat, and there won't be time for second chances."

He looked out at the shipyard, at the workers moving with focused intensity across the two remaining battleships.

> "To everyone else—our job isn't done when these ships launch. We'll have damaged vessels coming back. We'll have casualties needing medical attention. We'll have ships needing emergency repairs under fire. So stay sharp, stay ready, and remember what we're fighting for."

He paused.

> "One hour until the Ryzak arrive. Let's make sure we're ready to welcome them."

On the tactical display, *Sentinel* began her launch sequence, her jury-rigged Kryllian drive spooling up with a distinctive power signature that would have failed any inspection. But she moved, pulling away from the shipyard with unexpected grace despite her compromised systems.

> "*Sentinel* is away," Chen reported. "Proceeding to defensive position Beta-Four. Captain Okonkwo reports all systems nominal. Well, as nominal as they can be with that drive configuration."

> "That's what I like to hear," Marcus said.

He pulled up the fleet disposition. Federation forces were spreading across the battle space, taking up positions around the jump beacon. The plan was simple in concept: meet the Ryzak as they emerged, hit them with everything available, and buy time for Earth's forces to reach orbit and for the damaged battleships to join the fight.

Simple in concept.

Desperate in execution.

Marcus looked at the countdown timer one more time.

**59 MINUTES, 12 SECONDS**

In Bay Three, weapons crews rolled torpedo pallets toward *Gallipoli*'s magazine. In Bay Five, *Lord Cardigan*'s new shield generators hummed with barely-contained power. Throughout the shipyard, hundreds of personnel moved with purpose, knowing that every minute mattered.

The Ryzak were coming.

And the Federation was ready to knock back.
