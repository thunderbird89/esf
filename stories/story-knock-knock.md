## Chapter 1: The Theft

### The Watering Hole

The bar occupied the lower level of a docking station on the Xenari frontier world of Thal'karesh, where the air tasted of recycled atmosphere and the faint metallic tang of starship fuel. It was the sort of establishment where officers from a dozen different species mingled after long patrols, where the lighting was kept deliberately dim, and where questions were politely not asked.

The Kryllian bartender—a stocky figure in his breathing apparatus—moved with practiced efficiency behind the counter, dispensing drinks with mechanical precision. The clientele tonight was typical: a pair of Seraphyn in the corner booth engaged in what appeared to be a philosophical debate conducted entirely through subtle gestures and occasional soft vocalizations, a cluster of off-duty cargo haulers comparing routes near the window, and scattered throughout, the tall, angular figures of Xenari officers on leave.

One such officer sat alone at the bar, his bioluminescent markings pulsing a steady cyan-green that suggested contentment and mild inebriation. Commander Vael'thi had reason to celebrate—his patrol rotation was complete, his ship was due for refit, and he had two full cycles of leave ahead of him before his next assignment. The drink in front of him was his third, a sweet fermented beverage from his homeworld that the Kryllian bartender kept specifically for Xenari customers.

He didn't notice the woman who slid onto the stool beside him until she spoke.

> "Commander Vael'thi?"

Her voice was smooth, with an accent he couldn't quite place—somewhere between the precise articulation of core-world Xenari and the broader tones of outer colonies. He turned to look at her.

She was striking. Roughly his height when standing, with the lean build and graceful movements of a Xenari, but her coloring was unusual—skin tone somewhere between pale blue and silver, with bioluminescent markings that pulsed a warm violet-pink that his instincts read as interest and curiosity. Her large eyes caught the dim light, pupils dilated in the low illumination. She wore civilian clothing, well-tailored but not ostentatious, and carried herself with a confidence that suggested military background.

> "I'm sorry," Vael'thi said, his words slightly slurred. "Do I know you?"

> "Not yet," she said, her markings brightening slightly. "But I've heard about you. The successful interdiction of that Ryzak probe ship three cycles ago? That was impressive work."

Vael'thi's own markings brightened to blue-white—pride mixed with pleasure at the recognition. The probe ship incident had indeed been noteworthy, though it hadn't received wide publicity outside military channels.

> "How did you hear about that?"

> "I work logistics coordination at the orbital yards," she said smoothly. "We see all the repair requisitions. The damage patterns on your ship told an interesting story." She gestured to the bartender. "Whatever the Commander is drinking, and one for me."

The Kryllian bartender set down two glasses without comment.

> "I'm Shael'na," she said, lifting her glass. "To successful patrols and well-earned leave."

Vael'thi touched his glass to hers, the gentle clink of crystalline material musical in the ambient noise. The drink was good, the company was pleasant, and his markings continued to pulse contentment.

They talked. She asked intelligent questions about patrol routes, about the challenges of maintaining readiness in frontier sectors, about the differences between commanding a frigate versus larger vessels. He found himself enjoying the conversation, enjoying her attention. Her markings shifted through shades of violet and soft blue, her body language open and engaged. When she laughed at one of his stories, the sound was genuine.

The fourth drink appeared without him ordering it. Then the fifth.

Somewhere around the sixth drink, Vael'thi noticed his coordination was declining. His large eyes had trouble focusing, and his bioluminescent markings were flickering irregularly—a sign of significant intoxication that his training told him should concern him more than it currently did.

> "I think," he said carefully, "I may have had too much."

> "Probably," Shael'na agreed, her own markings still steady and controlled. "But you're on leave. You've earned it."

She shifted closer on her stool, and he caught her scent—something that his hindbrain registered as appealing, though he couldn't identify why. Her hand rested briefly on his arm, and he felt the warmth of her touch through his uniform sleeve.

> "Your comm unit," she said, gesturing to the small device clipped to his belt. "Is that a command-grade model? I've only seen those in technical specifications."

> "Hmm?" Vael'thi looked down, his vision doubling slightly. "Oh. Yes. Fleet coordination. We need the secure channels."

> "Can I see it? I've always wondered how they compare to standard issue."

Without thinking, his fingers fumbled at the clip. The alcohol had dulled his natural caution, the caution that would normally have recognized the breach of protocol, the security risk. His hands weren't responding properly, clumsy and slow.

> "Here, let me," Shael'na said, her fingers deft as they unclipped the device. She turned it over in her hands, examining it with apparent interest. "The encryption module is integrated? That must make it heavier than standard units."

> "Bit heavier," Vael'thi agreed. His words were starting to slur more noticeably. "But worth it for the security."

She held it for perhaps fifteen seconds, her fingers moving over the surface with practiced ease. When she handed it back, he took it without question, his intoxicated brain registering nothing unusual.

> "Fascinating," she said. "Thank you for indulging my curiosity."

She glanced at her wrist, where a small chrono was embedded. Her markings flickered briefly—a pattern he couldn't quite interpret in his current state.

> "I should let you get some rest," she said, standing smoothly. "You look like you could use it. Enjoy your leave, Commander."

> "Wait," Vael'thi said, his hand reaching out clumsily. "Will I see you again?"

Her markings shifted to something that might have been regret, or might have been satisfaction. It was hard to tell.

> "Perhaps," she said. "The galaxy is smaller than we think."

She moved through the crowd with fluid grace, and Vael'thi watched her go, his vision blurring at the edges. He tried to stand, found his legs less cooperative than expected, and settled for ordering one more drink instead.

The Kryllian bartender served it without comment, his breathing apparatus hissing softly.

Three blocks away, in a narrow access corridor between docking bays, the woman who had called herself Shael'na ducked into a maintenance alcove. Her markings—artificial bioluminescence generated by the holographic mask—dimmed to nothing as she reached up and carefully peeled the gossamer-thin material from her features.

Beneath the mask, Operative Kresh'tar's reptilian features were set in grim satisfaction. Her thick scaled hide was a mottled pattern of dark greens and grays, and her secondary eyelids flickered as she adjusted to the change in appearance. The Ryzak intelligence officer flexed her clawed hands, relieved to be free of the uncomfortable disguise.

The holographic technology was sophisticated enough to fool Xenari recognition systems, even to replicate the false warmth of their body temperature. But it couldn't replicate their frailty, their lack of physical strength. Kresh'tar's natural Ryzak physiology—powerful, predatory, built for combat—had required conscious effort to suppress throughout the entire interaction. The mask had done the visual work, but the performance had been all hers.

She pulled a small device from her pocket—an intelligence ministry scanner, compact and purpose-built. When she'd held Vael'thi's comm unit, when she'd examined it with apparent curiosity, the scanner had been pressed against the encryption module, copying its quantum-paired key signatures in a fraction of a second.

The small display confirmed successful acquisition. The encryption keys for Xenari fleet coordination channels, complete with the necessary authentication protocols. Temporary access, perhaps only a few cycles before the theft would be discovered and the keys cycled, but temporary was all they needed.

Kresh'tar allowed herself a moment of satisfaction. The Xenari officer would wake tomorrow with a headache and a vague memory of pleasant conversation. By the time he realized anything was wrong—if he ever did—it would be far too late.

She activated her secure comm, the signal heavily encrypted and routed through three relay points to obscure its origin.

> "Kresh'tar to Operations. Package acquired. Authentication successful. Transmitting now."

The response came immediately, her handler's voice crisp and professional.

> "Confirmed. Return to extraction point. Transport is waiting."

Kresh'tar peeled off the remainder of her disguise—the civilian clothing that concealed her true bulk, the soft shoes that hid her clawed feet—and stowed them in a disposal unit. Beneath, she wore the dark combat suit of Ryzak intelligence, form-fitting and functional.

She moved through the maintenance corridors with the confident stride of a predator, her movements now unrestricted by the need to mimic Xenari grace. The transport would take her back to Ryzak space. Her superiors would decrypt the data. And then, finally, they would have what they needed.

Access to the Xenari cynosural network.

The humans had humiliated them. Again and again, their primitive species had defied Ryzak superiority, had struck back with impossible effectiveness. The *Cormorant* gambit, the ambush that had cost them three frigates and valuable intelligence operatives. The other encounters, each one ending in unexpected resistance and Ryzak losses.

But no longer.

If the humans wanted to hide behind Xenari protection, then the Ryzak would simply remove that protection. A pre-emptive strike, executed before the humans could coordinate with their benefactors, before the Xenari could respond with their superior numbers.

Sol system had no stargate. The only access was through the Xenari cynosural beacon. And with the encryption keys now in Ryzak possession, that beacon could be accessed. A subjugation flotilla could bridge directly into the system, bypass the normal security protocols, and strike before anyone knew they were coming.

Kresh'tar's mandibles clicked in anticipation.

The humans would learn what it meant to face the Ryzak when they weren't hiding behind their mysterious benefactors and their stolen technology.

And Earth would burn.
