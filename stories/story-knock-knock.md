## Chapter 1: The Theft

### The Watering Hole

The bar occupied the lower level of a docking station on the Xenari frontier world of Thal'karesh, where the air tasted of recycled atmosphere and the faint metallic tang of starship fuel. It was the sort of establishment where officers from a dozen different species mingled after long patrols, where the lighting was kept deliberately dim, and where questions were politely not asked.

The Kryllian bartender—a stocky figure in his breathing apparatus—moved with practiced efficiency behind the counter, dispensing drinks with mechanical precision. The clientele tonight was typical: a pair of Seraphyn in the corner booth engaged in what appeared to be a philosophical debate conducted entirely through subtle gestures and occasional soft vocalizations, a cluster of off-duty cargo haulers comparing routes near the window, and scattered throughout, the tall, angular figures of Xenari officers on leave.

One such officer sat alone at the bar, his bioluminescent markings pulsing a steady cyan-green that suggested contentment and mild inebriation. Commander Vael'thi had reason to celebrate—his patrol rotation was complete, his ship was due for refit, and he had two full cycles of leave ahead of him before his next assignment. The drink in front of him was his third, a sweet fermented beverage from his homeworld that the Kryllian bartender kept specifically for Xenari customers.

He didn't notice the woman who slid onto the stool beside him until she spoke.

> "Commander Vael'thi?"

Her voice was smooth, with an accent he couldn't quite place—somewhere between the precise articulation of core-world Xenari and the broader tones of outer colonies. He turned to look at her.

She was striking. Roughly his height when standing, with the lean build and graceful movements of a Xenari, but her coloring was unusual—skin tone somewhere between pale blue and silver, with bioluminescent markings that pulsed a warm violet-pink that his instincts read as interest and curiosity. Her large eyes caught the dim light, pupils dilated in the low illumination. She wore civilian clothing, well-tailored but not ostentatious, and carried herself with a confidence that suggested military background.

> "I'm sorry," Vael'thi said, his words slightly slurred. "Do I know you?"

> "Not yet," she said, her markings brightening slightly. "But I've heard about you. The successful interdiction of that Ryzak probe ship three cycles ago? That was impressive work."

Vael'thi's own markings brightened to blue-white—pride mixed with pleasure at the recognition. The probe ship incident had indeed been noteworthy, though it hadn't received wide publicity outside military channels.

> "How did you hear about that?"

> "I work logistics coordination at the orbital yards," she said smoothly. "We see all the repair requisitions. The damage patterns on your ship told an interesting story." She gestured to the bartender. "Whatever the Commander is drinking, and one for me."

The Kryllian bartender set down two glasses without comment.

> "I'm Shael'na," she said, lifting her glass. "To successful patrols and well-earned leave."

Vael'thi touched his glass to hers, the gentle clink of crystalline material musical in the ambient noise. The drink was good, the company was pleasant, and his markings continued to pulse contentment.

They talked. She asked intelligent questions about patrol routes, about the challenges of maintaining readiness in frontier sectors, about the differences between commanding a frigate versus larger vessels. He found himself enjoying the conversation, enjoying her attention. Her markings shifted through shades of violet and soft blue, her body language open and engaged. When she laughed at one of his stories, the sound was genuine.

The fourth drink appeared without him ordering it. Then the fifth.

Somewhere around the sixth drink, Vael'thi noticed his coordination was declining. His large eyes had trouble focusing, and his bioluminescent markings were flickering irregularly—a sign of significant intoxication that his training told him should concern him more than it currently did.

> "I think," he said carefully, "I may have had too much."

> "Probably," Shael'na agreed, her own markings still steady and controlled. "But you're on leave. You've earned it."

She shifted closer on her stool, and he caught her scent—something that his hindbrain registered as appealing, though he couldn't identify why. Her hand rested briefly on his arm, and he felt the warmth of her touch through his uniform sleeve.

> "Your comm unit," she said, gesturing to the small device clipped to his belt. "Is that a command-grade model? I've only seen those in technical specifications."

> "Hmm?" Vael'thi looked down, his vision doubling slightly. "Oh. Yes. Fleet coordination. We need the secure channels."

> "Can I see it? I've always wondered how they compare to standard issue."

Without thinking, his fingers fumbled at the clip. The alcohol had dulled his natural caution, the caution that would normally have recognized the breach of protocol, the security risk. His hands weren't responding properly, clumsy and slow.

> "Here, let me," Shael'na said, her fingers deft as they unclipped the device. She turned it over in her hands, examining it with apparent interest. "The encryption module is integrated? That must make it heavier than standard units."

> "Bit heavier," Vael'thi agreed. His words were starting to slur more noticeably. "But worth it for the security."

She held it for perhaps fifteen seconds, her fingers moving over the surface with practiced ease. When she handed it back, he took it without question, his intoxicated brain registering nothing unusual.

> "Fascinating," she said. "Thank you for indulging my curiosity."

She glanced at her wrist, where a small chrono was embedded. Her markings flickered briefly—a pattern he couldn't quite interpret in his current state.

> "I should let you get some rest," she said, standing smoothly. "You look like you could use it. Enjoy your leave, Commander."

> "Wait," Vael'thi said, his hand reaching out clumsily. "Will I see you again?"

Her markings shifted to something that might have been regret, or might have been satisfaction. It was hard to tell.

> "Perhaps," she said. "The galaxy is smaller than we think."

She moved through the crowd with fluid grace, and Vael'thi watched her go, his vision blurring at the edges. He tried to stand, found his legs less cooperative than expected, and settled for ordering one more drink instead.

The Kryllian bartender served it without comment, his breathing apparatus hissing softly.

---

Three blocks away, in a narrow access corridor between docking bays, the woman who had called herself Shael'na ducked into a maintenance alcove. Her markings—artificial bioluminescence generated by the holographic mask—dimmed to nothing as she reached up and carefully peeled the gossamer-thin material from her features.

Beneath the mask, Operative Kresh'tar's reptilian features were set in grim satisfaction. Her thick scaled hide was a mottled pattern of dark greens and grays, and her secondary eyelids flickered as she adjusted to the change in appearance. The Ryzak intelligence officer flexed her clawed hands, relieved to be free of the uncomfortable disguise.

The holographic technology was sophisticated enough to fool Xenari recognition systems, even to replicate the false warmth of their body temperature. But it couldn't replicate their frailty, their lack of physical strength. Kresh'tar's natural Ryzak physiology—powerful, predatory, built for combat—had required conscious effort to suppress throughout the entire interaction. The mask had done the visual work, but the performance had been all hers.

She pulled a small device from her pocket—an intelligence ministry scanner, compact and purpose-built. When she'd held Vael'thi's comm unit, when she'd examined it with apparent curiosity, the scanner had been pressed against the encryption module, copying its quantum-paired key signatures in a fraction of a second.

The small display confirmed successful acquisition. The encryption keys for Xenari fleet coordination channels, complete with the necessary authentication protocols. Temporary access, perhaps only a few cycles before the theft would be discovered and the keys cycled, but temporary was all they needed.

Kresh'tar allowed herself a moment of satisfaction. The Xenari officer would wake tomorrow with a headache and a vague memory of pleasant conversation. By the time he realized anything was wrong—if he ever did—it would be far too late.

She activated her secure comm, the signal heavily encrypted and routed through three relay points to obscure its origin.

> "Kresh'tar to Operations. Package acquired. Authentication successful. Transmitting now."

The response came immediately, her handler's voice crisp and professional.

> "Confirmed. Return to extraction point. Transport is waiting."

Kresh'tar peeled off the remainder of her disguise—the civilian clothing that concealed her true bulk, the soft shoes that hid her clawed feet—and stowed them in a disposal unit. Beneath, she wore the dark combat suit of Ryzak intelligence, form-fitting and functional.

She moved through the maintenance corridors with the confident stride of a predator, her movements now unrestricted by the need to mimic Xenari grace. The transport would take her back to Ryzak space. Her superiors would decrypt the data. And then, finally, they would have what they needed.

Access to the Xenari jump network.

The Federation had humiliated them. Those mysterious human representatives, operating with Xenari backing, had defied Ryzak superiority again and again. The *Cormorant* gambit, the ambush that had cost them three frigates and valuable intelligence operatives. The other encounters, each one ending in unexpected resistance and Ryzak losses.

But the Federation was small, secretive, operating in the shadows. The humans themselves—billions of them on their homeworld—had never faced the Ryzak. Had never even met an alien species. They were defenseless, unaware, completely unprepared for what was coming.

But no longer.

If the humans wanted to hide behind Xenari protection, then the Ryzak would simply remove that protection. A pre-emptive strike, executed before the humans could coordinate with their benefactors, before the Xenari could respond with their superior numbers.

Sol system had no stargate. Without a jump beacon, interstellar travel to the system was impossible—the only way in or out was through the Xenari jump beacon near Jupiter. And with the encryption keys now in Ryzak possession, that beacon could be accessed. A subjugation flotilla could bridge directly into the system, bypass the normal security protocols, and strike before anyone knew they were coming.

Kresh'tar's mandibles clicked in anticipation.

The humans would learn what it meant to face the Ryzak when they weren't hiding behind their mysterious benefactors and their stolen technology.

And Earth would burn.

### The Morning After

Vael'thi woke to sunlight streaming through the viewport of his quarters, the warm glow of the system's star cutting through the thin curtains. His head throbbed with the steady rhythm of a fusion reactor running just slightly out of phase. His bioluminescent markings pulsed a sickly grayish-blue—the biological equivalent of a hangover warning light.

He groaned, his long limbs tangled in the bedding, and tried to piece together the previous evening. The bar. Celebrating the end of patrol rotation. Drinks. Too many drinks. And—

A woman. Shael'na. Silver-blue skin, violet markings, intelligent questions about ship operations. They'd talked for hours. Or had it been hours? The timeline was hazy, edges blurred by alcohol and poor judgment.

Vael'thi dragged himself upright, his coordination still slightly off. He needed water, analgesics, and approximately six more hours of sleep. In that order.

He stumbled to the small kitchenette, filled a container with water from the dispenser, and drank it in long gulps. His body's biofilm layer felt dehydrated, his skin texture rough. The water helped, marginally.

As cognitive function gradually returned, fragments of conversation surfaced from the alcoholic fog. Patrol routes. Frigate operations. The probe ship interdiction. And—

His comm unit.

The thought arrived with sudden, cold clarity that cut through the hangover like a blade.

She'd asked to see his comm unit. He'd given it to her. No—she'd unclipped it for him because his hands weren't working properly. She'd held it, examined it, asked about the encryption module.

Vael'thi's markings flickered from grayish-blue to dim, uncertain violet. That was protocol violation. Command-grade communications equipment was never to be handled by unauthorized personnel. Never. It was drilled into every officer from their first day of training.

He found the device still clipped to his uniform belt, discarded on the floor where he'd dropped it. The unit looked normal, unmarked, undamaged. He activated it, watching the display come to life with standard startup sequences. Everything appeared functional.

But appearance wasn't the same as security.

Vael'thi stood there for a long moment, water container still in hand, his analytical mind now fully engaged despite the headache. He tried to recall details. Her face—attractive, memorable, but had he seen her before last night? Her accent—she'd said she worked logistics coordination at the orbital yards. That was verifiable. The conversation topics—all professional, all appropriate, nothing that screamed intelligence operative.

Except she'd gotten him drunk, gotten him to hand over secure equipment, and then disappeared.

His markings shifted to rapid flickering violet-pink—intense focus mixed with growing alarm.

He needed to report this. Immediately.

Vael'thi dressed quickly, his movements now sharp and deliberate despite the lingering effects of intoxication. He grabbed a standard-issue comm unit from his desk—not the command-grade one, which was now potentially compromised—and activated the secure channel to station security.

The response came within seconds, a crisp male voice.

> "Security. Go ahead."

> "This is Commander Vael'thi, CNS *Vigilant*. I need to report a potential security breach. Command-grade communications equipment may have been compromised."

There was a pause, brief but significant.

> "Stand by, Commander. Patching you to Intelligence."

The hold lasted perhaps ten seconds before a new voice came on the line, female, with the clipped precision of someone who dealt with worst-case scenarios professionally.

> "Commander Vael'thi, this is Lieutenant Shal'mir, Station Intelligence. Describe the incident."

Vael'thi did, his words precise despite the embarrassment burning through his system. The bar, the drinks, the woman calling herself Shael'na, the examination of his comm unit. He left nothing out, including the excessive alcohol consumption and his impaired judgment.

> "How long did she have physical access to the device?"

> "Fifteen seconds. Perhaps twenty."

> "Did you observe her manipulating the interface?"

> "No. She examined it visually, appeared to be checking the weight and form factor."

Another pause, longer this time.

> "Commander, I need you to bring that comm unit to Intelligence immediately. Do not use it for any communications. Do not connect it to any networks. Physical courier only. Understood?"

> "Understood."

> "And Commander? You mentioned she claimed to work logistics coordination. Did she provide a department or supervisor name?"

Vael'thi's markings dimmed. He hadn't asked. He'd been too drunk, too flattered by the attention, too caught up in the conversation to verify basic information.

> "No. She didn't volunteer it, and I didn't ask."

> "We'll pull security footage from the bar. Description?"

Vael'thi provided it—height, build, coloring, the distinctive silver-blue skin tone and violet markings. As he spoke, a cold certainty settled in his chest. The coloring was unusual. He'd remarked on it mentally at the time, but hadn't questioned it.

Because she was attractive, and he was drunk, and his judgment had been catastrophically compromised.

> "Intelligence will meet you at the security checkpoint in ten minutes. Move now, Commander."

The connection terminated.

Vael'thi looked at the command-grade comm unit in his hand, the device that represented his authority, his access, his responsibility. Fifteen seconds had been more than enough time to copy data, to clone authentication protocols, to compromise everything it represented.

He moved toward the door, his headache forgotten, replaced by a much worse pain—the knowledge that his mistake might have consequences far beyond personal embarrassment.

### Fleet Command

Admiral Thresh'nal's bioluminescent markings pulsed a steady, controlled blue as he reviewed the preliminary intelligence report. His office aboard the orbital station was austere by Xenari standards—minimal decoration, maximum functionality, with viewports showing the curved horizon of Thal'karesh below and the scattered lights of the docked fleet visible against the black.

Lieutenant Shal'mir stood before his desk, her posture formal, her own markings showing the rapid violet flicker of someone delivering very bad news to a superior officer.

> "Security footage confirms an individual matching Commander Vael'thi's description entered and exited the establishment at the times he specified," she said. "However, we cannot find any record of this individual in station personnel databases. No Shael'na working logistics coordination. No one matching that description with current authorization codes."

Thresh'nal's markings dimmed slightly—controlled concern.

> "Biometric scan of the footage?"

> "Inconclusive. The individual's biosignature reads as Xenari, but the coloring doesn't match any known regional variations in our database. The bioluminescent patterns appear natural, but they're... unusual. Our analysts flag a probability of sixty-three percent that the appearance was artificially generated."

> "Disguise technology."

> "Yes, sir. We're cross-referencing with known intelligence capabilities of neighboring powers. The Ryzak have demonstrated advanced infiltration techniques in previous incidents."

Thresh'nal stood, his tall frame unfolding from the chair with characteristic Xenari grace. He moved to the viewport, his reflection ghostly in the transparent material.

> "Commander Vael'thi's comm unit?"

> "Our technical team is analyzing it now. Preliminary scans show no obvious tampering, no inserted hardware, no modifications to the encryption module. However—"

> "However?"

> "The quantum signature logs show a brief external connection approximately matching the timeframe when the device was in the stranger's possession. Fourteen point three seconds of active scanning. The connection was sophisticated enough to avoid triggering the unit's intrusion detection, but it left traces in the deeper system logs."

Thresh'nal's markings shifted through several colors in rapid succession—blue-white alarm, violet focus, then settling into a dim, controlled cyan that indicated strategic thinking.

> "They copied the encryption keys."

> "That's our assessment, sir. Fleet coordination keys, authentication protocols, possibly jump beacon access codes."

> "Which beacons?"

> "Commander Vael'thi's security clearance provides access to seventeen frontier beacons, including—" Shal'mir consulted her datapad, "—the Sol system beacon."

The silence that followed was profound.

Sol system. The protected zone. The human homeworld, where the Federation operated as humanity's secret representatives in galactic affairs. The system had no stargate, and without a jump beacon, interstellar travel was impossible—the single Xenari jump beacon maintained near Jupiter was the only way in or out, used exclusively for covert Federation transport.

A beacon that could now be accessed by anyone with the stolen encryption keys.

> "Time to compromise," Thresh'nal said, his voice steady despite the implications.

> "Unknown, sir. If they copied the keys in that fourteen-second window, they could have transmitted them immediately. Best case, we're looking at several hours since initial compromise. Worst case—"

> "Worst case, they already have ships en route."

> "Yes, sir."

Thresh'nal turned from the viewport, his markings now pulsing the rapid blue-white that indicated decisive action.

> "Alert the Great Circle. Full security protocol. I want fleet-wide encryption key rotation initiated immediately. All beacons, all channels, all authentication codes. How long for the rotation to propagate?"

Shal'mir's markings flickered—calculation mixed with concern.

> "Full fleet rotation will take eighteen hours minimum, sir. Priority channels can be rotated in six hours, but the remote beacons—especially those in protected zones like Sol—operate on longer refresh cycles. We're looking at twenty-four to thirty-six hours for complete network security restoration."

> "Make it happen. Priority authorization from my office. And Lieutenant?"

> "Sir?"

> "Send encrypted warning to the Sol beacon. Inform our contacts in the Federation that their security may be compromised. They need to prepare for possible Ryzak incursion."

Shal'mir's markings pulsed acknowledgment. She turned to leave, then hesitated.

> "Sir, if the Ryzak are planning a strike on Sol, why steal encryption keys instead of simply assembling a force at the border?"

Thresh'nal's markings dimmed to somber violet.

> "Because CONCORD would detect the fleet assembly and issue sanctions before they could reach the system. But a smaller force, using our own jump beacon and our own encryption? They could bridge directly into Sol system, bypass all border security, and achieve complete tactical surprise."

> "A pre-emptive strike."

> "Exactly. Disable the humans before they can coordinate with us, before the Federation can respond, before anyone knows the Ryzak have arrived. By the time we detect the incursion, Earth could be burning."

Shal'mir's bioluminescent markings flickered rapid violet-pink—the pattern that indicated a Xenari processing deeply disturbing implications.

> "The Federation has proven resourceful, sir. They've repelled Ryzak forces before."

> "The Federation," Thresh'nal corrected, his markings pulsing somber violet. "A small, covert organization operating as humanity's representatives. The humans themselves have never encountered alien species. Never faced combat in space. They don't even know the Ryzak exist." He paused. "The Federation might hold against a probe or reconnaissance element. But a dedicated subjugation flotilla, arriving without warning, targeting Earth directly? The humans won't know what hit them."

He moved back to his desk, already pulling up fleet disposition maps and communication protocols.

> "Send the warning. Begin the key rotation. And pray that we're not already too late."

### Ryzak War Council

The command chamber aboard the dreadnought *Bloodfang* was a study in controlled aggression. Dark metal walls bore the scars of countless ritualized duels, and the air carried the scent of heated metal and the musk of Ryzak warriors. High Admiral Kraveth stood before the tactical display, his massive frame silhouetted against the holographic representation of known space. His scales were dark green, almost black, marked with the pale scars of a hundred battles.

Around the chamber, his senior officers waited in disciplined silence. Two carrier captains, four battleship commanders, the cruiser squadron leader, and the destroyer flotilla commander. All bore the clan markings of elite warrior castes, and all had proven themselves in combat trials.

Kraveth's clawed hand gestured at the display, and a section expanded—the Sol system, marked in red as a protected zone, with a single Xenari jump beacon icon pulsing near the outer planets.

> "The encryption keys are verified," he said, his voice a low rumble that carried the weight of authority. "Intelligence confirms full access to Xenari jump network protocols. The window of opportunity is measured in cycles, perhaps less. The Xenari will rotate their keys once they discover the theft."

Captain Vorash, commander of the carrier *Stormbreaker*, flexed his claws in anticipation.

> "The Federation operatives have been a persistent irritant. This is our opportunity to eliminate them at their source."

> "Not just eliminate," Kraveth corrected. "Subjugate. The humans are a minor species, barely aware of the galaxy beyond their system. Their Federation is small—perhaps a few thousand operatives at most, scattered across various operations. The billions on their homeworld are defenseless."

Commander Threx of the battleship *Warbringer* leaned forward, his secondary eyelids flickering.

> "The Federation has demonstrated unusual combat effectiveness despite their limited numbers. The *Cormorant* incident—"

> "Was an ambush," Kraveth interrupted, his mandibles clicking dismissively. "A clever trap, yes. But it required preparation, positioning, and the element of surprise. We will not grant them that luxury this time."

He manipulated the display, bringing up fleet disposition data.

> "The Federation's successes stem from operating in the shadows, from choosing when and where to engage. They strike probe ships, reconnaissance elements, isolated patrols. They have never faced a dedicated battle fleet."

> "Intelligence estimates their total combat strength?" asked Captain Hresh of the carrier *Doombringer*.

> "Unknown with certainty," Kraveth admitted. "But based on observed engagements, we estimate no more than thirty to fifty combat vessels, mostly small craft. Fighters, interceptors, perhaps a handful of corvettes or light frigates. They lack the industrial base for larger capital ships."

The officers exchanged glances. By Ryzak standards, that was barely a screening force.

> "The humans themselves have no space combat capability," Kraveth continued. "Their most advanced vessels are primitive chemical rockets capable of reaching their moon. They have satellites, space stations, but nothing that qualifies as military hardware by galactic standards."

Captain Vorash's claws drummed against the tactical display's edge.

> "Then why the protected zone designation? Why does CONCORD shield them?"

> "Politics," Kraveth said, the word carrying contempt. "The Xenari sponsor them. The Seraphyn find them interesting. CONCORD maintains the fiction of protection to preserve diplomatic balance." His scales rippled with satisfaction. "But if we strike quickly, decisively, before anyone can respond? By the time CONCORD convenes to discuss sanctions, the humans will be under our control."

Commander Gresh of the cruiser squadron spoke, his voice measured.

> "The Xenari will not simply accept this. They will respond."

> "Eventually," Kraveth agreed. "But their nearest battle fleets are positioned at frontier stations, monitoring other border regions. By the time they mobilize and transit to Sol, we will have established orbital supremacy and begun ground operations. CONCORD will negotiate a settlement rather than risk open warfare between great powers."

He expanded the tactical display to show the proposed fleet composition.

> "Two combat groups. Two carriers, four battleships, four cruisers, eight destroyers, sixteen frigates. Sufficient force to overwhelm any Federation presence, establish orbital control, and begin systematic pacification of the human homeworld."

The numbers were substantial—enough firepower to reduce a planetary surface to molten slag if necessary, though subjugation was more profitable than destruction.

Captain Hresh examined the display.

> "Jump beacon protocol? The Xenari beacon will detect our approach signature."

> "The stolen keys include authentication protocols," Kraveth said. "We will transmit as Xenari vessels conducting authorized transit. By the time they realize the deception, we will already be in-system."

> "The carriers will deploy strike craft immediately upon emergence," Vorash added. "Establish combat air patrol, suppress any Federation response."

> "Battleships form the main battle line," Kraveth continued, gesturing at the display. "Cruisers provide fire support and screening. Destroyers handle escort duties and point defense. Frigates conduct reconnaissance and pursuit operations."

Commander Threx nodded slowly.

> "When do we deploy?"

> "Immediately." Kraveth's mandibles clicked with finality. "The encryption keys have a limited operational window. Intelligence estimates twenty to thirty cycles before the Xenari complete their key rotation. We must bridge into Sol system within the next twelve cycles to ensure access."

He straightened to his full height, scales reflecting the red glow of the tactical display.

> "The humans have embarrassed us through their Federation puppets for the last time. We will demonstrate what happens when a minor species dares to resist the Ryzak Empire. Earth will burn, or it will kneel. Either outcome is acceptable."

The assembled officers struck their chests in unison, the sound like thunder in the confined space.

> "For the Empire!"

> "For the Empire," Kraveth echoed. "Fleet commanders, return to your vessels. Begin jump calculations for Sol system. Target coordinates will be transmitted using the stolen authentication protocols. We deploy in six cycles."

As the officers filed out, Captain Vorash lingered.

> "Admiral, if I may—the Federation operatives have demonstrated tactical creativity that exceeds what we typically see from minor species. The *Cormorant* gambit showed sophisticated understanding of our doctrine."

Kraveth's secondary eyelids flickered—acknowledgment without agreement.

> "They are clever, yes. Resourceful. But cleverness has limits when facing overwhelming force. Two combat groups represent more firepower than they have encountered in all their previous engagements combined." He turned to face Vorash fully. "You have concerns?"

> "Caution, Admiral. Not concerns. The humans are unpredictable."

> "All prey is unpredictable when cornered," Kraveth said. "It changes nothing. We have superior numbers, superior firepower, and complete tactical surprise. The Federation cannot possibly muster a defense against this level of force, and the humans themselves are defenseless."

He gestured dismissively.

> "Return to your carrier, Captain. Prepare your strike wings. In twelve cycles, we will show the galaxy what happens to those who defy the Ryzak Empire."

Vorash saluted and departed.

Alone in the command chamber, Kraveth studied the tactical display. The Sol system hung there, small and insignificant, a single star among billions. The humans had no idea what was coming. Their Federation operatives might have won a few skirmishes, but they had never faced the full might of a Ryzak subjugation fleet.

His claws traced the orbital paths of Earth's moon, the inner planets, the gas giants beyond.

Six cycles to assembly.

Twelve cycles to deployment.

And then the humans would learn the price of resistance.

He activated his comm unit.

> "Fleet Operations, this is High Admiral Kraveth. Authorize combat group deployment. Authorization code: Warlord-Seven-Omega. Target designation: Sol system. Transit window: twelve cycles from my mark. Mark."

The response came immediately.

> "Acknowledged, Admiral. Fleet deployment authorized. All vessels moving to assembly point."

Kraveth watched the tactical display as icons began to shift, representing the massive warships beginning their coordination for jump operations. Two carriers, each capable of deploying hundreds of strike craft. Four battleships, mobile fortresses with enough firepower to crack planetary shields. The supporting vessels, each deadly in their own right.

The Federation had won battles.

The Ryzak Empire would win the war.

Earth's fate was already sealed.

### Galileo Station

The Federation station orbited Jupiter at a precisely calculated distance, hidden among the electromagnetic chaos of the gas giant's radiation belts. From the outside, Galileo Station appeared as little more than an irregularly shaped asteroid, its surface pitted and scarred, tumbling slowly in its orbit. The disguise was deliberate and effective. Earth's astronomers had catalogued it decades ago as minor body J2007-447, unremarkable and uninteresting.

Inside, the station housed the Federation's primary command center for Sol system operations. Three hundred personnel, mostly human with a handful of Xenari advisors, maintained constant watch over Earth's orbital space, coordinated covert operations planetside, and served as the communication relay to the wider galaxy.

Commander Sarah Chen stood in the operations center, her eyes fixed on the priority message that had just come through on the Xenari secure channel. The text was clinical, precise, and terrifying.

**PRIORITY ALPHA / XENARI FLEET COMMAND**
**TO: FEDERATION SOL STATION**
**CLASSIFICATION: CRITICAL THREAT**

**ENCRYPTION KEYS COMPROMISED. RYZAK INTELLIGENCE OPERATION CONFIRMED. EXPECT HOSTILE INCURSION SOL SYSTEM VIA JUMP BEACON. ESTIMATED FORCE: TWO COMBAT GROUPS, THIRTY-FOUR VESSELS. ESTIMATED TIME TO ARRIVAL: 8-14 CYCLES (18-32 HOURS EARTH STANDARD).**

**XENARI RESPONSE FLEETS MOBILIZING BUT CANNOT ARRIVE IN TIME TO ESTABLISH DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. KRYLLIAN PARTNERS HAVE RELEASED FEDERATION ASSETS FROM JOINT OPERATIONS. TRANSIT TIME TO SOL: MINIMUM 48 HOURS.**

**YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.**

**RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE DEFENSIVE PREPARATIONS. PROTECT HUMAN HOMEWORLD AT ALL COSTS.**

**XENARI FLEET COMMAND SENDS THEIR REGARDS AND THEIR APOLOGIES.**

Chen read it twice, her hands steady despite the ice forming in her gut. Eighteen years in the Federation, from a junior analyst to station commander, and she'd never seen a message quite like this.

> "Commander?"

She turned. Lieutenant Marcus Webb, her operations officer, stood at the tactical display, his face pale.

> "I'm reading the same message," he said quietly. "Ma'am, we have forty-two operational combat vessels in-system. Mostly Talons, a squadron of Wraiths, three corvettes. Against two Ryzak combat groups?"

Chen moved to the tactical display, where the Sol system hung in miniature, each Federation asset marked in blue. The numbers were stark. Forty-two vessels against thirty-four sounded almost even, until you factored in that the Ryzak force included two carriers with hundreds of strike craft, plus battleships that massed more than the entire Federation presence combined.

> "Pull up fleet disposition," she said. "Everything we have, operational or not."

Webb's fingers moved across the interface. Icons appeared throughout the inner system.

> "Talons: thirty-one operational, four in maintenance at Lunar Base. Wraiths: eight operational, two undergoing refit. Corvettes: three. The destroyer *Sentinel* is in dock at Station One for engine replacement. The frigate *Resolute* is on patrol in the asteroid belt but her shields are running at sixty percent. And we have the station's defensive platforms."

He paused, expanding the view to show Jupiter orbit.

> "Jovian Shipyards has three battleships. The *Typhoon* is fully operational. The *Lord Cardigan* and *Gallipoli* are both in mid-refit—weapons systems offline, shield generators being replaced, crew at half-strength."

> "Defensive platforms won't matter," Chen said flatly. "Ryzak battleships will crack them in the opening salvo. *Sentinel* can't maneuver without engines. And two battleships in refit aren't much better than scrap metal."

She studied the display, her mind racing through scenarios. Every simulation, every tactical briefing, every war game she'd participated in over the years. None of them had modeled this scenario. The Federation had always assumed the Xenari would maintain control of the jump beacon, that any Ryzak incursion would be detected and intercepted before reaching Sol.

> "What about the assets the Xenari mentioned?" Webb asked. "Our fleets operating with the Kryllians?"

> "Too far out," Chen said. "Even with immediate jump clearance, they're looking at forty-eight hours minimum transit time. The Ryzak will be here in eighteen to thirty-two hours."

> "So we fight."

> "We fight," Chen agreed. "But not alone."

Webb's eyes widened slightly.

> "You're talking about Earth."

> "I'm talking about Earth," Chen confirmed. She activated the station-wide comm. "All senior staff to Operations immediately. This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill."

Within three minutes, the operations center filled with personnel. Her XO, Lieutenant Commander James Rodriguez. Chief Engineer Patricia O'Connor. Intelligence Officer Captain David Sung. Tactical Coordinator Major Elena Petrov. And two others—the station's AI liaisons, Lieutenant Sarah Martinez and Commander Thomas Reeves.

> "Priority message from Xenari Fleet Command," Chen said without preamble. "Ryzak incursion expected within eighteen to thirty-two hours. Two combat groups. Thirty-four vessels including carriers and battleships."

The silence was absolute.

> "Our response assets?" Rodriguez asked, his voice carefully controlled.

> "Insufficient," Chen said. "Even if we pull every operational vessel, every fighter, every platform, we're outgunned by a factor of ten. The Ryzak carriers alone can deploy enough strike craft to overwhelm our point defense."

> "Federation reinforcements?" O'Connor asked.

> "Forty-eight hours minimum. The Ryzak will be here in less than half that time."

Major Petrov leaned forward, her hands flat on the tactical display.

> "Then we need to call in the markers."

Chen nodded slowly. Over the past five years, the Federation had quietly transferred advanced technology to several Earth governments. Portugal's Talons. The Japanese trials. The American integration program. NATO pilot training. It had been done carefully, incrementally, preparing Earth for the day when the truth about the galaxy could no longer be hidden.

That day had arrived ahead of schedule.

> "If we activate Earth's assets," Rodriguez said carefully, "we expose the Federation. We expose everything we've been building. The secrecy, the careful introduction of technology—it all ends."

> "It ends anyway when Ryzak battleships start bombarding population centers," Petrov countered. "We can manage the diplomatic fallout later. Right now, we need every available combat asset."

Captain Sung pulled up intelligence assessments.

> "Portugal has twenty-five Talons operational or near-operational. The Japanese have sixteen. The Americans have eight fully integrated plus another twelve in advanced training. That's sixty-one additional fighters if we can coordinate deployment."

> "And the political implications?" Rodriguez asked. "We're talking about revealing alien contact to the entire planet. Mass panic, government destabilization, religious upheaval—"

> "All of which is preferable to extinction," Chen interrupted. Her voice was quiet but carried absolute certainty. "We can manage panic. We can manage political fallout. We cannot manage a Ryzak occupation."

She straightened, her decision made.

> "Lieutenant Martinez, Commander Reeves. Contact HARBINGER and SUNTZU. I need strategic analysis and coordination protocols. We're going to war, and we're going to need every advantage we can manufacture."

The two AI liaisons moved to their stations. Within seconds, the holographic displays flickered to life with two distinct presences.

HARBINGER materialized first—a shifting geometric pattern that suggested rather than depicted a humanoid form, rendered in cool blues and silvers. The AI's voice was calm, almost soothing, with a faint electronic undertone.

> "Commander Chen. I have reviewed the Xenari warning. Situation assessment: critical. Probability of successful defense without additional assets: twelve percent."

> "We're calling Earth," Chen said. "Full activation of all transferred assets. I need you to coordinate communications with the governments involved. Portugal, Japan, United States. Anyone else who has operational hardware."

> "Acknowledged. Recommendation: immediate notification to all parties. Optimal scenario requires eighteen hours minimum preparation time for coordinated response."

SUNTZU manifested beside HARBINGER, its form more angular, aggressive, rendered in deep reds and golds. Where HARBINGER suggested patience and coordination, SUNTZU embodied decisive action.

> "Fleet disposition analysis complete," SUNTZU said, its voice deeper, more resonant. "Ryzak force composition suggests orbital superiority doctrine followed by ground assault. They will attempt to establish space control before engaging surface targets. This provides tactical opportunity."

> "Explain," Chen said.

> "Ryzak doctrine prioritizes destroying orbital assets before surface bombardment. They will engage Federation vessels first. This provides window for Earth forces to deploy and establish defensive positions. If we coordinate emergence points, we can create multiple engagement zones, prevent Ryzak fleet from concentrating firepower."

HARBINGER's geometric pattern shifted, incorporating SUNTZU's tactical data.

> "Strategic synthesis: Federation forces engage immediately upon Ryzak emergence, draw their attention. Earth forces deploy from planetary surface once Ryzak commit to engagement vectors. Multi-vector attack complicates Ryzak targeting solutions, forces them to divide capital ship fire support."

> "It's still a long shot," Rodriguez said quietly.

> "Twelve percent without Earth assets," HARBINGER confirmed. "Forty-one percent with full Earth deployment and optimal coordination. However, Commander, may I reframe the tactical objective?"

Chen looked at the AI's shifting geometric form.

> "Go ahead."

> "Federation reinforcements arrive in forty-eight hours," HARBINGER said. "The Ryzak arrive in eighteen to thirty-two hours. Our objective is not to defeat two combat groups. Our objective is to stall them for sixteen to eighteen hours. Once Federation battle fleets arrive, the Ryzak force becomes tactically untenable."

SUNTZU's angular form pulsed agreement.

> "Correct tactical assessment. We do not need to win. We need to survive. Ryzak doctrine emphasizes decisive engagement. If we deny them quick victory, force extended combat, reduce their strategic momentum—Federation reinforcements will arrive with overwhelming force."

SUNTZU's form flickered as it processed additional data.

> "Additional strategic asset: Jovian Shipyards. Two battleships currently in refit status. If we prioritize emergency deployment protocols, rush critical systems online, we can deploy *Lord Cardigan* and *Gallipoli* approximately three to four hours after Ryzak emergence. They will not be optimal—reduced crew efficiency, secondary systems incomplete—but operational battleship-grade firepower."

> "And *Typhoon*?" Chen asked.

> "Fully operational. Can take defensive position immediately. Three battleships alter Ryzak tactical calculus significantly. Their carriers will need to dedicate strike craft to capital ship suppression rather than fighter superiority, and their battleships will need to primary ours, leaving them unable to engage the station or smaller vessels."

> "Probability of survival for sixteen hours?" Chen asked.

> "With Earth assets and optimal coordination: seventy-three percent," HARBINGER said. "The timeline favors defense. Every hour we hold reduces Ryzak tactical options and increases probability of reinforcement arrival."

Chen looked at the faces around her. These people had trained for this moment, had dedicated their lives to protecting Earth from threats the planet didn't even know existed. Now the bill had come due.

> "HARBINGER, draft priority communications to all Earth governments with active technology transfers. Authorization code Chen-Alpha-Seven. Tell them the truth. Tell them we're out of time. And tell them we need every pilot, every aircraft, every weapons system they can put in space within eighteen hours."

> "SUNTZU, begin strategic coordination. I want defensive positions, engagement zones, fall-back vectors. We're not trying to destroy them. We're trying to hold them for sixteen hours until our reinforcements arrive. Design the defense accordingly."

Both AIs pulsed acknowledgment.

> "Commander Chen," HARBINGER said, its voice carrying unusual weight, "this action will fundamentally alter Earth's relationship with the galaxy. There is no returning to secrecy once this begins."

> "I know," Chen said quietly. "But better Earth knows the truth and survives than dies in ignorance."

SUNTZU's angular form shifted, a gesture that might have been approval.

> "The enemy has chosen the time and place of this battle. We will choose how it is fought. Beginning strategic coordination now."

Chen turned back to the tactical display, watching as SUNTZU began plotting defensive positions, engagement vectors, fallback lines. Somewhere out there, a Ryzak fleet was preparing to jump. Earth didn't know they were coming. The governments she was about to contact would have less than a day to process the existence of aliens, absorb the reality of an invasion, and deploy their forces.

It should have been impossible.

But they didn't need to win. They just needed to survive long enough for help to arrive.

> "All hands," she said into the station comm, her voice carrying throughout Galileo Station. "Battle stations. This is not a drill. Ryzak incursion expected within thirty-two hours. We are going to defensive posture Alpha. And we are calling Earth."

She closed the comm and looked at her staff.

> "We've spent twenty years preparing Earth for first contact. We just ran out of time for a gentle introduction. HARBINGER, send the messages. SUNTZU, coordinate our response. Everyone else—let's figure out how we're going to hold off two Ryzak combat groups for sixteen hours."

HARBINGER's form pulsed once.

> "Messages transmitting on all secure channels. Priority Alpha authorization. Earth governments will receive notification within the hour."

> "And God help us all," Rodriguez muttered.

Chen didn't respond. She was watching the countdown timer that SUNTZU had placed on the main display.

**ESTIMATED RYZAK ARRIVAL: 27 HOURS, 43 MINUTES**

The clock was running. Out in the galaxy, Federation ships were warping gate-to-gate, rushing to the closest available jump bridge to get them home. Somewhere, a Ryzak supercarrier was already spooling to create a wormhole bridging lightyears to drop their ships into Sol. On Earth, phones would soon start to ring, and high-ranking people would be getting some unexpected visits. The dice were cast and the pieces dropping into place.

Earth's awakening had begun.

## Chapter 2: Wakeup Call

### The White House

President Donald Trump was not in a good mood.

He'd been asleep for maybe three hours when the Secret Service detail burst into the residence, their urgency cutting through the usual protocols. No apologies, no explanations, just firm hands guiding him toward hastily provided clothes and insistent voices repeating that he needed to come with them immediately.

Now, at 3:47 AM, he stalked down the corridor toward the Situation Room, still buttoning his shirt, flanked by agents whose expressions told him this wasn't a drill and wasn't negotiable. Chief of Staff Susie Wiles hurried alongside him, her phone pressed to her ear, her face pale.

> "What is this about?" Trump demanded. "Russia? China? Talk to me, Susie."

> "Sir, I don't—they won't say. The Joint Chiefs are already in the Situation Room. They said you needed to see it yourself."

> "At four in the morning? This better be good."

The door to the Situation Room stood open, light spilling into the hallway. Trump could hear that voice—HARBINGER's distinctive gravelly electronic tone—and his expression shifted. He'd been briefed on the AI before, knew what it represented. If HARBINGER was on every screen at this hour, something had gone very wrong.

He pushed through the door.

The room was packed. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Charles Brown stood at the head of the table, his uniform crisp despite the hour. Around him, the other service chiefs occupied their usual positions—General Randy George from the Army, Admiral Lisa Franchetti from the Navy, General David Allvin from the Air Force, General Eric Smith from the Marines, and General Michael Guetlein from Space Force. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stood near the wall, his expression grim.

Every screen in the room showed HARBINGER's shifting geometric form, rendered in cool blues and silvers. The AI's voice filled the space, mid-sentence when Trump entered.

> "—critical that all available assets reach orbital deployment positions within eighteen hours. Each hour of delay reduces defensive probability by approximately seven percent."

The geometric form pulsed once as Trump entered, acknowledging his presence.

> "Mr. President."

> "HARBINGER." Trump moved to his chair but didn't sit, his hands flat on the table. "I'm guessing this isn't a drill."

> "Correct, Mr. President. Twenty-three hours ago, hostile forces acquired unauthorized access to the jump beacon in this system. We are facing an imminent invasion. Estimated arrival: twenty-six hours."

The main display shifted. The geometric pattern moved to a corner window while the center screen showed a star map. Earth at the center, Jupiter's orbit marked beyond. And near Jupiter, a cluster of red icons multiplying rapidly.

> "Two Ryzak combat groups. Thirty-four capital ships. Two carriers deploying six hundred strike craft, four battleships, supporting vessels. This is a subjugation fleet, Mr. President. They intend to establish orbital control and occupy Earth."

Trump's jaw tightened. He looked at General Brown.

> "Charlie?"

> "Sir, we've reviewed the tactical assessment. It's credible. The threat is real."

> "Okay. Okay." Trump's hands gestured as he processed. "So we've got—what, twenty-six hours before these things show up? And they're coming here? To Earth?"

> "Correct, Mr. President."

> "And what do we have to stop them? Don't sugarcoat it."

HARBINGER's form pulsed.

> "The Federation has forty-two operational combat vessels in-system. Against this force, survival probability is twelve percent. However, if we deploy all available Earth assets—the Talons we previously provided to the United States, Portugal, Japan, and other nations—survival probability increases to seventy-three percent."

> "Seventy-three. That's better than twelve, I can tell you that." Trump turned to General Allvin. "Dave, the Talons. How many do we have operational?"

> "Sir, eight fully mission-capable at Groom Lake. Twelve more in advanced training status at Edwards, Nellis, and Ellington. If we push it, we can have all twenty ready for deployment."

> "Then we push it." Trump looked back at HARBINGER. "What else?"

> "Portugal has twenty-five Talons operational or near-operational. Japan has sixteen. Combined with Federation assets and optimal coordination, we can field sufficient force to hold the Ryzak for approximately sixteen hours."

> "Hold them? Not beat them?"

> "Federation reinforcements are en route from allied systems, Mr. President. Arrival time: forty-eight hours. Our objective is not to defeat two combat groups. Our objective is to survive long enough for overwhelming reinforcements to arrive. Sixteen hours of sustained defense will force the Ryzak into an untenable position."

General Smith leaned forward.

> "What's to stop them from just bombarding population centers from orbit?"

> "Ryzak doctrine prioritizes subjugation over destruction," HARBINGER replied. "Dead worlds have no economic value. They will attempt to establish space control first, neutralize defensive assets, then begin ground operations. However, if resistance proves too costly, they are capable of bombardment."

Admiral Franchetti's hands were flat on the table.

> "Sir, our Navy assets can't reach orbital altitude. This fight happens in space. We're dependent on the Air Force and Space Force assets."

> "The Talons," Trump said. He turned back to HARBINGER. "You're telling me we need every single one of those aircraft in the fight. All twenty of ours, all twenty-five from Portugal, all sixteen from Japan. Everything."

> "Correct, Mr. President. Your pilots will operate under strategic and tactical guidance from Federation command structure, but deployment authority remains with national militaries. This is an Earth defense operation."

> "Good. That's good." Trump's hands moved as he spoke. "We're not handing over command to some—no offense—to some computer. Our pilots, our aircraft, we're coordinating but we're flying them."

> "Understood, Mr. President. I will provide targeting data, threat assessment, and tactical recommendations. Your pilots execute."

General Guetlein spoke up.

> "Sir, the training squadrons—those pilots aren't fully certified yet. We'd be pushing them into combat ahead of schedule."

> "Then we push them." Trump's tone left no room for argument. "Dave, can they fly the aircraft?"

General Allvin nodded.

> "Yes, sir. They're qualified on the systems. They're just not fully mission-ready by peacetime standards."

> "Well, this isn't peacetime, is it? Get them ready." Trump looked around the table. "What else do we need? What am I missing here?"

Trump moved to the display, studying the red icons clustered near Jupiter.

> "So let me get this straight. We've got twenty-six hours. These Ryzak—bad guys, very bad guys—they're coming to take over Earth. We've got seventy-three percent odds if we use everything we have. And if we don't, we're looking at twelve percent."

> "Correct, Mr. President."

> "Twelve percent." Trump shook his head. "That's terrible. That's the worst odds I've ever heard. We're not doing twelve percent."

He turned back to the table.

> "Okay. Here's what we're doing. General Allvin, you get every single Talon pilot we have—I don't care if they're at Groom Lake, Edwards, Nellis, wherever—you get them ready to fly. All twenty aircraft, all twenty pilots. They're going into space, they're going to fight, and they're going to win."

> "Yes, sir."

> "General Brown, I want you coordinating with HARBINGER here on overall strategy. But our people fly our aircraft, understood? We're not giving up command."

> "Understood, sir."

> "Admiral, I know the Navy can't fight in space, but you've got logistics, you've got support capability. Whatever the Air Force and Space Force need, you make sure they get it."

> "Yes, Mr. President."

Trump's hands moved as he spoke, emphasizing each point.

> "Now, Congress. We need to brief the leadership. Mike Johnson, Chuck Schumer, the intelligence chairs—"

> "Mr. President," HARBINGER interrupted, "I am already initiating contact with all members of Congress, as well as the governments of Portugal, Japan, and other nations fielding Talon assets. Simultaneous briefings are more efficient given the time constraints."

Trump paused, then nodded.

> "Okay. Good. That's good. You do that. But Charlie—" he pointed at General Brown, "—I want our people talking to their people too. Government to government. This isn't just some AI telling everyone what to do. This is the United States coordinating with our allies on a defense operation."

> "Yes, sir. I'll have State Department protocols initiated immediately."

> "Susie," Trump turned to Wiles, "start working on a public statement. We may need to tell people what's happening before this is over. Keep it simple. Keep it calm. We don't want panic, but we're not lying to them either."

Wiles nodded, already making notes.

Trump looked back at HARBINGER's geometric form.

> "One more thing. These odds you're giving me—seventy-three percent. That's if everything goes perfectly, right? If all our allies show up, if all the pilots perform, if nothing goes wrong."

> "Correct, Mr. President. That calculation assumes optimal coordination and performance."

> "Well, nothing ever goes perfectly. You know that, I know that. So what are we really looking at here? Give it to me straight."

The geometric form pulsed, considering.

> "Realistic probability, accounting for friction, communications delays, and combat variables: approximately sixty-one percent survival probability. Still substantially better than twelve percent without Earth assets."

> "Sixty-one. Okay." Trump's jaw set. "I've won with worse odds. We're doing this."

He turned to face his assembled military leadership.

> "Ladies and gentlemen, we've got twenty-six hours to prepare for the biggest fight in human history. These Ryzak think we're primitives, think we're easy targets. They're about to find out they made a big mistake. A huge mistake. We're going to show them what Americans can do. What humanity can do."

He pointed at the display.

> "HARBINGER, you have full authorization to coordinate with our military. Provide them whatever they need—intelligence, targeting data, tactical recommendations. But our people are flying those aircraft, and we're defending our planet. Got it?"

> "Understood, Mr. President. Coordination protocols are already active."

> "Good. Very good." Trump looked around the room one more time. "Get moving, all of you. General Brown, I want updates every hour. Not every two hours, not every three hours—every hour. And somebody get me coffee. It's going to be a long day."

He strode from the Situation Room, Wiles scrambling to keep up. Behind him, the Joint Chiefs were already moving, phones out, orders being issued. On every screen, HARBINGER's geometric form pulsed steady blue-silver, coordinating simultaneous briefings across multiple governments, preparing Earth's defense.

### Monte Real Air Base, Portugal

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas's phone had rung at 8:23 AM local time. The voice on the other end was clipped, urgent, and offered no explanation beyond three words: "Report immediately. Priority Alpha."

Now, at 9:15 AM, he stood in the secure briefing room at Monte Real Air Base alongside nineteen other Talon pilots, all summoned with the same cryptic message. General António Silva, Commander of the Portuguese Air Force, stood at the head of the room with Defense Minister Nuno Melo. Both men looked like they'd been awake for hours.

Every screen in the room displayed the same thing: a shifting geometric pattern in blue and silver that pulsed with an almost organic rhythm.

Miguel had never seen anything like it.

> "Attention," General Silva said, his voice cutting through the low murmur of confused pilots. "What you are about to hear is classified at the highest level. As of this moment, you are all under operational security protocols. No communications outside this room without authorization."

The room fell silent.

> "I am HARBINGER," the voice from the speakers said, deep and electronic with that distinctive gravelly quality. "I am an artificial intelligence deployed by the EarthSpace Federation. For those unfamiliar with the Federation, you have been flying their technology for the past three years. The Talons you operate were provided to Portugal as part of a broader preparation initiative."

Miguel exchanged glances with Captain Teresa Ramos beside him. They'd been told the Talons were experimental aircraft developed through international partnership. Not that they were built with alien technology.

> "Twenty-three hours ago," HARBINGER continued, "hostile extraterrestrial forces acquired unauthorized access to a jump beacon in this solar system. A Ryzak subjugation fleet—thirty-four capital ships including two carriers deploying six hundred strike craft—will arrive in approximately twenty-six hours. Their objective is the occupation of Earth."

The silence in the room became absolute. Miguel felt his heart hammering. This had to be some kind of test. Some elaborate training scenario.

But General Silva's expression said otherwise.

The display shifted, showing a tactical map of the solar system. Red icons clustered near Jupiter, growing in number.

> "The Federation has forty-two operational combat vessels currently in-system. Against the incoming Ryzak force, survival probability is twelve percent. However, Portugal currently has twenty-five Talon interceptors operational or near-operational status. If deployed in coordination with Federation forces and other Earth nations, survival probability increases to seventy-three percent."

> "You're asking us to fight aliens," Captain Ramos said, her voice steady despite the absurdity of the statement. "In space."

> "Correct, Captain Ramos. The Talons you have been training in are hybrid atmospheric-space superiority fighters. You have logged hundreds of hours in high-altitude intercept scenarios, orbital insertion maneuvers, and zero-gravity combat protocols. Your training was designed specifically for this contingency."

Miguel's mind raced through the past three years. The unusual flight profiles. The sealed orders. The simulation scenarios that always seemed just slightly beyond realistic. They'd been preparing for this without knowing it.

> "General Silva," HARBINGER said, "I am making similar requests to the United States, Japan, and other nations currently fielding Talon assets. This is not a Federation operation. This is an Earth defense operation. Your pilots will operate under Portuguese command, with strategic and tactical coordination provided by Federation resources. Deployment authority remains with your government."

General Silva stepped forward, his hands clasped behind his back.

> "Defense Minister Melo and I have been in contact with the Prime Minister. Portugal has a decision to make, and we have very little time to make it." He looked at the assembled pilots. "This is not about NATO. This is not about European defense. This is about the survival of our species."

He turned to face HARBINGER's geometric form.

> "You're asking us to commit our entire operational Talon force. All twenty-five aircraft. Every pilot we have trained. If we do this, Portugal will have no strategic air defense assets remaining."

> "Correct, General. However, if the Ryzak establish orbital control, Portuguese air defense assets become irrelevant. They will bombard from space with impunity. There will be no Air Force to defend because there will be no Portugal to defend."

The bluntness of the statement hit like a physical blow. Miguel saw it register on every face in the room.

> "What are our chances?" Defense Minister Melo asked. "Really."

> "With full deployment of all available Earth assets and optimal coordination: sixty-one percent survival probability accounting for combat variables and friction. Without Earth forces, the Federation fleet will be overwhelmed in approximately four hours of sustained combat. The Ryzak will then proceed with orbital bombardment and ground invasion unopposed."

> "And if we survive the sixteen hours you mentioned?"

> "Federation reinforcements arrive with overwhelming force. The Ryzak fleet will be forced to retreat or face destruction. Earth remains free."

General Silva was quiet for a long moment, studying the tactical display. Then he turned to face his pilots.

> "I need to know, right now, who is willing to fly this mission. This is voluntary. No one will be forced into combat against an alien invasion force. But I need to know who will stand with me."

Miguel didn't hesitate. His hand went up.

Around the room, nineteen other hands followed.

General Silva nodded slowly, something like pride crossing his features.

> "Very well." He turned back to HARBINGER. "Portugal will deploy all twenty-five Talons. But understand this—these are Portuguese pilots flying Portuguese aircraft in defense of Earth. We coordinate with your Federation, but we do not take orders from an AI."

> "Understood, General Silva. I will provide threat assessment, targeting data, and tactical recommendations. Your pilots execute according to Portuguese command authority. Coordination protocols are being established now with all participating nations."

> "When do we deploy?"

> "All Talon forces must reach orbital deployment positions within eighteen hours. I am transmitting assembly coordinates now. Portuguese forces will integrate with Federation defensive formations in Sector Seven, covering European and African orbital approaches."

The tactical display updated, showing orbital paths, defensive positions, and coordination points with other national forces.

> "Eighteen hours," General Silva said. "We need pre-flight checks, weapons loading, pilot briefings, coordination with ground support—"

> "All technical specifications and coordination protocols are being transmitted to your maintenance teams now," HARBINGER said. "Federation logistics personnel are en route to Monte Real to assist with preparation. They will arrive in forty-seven minutes."

Miguel caught Captain Ramos's eye. She looked as stunned as he felt.

> "One more thing," General Silva said. "Our pilots need to know what they're facing. What are these Ryzak? What are their capabilities?"

The display shifted again, showing what could only be described as a nightmare rendered in tactical data. Reptilian forms in heavy armor. Weapons specifications. Ship classifications.

> "The Ryzak are an aggressive militaristic species," HARBINGER said. "They have conquered dozens of civilizations through superior firepower and ruthless tactics. They do not negotiate. They do not retreat unless facing overwhelming force. And they view humanity as primitives requiring subjugation."

> "They're about to learn otherwise," Captain Ramos said quietly.

> "Correct, Captain. That is precisely what they are about to learn."

General Silva turned back to his pilots.

> "You have two hours to contact your families. Tell them you're being deployed. Do not—I repeat, do not—tell them where or why. After that, we begin mission prep. Maintenance teams are being briefed separately. We have eighteen hours to prepare for the most important mission in human history."

He paused, looking at each pilot in turn.

> "Portugal has always stood against tyranny. Today, we stand not just for Portugal, not just for Europe, but for Earth itself. Make your calls. Then let's get to work."

The pilots began filing out, voices rising in urgent conversation. Miguel lingered, staring at the tactical display. Somewhere out there, beyond Jupiter, a hostile fleet was preparing to jump into their system.

He thought of his sister in Lisbon. His parents in Porto. His girlfriend who thought he was just a regular fighter pilot flying regular missions.

In eighteen hours, he'd be flying into space to fight aliens.

The world had just changed, and most people didn't even know it yet.

> "Lieutenant Freitas," HARBINGER's voice came through the speakers, addressing him directly. "Your flight performance records indicate exceptional skill in high-velocity intercept scenarios. I am assigning you as element leader for Strike Package Delta. You will coordinate four Talons in close support of Federation corvette operations."

Miguel straightened, looking at the geometric form on the screen.

> "Understood. I won't let you down."

> "I have analyzed your training records, Lieutenant. I do not believe you will. Coordination briefing begins in ninety minutes. Use your time wisely."

The screen went dark.

Miguel pulled out his phone and stared at it for a long moment before dialing. His sister answered on the third ring, her voice clear and alert.

> "Miguel? What's going on? You never call this early."

> "I know. I'm sorry. I just… I needed to hear your voice. I'm being deployed."

> "Deployed? Where?"

He looked at the now-dark screens, at the empty briefing room, at the future that had just arrived twenty-six hours early.

> "I can't say. Just… tell Mom and Dad I love them. And Maria. Tell her I'll call when I can."

> "Miguel, you're scaring me. What's happening?"

> "I have to go. Just remember—whatever happens, whatever you hear in the next few days—I'm doing my job. We're all doing our jobs. And it matters. It matters more than anything."

He ended the call before she could respond, before he could say something that would violate operational security. Before he could tell her that in twenty-six hours, Earth would be at war.

He had eighteen hours to prepare.

Time to get to work.

### Jovian Shipyards

The shipyards hung in orbit above Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere, a sprawling network of construction frames, docking clamps, and pressurized work modules. Normally, the facility operated on carefully planned schedules, with maintenance crews working standard shifts on vessels that had months to reach operational status.

Now, every light in the facility burned at maximum intensity, and over three hundred personnel swarmed over three Federation battleships like ants on a carcass.

Chief Engineer Marcus Webb stood in the command center overlooking Bay Seven, where the destroyer *Sentinel* sat clamped in her maintenance frame. Through the transparent aluminum viewport, he could see the ship's exposed engine compartment, a gaping wound in her stern where the main drive assembly should have been.

> "Status on the engine swap," he said into his comm.

> "We've got the Kryllian surplus drive unit moving into position now," came the response from Lieutenant Sarah Chen, currently suited up and coordinating the external teams. "It's not pretty, Chief. This thing is forty percent larger than the original spec."

> "Will it fit?"

> "We're making it fit. Cutting away structural members now. We'll reinforce with emergency bracing, but this is going to compromise the hull integrity around the engine mount."

Marcus pulled up the engineering schematics on his display. The Kryllian drive was indeed oversized, designed for a heavy freighter rather than a destroyer. But it would generate thrust, and right now that was all that mattered.

> "How long until it's installed?"

> "Twelve hours if everything goes perfectly. Fourteen realistically."

> "You have ten. Cut every corner that won't kill the crew. We need *Sentinel* mobile."

There was a pause.

> "Understood, Chief. We'll get it done."

Marcus switched channels, looking across the facility to Bay Three, where the battleship *Gallipoli* sat in her refit cradle. Unlike *Sentinel*, her engines were functional. The problem was her weapons.

> "Bay Three, this is Webb. Give me an update on *Gallipoli*'s main batteries."

> "Webb, this is Commander Patricia Hayes." Her voice carried the strain of someone who'd been working for six hours straight. "We've got the port-side railgun array back online. Starboard array is another story—the targeting systems are completely stripped for overhaul. We're pulling components from *Lord Cardigan* to get them operational."

> "What about the missile tubes?"

> "Four forward tubes are loaded and operational. The broadside launchers are empty—we don't have munitions for them. We sent that entire stock back to supply three weeks ago for inspection."

Marcus's jaw tightened. A battleship with half her weapons offline was better than a battleship that couldn't fight at all, but not by much.

> "Can you get the starboard railguns online?"

> "Maybe. We're literally cannibalizing *Lord Cardigan*'s fire control systems. If we prioritize *Gallipoli*, we can probably have both railgun arrays functional in eight hours. But that means *Cardigan* will be firing manually."

> "Do it. *Gallipoli* needs to be our primary gunship. And Hayes—transfer *Cardigan*'s torpedo stock to *Gallipoli* while you're at it. If *Gallipoli* has working fire control, she needs the munitions to use it."

> "Understood. That'll give us full broadside capability once the transfer is complete."

He switched channels again, this time to Bay Five where the battleship *Lord Cardigan* sat silent and dark, her shields completely offline.

> "Bay Five, Webb. Where are we on the shield generators?"

> "Chief, this is Lieutenant Yuki Tanaka." The young engineer's voice was tight with stress. "We've got a problem. The primary generator array is completely disassembled. We're talking about three weeks of work minimum to get it back online properly."

> "We don't have three weeks. We have hours."

> "I know, sir. So here's what we're doing—we're pulling the shield generators from the freighter *Abundant Hope* in Bay Twelve. They're civilian-grade, about sixty percent the output of military spec, but they'll work."

> "How long?"

> "The generators themselves we can install in four hours. But the power conduits are a nightmare. We're having to jury-rig connections because the civilian units don't match our military hardpoints. We're using emergency clamps and bypass routing. It's ugly, sir."

> "Will it hold?"

There was a pause.

> "Honestly? I don't know. The connections aren't rated for combat stress. If *Cardigan* takes a hard hit, we could lose shields entirely. Or the feedback could fry the generators. Or—"

> "Lieutenant." Marcus's voice cut through the spiral. "Will you have shields up in ten hours?"

> "Yes, sir. Some shields. Sixty percent coverage, maybe less. And they might fail if we take concentrated fire."

> "Then that's what we work with. Get it done."

> "Aye, sir. And Chief? The gunners should know—without fire control, they're going to be eyeballing their shots. No targeting solutions, no ballistic computers. Just iron sights and Kentucky windage against moving targets in three-dimensional space."

Marcus closed his eyes briefly. Battleship railguns firing manually against Ryzak warships. It was barely better than throwing rocks.

> "Understood. I'll make sure the gunnery crews know what they're getting into. Webb out."

Marcus closed the channel and stared out at the three battleships. *Typhoon* sat in Bay One, fully operational, her crew already aboard running combat drills. She was ready. But *Sentinel* had no engines, *Gallipoli* had half her weapons offline, and *Lord Cardigan* was being held together with spit, prayer, and jury-rigged civilian shields.

And in less than twenty-six hours, all four vessels would be facing two Ryzak combat groups.

His comm chirped. Commander Sarah Chen from Galileo Station.

> "Chief Webb, this is Station Command. Status update?"

> "Commander, we're working miracles out here, but they're messy miracles. *Sentinel* will be mobile but compromised. *Gallipoli* will have weapons but we had to cannibalize *Cardigan*'s fire control to make it work. *Cardigan* will have shields but they're jury-rigged civilian units, and her gunners will be firing manually—eyeballing shots against moving targets."

> "What's your confidence level?"

Marcus looked at the ships again. At the workers swarming over them, cutting, welding, installing, testing. At the sparks of cutting torches and the glow of welding arcs. At three hundred people who hadn't slept and wouldn't sleep until the job was done.

> "Commander, if we were doing this by the book, I'd say zero confidence. We're violating every safety protocol, every engineering standard, every regulation in the manual. Any inspector would shut us down immediately."

> "But?"

> "But my people are the best in the Federation. They're working with fire in their bellies and no margin for error. We'll have three battleships ready for combat. They won't be pretty, and they won't be perfect, but they'll fight."

> "That's all we need, Chief. How can Station support you?"

> "Send us every spare power cell you have. Every weapons component. Every shield emitter. Hell, send us *Cardigan*'s entire torpedo magazine—we're transferring it to *Gallipoli* since she's got the working fire control. And coffee. Lots of coffee."

> "Already on the way. And Chief?"

> "Yes, ma'am?"

> "Thank your people for me. They're buying Earth time to live."

> "I will, ma'am. Webb out."

He opened the facility-wide channel.

> "All hands, this is Chief Webb. I know you're tired. I know you're working beyond anything we've ever asked of you. But I need you to know what's at stake here." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "In less than a day, a hostile fleet will arrive at Jupiter. They're coming to take Earth. To occupy our home. To subjugate our families."

Across the facility, he saw workers pause, looking up at the speakers.

> "The four ships we're working on right now—they're not just metal and circuits. They're the difference between Earth remaining free and Earth falling to an alien empire. Every weld you complete, every system you bring online, every shortcut you make work—you're saving lives. You're protecting families. You're defending everything we've built."

He looked at *Sentinel*'s exposed engines, at *Cardigan*'s weapon arrays, at *Gallipoli*'s emergency shield installation.

> "We have ten hours to finish what we started. Ten hours to give these ships a fighting chance. I know it's not enough time. I know we're asking the impossible. But I also know that every single person in this facility is capable of miracles when they need to be."

He paused.

> "So let's show these Ryzak bastards what human engineering can do when our backs are against the wall. Let's give them four battleships they'll never forget. Now get back to work—we've got a deadline."

The response came not in words but in renewed activity. Cutting torches flared brighter. Welding arcs intensified. Suited figures moved with fresh urgency across the hulls.

Marcus turned back to his displays, pulling up the master timeline. Ten hours to complete three separate emergency refit operations simultaneously. It should have been impossible.

But his people were already doing it.

In Bay Seven, the Kryllian drive unit maneuvered into position, guided by six suited engineers with magnetic clamps. In Bay Three, technicians swarmed over *Gallipoli*'s starboard weapon arrays, connecting salvaged fire control systems with desperate speed. In Bay Five, the civilian shield generators from *Abundant Hope* hung suspended over *Lord Cardigan*'s hull, ready for installation.

Three ships that weren't ready.

Three ships that had to be.

And ten hours to make it happen.

Marcus pulled up the engineering schematics for all three vessels and started identifying additional shortcuts they could take. Every system that wasn't critical to combat operations could be sacrificed. Every regulation that didn't directly impact crew survival could be ignored.

They were going to war in ships held together by emergency welds and borrowed components.

But they were going to war.

And that was all that mattered.

### Third North Fleet, Deep Space

The carrier *In Amber Clad* cut through the void at maximum warp, her escort fleet arrayed in tight formation around her. Nineteen warships in total—the carrier, four battleships, six cruisers, eight destroyers—all running their drives at 110 percent rated capacity. The engineering sections were pushing tolerances that would have made safety inspectors resign on the spot, but no one was thinking about regulations now.

Admiral Katherine Trager stood on the bridge, studying the tactical plot that showed their position relative to Sol system. Seventeen systems. Seventeen stargates. Thirty-four hours of transit time even at this punishing pace.

And they needed to be there in twenty-six.

> "Navigation, confirm our ETA to Sol," she said, though she already knew the answer. She'd been asking every hour, hoping somehow the math would change.

Lieutenant Commander David Park looked up from his console, his expression apologetic.

> "Ma'am, at current speed we'll hit the Xenari jump bridge in thirty-four hours, sixteen minutes. That's assuming we don't have to slow for stargate transit protocols, which technically we should—"

> "We're not slowing," Trager interrupted. "Emergency transit codes. We blow through every gate at full speed. Xenari traffic control can file complaints after Earth is still standing."

> "Aye, ma'am. Even so, thirty-four hours is optimistic. We're redlining the drives on half our destroyers. If we lose one to a burnout—"

> "Then that ship drops out and catches up later. The rest of the fleet doesn't slow down. Not for anything."

Park nodded and returned to his calculations. Trager watched the plot, her jaw tight. Third North Fleet had been conducting disaster recovery operations with Kryllian partners in the Outer Reaches—humanitarian work, helping evacuate populations from a failed colony world. Good work. Important work.

But not as important as defending Earth.

The Kryllians had released them from the joint operation without hesitation. Whatever else you could say about them, they understood priorities. Within thirty minutes of receiving the recall order, Third North Fleet had been warping out at maximum speed.

And it still wasn't fast enough.

> "Ma'am," her communications officer called out. "Message from Xenari traffic control at the jump bridge. They're acknowledging our arrival time and confirming the bridge will be held open for us. No other traffic permitted until we transit."

> "How long can they hold it?" Trager asked.

> "They're saying indefinitely, ma'am. The Xenari are diverting all available power to keep that bridge operational. They'll have it ready the moment we arrive."

That was something, at least. The jump bridge from the Xenari network to Sol was the only way to reach Earth in time to make a difference. Standard stargate-to-stargate transit would take weeks. But the bridge could fold space, shortening the journey to minutes—if you could reach it.

Trager moved to the fleet status display. Nineteen ships, all showing amber or red indicators on their drive systems. They were pushing too hard, running too hot. But the alternative was arriving to find Earth already under Ryzak occupation.

> "CAG," she called to her air wing commander. "Status on the strike wings?"

Commander Michael Chen approached, datapad in hand.

> "All squadrons are running combat drills. We've got sixty Talons operational, another twelve in maintenance that we'll have ready before we hit Sol. The pilots know what's coming—they're drilling intercept patterns against carrier-based strike craft."

> "Morale?"

> "High, ma'am. Angry, but high. Nobody in the wing likes the idea of Earth under attack. They're ready to make the Ryzak regret showing up."

Trager nodded. She'd walked through the hangar deck earlier, seen the ground crews working with focused intensity. Ordnance being loaded, systems being checked, pilots reviewing tactical data. The whole fleet felt it—the knowledge that they were racing against time to defend their homeworld.

Her XO, Captain James Morrison, moved to her side.

> "Admiral, engineering reports from the destroyers. *Thermopylae* and *Agincourt* are both showing stress fractures in their warp coils. They can maintain current speed, but there's risk of catastrophic failure."

> "Acceptable risk," Trager said immediately. "We maintain speed."

> "Understood, ma'am." Morrison hesitated. "The crew knows we're going to arrive late. They know Earth will be fighting without us for at least eight hours."

> "Then we make sure those eight hours count when we do arrive," Trager said. "The Ryzak think they're hitting a soft target. They think they'll have space supremacy by the time we show up. We're going to teach them what happens when you corner a wounded animal."

She looked at the tactical plot again. Somewhere ahead, beyond seventeen systems and thirty-four hours of hard burn, Earth was preparing for the fight of its existence. Federation forces. Earth's Talons. The hastily-repaired battleships from Jovian Shipyards. All of them buying time.

Time for Third North Fleet to arrive and turn the tide.

> "All hands," she said into the fleet-wide comm. "This is Admiral Trager. By now you all know where we're heading and why. Earth is facing an invasion force—two Ryzak combat groups with overwhelming numerical superiority. Our forces in-system are outnumbered, outgunned, and fighting on a timetable measured in hours."

Throughout the fleet, personnel stopped what they were doing to listen.

> "We are thirty-four hours from the jump bridge. Earth will be fighting for at least eight hours without us. Maybe longer. But I want every single person in this fleet to understand something—those eight hours matter. Every Ryzak ship we destroy when we arrive is one less ship threatening our homeworld. Every strike we make is payback for every human who stood in harm's way while we were racing to get there."

She paused, letting that sink in.

> "We're going to push these ships harder than they've ever been pushed. We're going to run our drives at maximum until they scream. And when we arrive at Sol, we're going into that system at full combat readiness, ready to engage immediately. The Ryzak wanted to conquer Earth. We're going to show them they picked the wrong planet."

Another pause.

> "Engineering sections—I know what I'm asking of you. Keep these ships moving. Navigation—plot the fastest possible route, even if it bends every regulation in the book. All combat personnel—prepare for immediate engagement upon arrival. We don't get time to rest, we don't get time to refit. We hit them the moment we're in range."

She took a breath.

> "Earth is counting on us. Our families are counting on us. The people who are fighting right now, buying us time with their lives—they're counting on us. We will not let them down. Trager out."

The bridge was silent for a moment, then Lieutenant Commander Park spoke up.

> "Ma'am, I've optimized the route. We can shave forty-three minutes off the transit time if we skip some standard deceleration protocols at the gates. It's risky, but—"

> "Do it," Trager said. "Every minute matters."

She returned to the tactical plot, watching the fleet's position slowly advancing across the star map. Thirty-four hours. It felt like an eternity.

But Third North Fleet would arrive. And when they did, the Ryzak were going to learn what it meant to threaten Earth.

All across the fleet, the preparations continued. In the hangar bays, ordnance was loaded and fighters were prepped. In the gunnery sections, crews drilled their targeting sequences. In engineering, technicians monitored the straining warp drives, coaxing every ounce of speed from systems already pushed beyond their limits.

Nineteen warships racing against time.

Thirty-four hours to salvation.

And a homeworld that needed them eight hours ago.

**ESTIMATED RYZAK ARRIVAL: 25 HOURS, 47 MINUTES**

## Chapter 3: Knock Knock

### Jovian Shipyards

Chief Engineer Marcus Webb stood in the command center, watching the departure sequence for the battleship *Typhoon*. Her engines flared brilliant blue as the docking clamps released, and she began her slow, deliberate pull away from the shipyard, her massive form silhouetted against Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere.

One hour.

That's all the time they had left before the Ryzak fleet arrived at the jump beacon. One hour to get the combat-ready ships into position, and hopefully a few more to get the others finished.

> "*Typhoon* is away," Lieutenant Sarah Chen reported from her station. "Proceeding to defensive position Alpha-Seven, seventy-five kilometers from the beacon."

> "Acknowledged. Status on *Sentinel*?"

> "Final crew boarding now. Engineering reports the Kryllian drive is online and stable. It's ugly, Chief, but it works. They'll be ready to launch in ten minutes."

Marcus pulled up the tactical display. The jump beacon hung in space near Jupiter's orbit, a spindly structure about a hundred and fifty meters long that could fold space itself, creating a bridge across light-years. Normally it was a carefully controlled piece of infrastructure, with scheduled transits and security protocols.

In one hour, it would become a chokepoint.

Every Federation vessel in the system was converging on the beacon. The battleship *Typhoon* with her full weapon loadout and shields. The destroyer *Sentinel* with her jury-rigged drive. Eight Talon squadrons from various Federation bases throughout the system. Three dozen interceptors that had been running patrol routes or maintenance cycles. Three Federation corvettes built for close-support operations.

All of them positioning themselves for the fight of their lives.

> "What's the tactical plan?" Commander Patricia Hayes asked from Bay Three, where *Gallipoli* sat with weapons crews still loading torpedo tubes.

> "Station Command is coordinating with HARBINGER," Marcus said. "Primary targets are the Ryzak battleships. Two carriers means they'll deploy hundreds of strike craft, but the battleships are what can crack our capital ships. If we can take them out early, we limit the fleet's overall damage output."

> "How do we kill two battleships with what we've got?"

> "Focused fire. *Typhoon* and *Sentinel* will concentrate on the first battleship while our Talons and corvettes engage their screen. The plan is to punch through and mission-kill it before they can bring their full force to bear. Then we shift to the second one."

> "That's assuming the Ryzak cooperate with our plan."

> "It's assuming we survive long enough to make them regret showing up," Marcus corrected.

He switched his view to Bay Five, where the battleship *Lord Cardigan* sat in her cradle. The civilian shield generators were installed, their jury-rigged connections glowing faintly with power flow. Technicians were still running final tests, checking the emergency bypass routing that held the whole system together.

> "Bay Five, Webb. What's *Cardigan*'s status?"

> "Chief, this is Lieutenant Tanaka." The young engineer's voice carried exhaustion and pride in equal measure. "Shields are up and holding. We're reading sixty-two percent coverage, which is better than we projected. The connections are stable for now, but if she takes a direct hit to the shield generators, we could lose everything."

> "Understood. Can she fight?"

> "She can absorb damage, sir. That's what she's built for. The guns will be firing manually, but we've got crews drilling on the manual targeting systems. They're not going to win any accuracy awards, but they can throw rounds downrange."

> "That's all we need. How long until she's ready to launch?"

> "Two hours, sir. We're still loading munitions and running the crew through emergency drills. These aren't her regular crew—we're pulling from whoever's available."

Marcus looked at the countdown timer. Two hours would put *Cardigan*'s launch at one hour after the Ryzak arrived. She'd be joining a battle already in progress.

He switched to Bay Three.

> "Hayes, what's *Gallipoli*'s status?"

> "Better than *Cardigan*'s," Hayes replied. "Fire control is online and tested. Both railgun arrays are operational. We're loading the last of the torpedo magazines now—*Cardigan*'s entire stock plus our own. We'll have full broadside capability."

> "Time to launch?"

> "Ninety minutes if we push it. The crew needs time to run integration checks with the salvaged fire control systems, but we can compress that if necessary."

> "Compress it. I want *Gallipoli* in the fight as soon as possible. Even if it's just to add her guns to the mix."

> "Understood, Chief. We'll be ready."

Marcus closed the channel and stared at the tactical display. In Bay One, *Typhoon* was clear and moving to her defensive position. In Bay Seven, *Sentinel* would launch in minutes with her oversized drive and compromised hull. In Bay Three and Bay Five, *Gallipoli* and *Lord Cardigan* were being loaded with ammunition, their crews scrambling to learn systems that had been installed hours ago.

Four battleships to face two Ryzak combat groups.

It should have been suicide.

But Marcus had spent twenty years in the Federation, and he'd learned one critical truth: desperate circumstances made people capable of impossible things.

> "All hands," he said into the facility-wide comm. "*Typhoon* is away. *Sentinel* launches in eight minutes. We're now in the final stretch. To the crews on *Gallipoli* and *Lord Cardigan*—you have ninety minutes to finish what you started. Load every torpedo. Check every system. Train every crew station. When you launch, you're going into active combat, and there won't be time for second chances."

He looked out at the shipyard, at the workers moving with focused intensity across the two remaining battleships.

> "To everyone else—our job isn't done when these ships launch. We'll have damaged vessels coming back. We'll have casualties needing medical attention. We'll have ships needing emergency repairs under fire. So stay sharp, stay ready, and remember what we're fighting for."

He paused.

> "One hour until the Ryzak arrive. Let's make sure we're ready to welcome them."

On the tactical display, *Sentinel* began her launch sequence, her jury-rigged Kryllian drive spooling up with a distinctive power signature that would have failed any inspection. But she moved, pulling away from the shipyard with unexpected grace despite her compromised systems.

> "*Sentinel* is away," Chen reported. "Proceeding to defensive position Beta-Four. Captain Okonkwo reports all systems nominal. Well, as nominal as they can be with that drive configuration."

> "That's what I like to hear," Marcus said.

He pulled up the fleet disposition. Federation forces were spreading across the battle space, taking up positions around the jump beacon. The plan was simple in concept: meet the Ryzak as they emerged, hit them with everything available, and buy time for Earth's forces to reach orbit and for the damaged battleships to join the fight.

Simple in concept.

Desperate in execution.

Marcus looked at the countdown timer one more time.

**59 MINUTES, 12 SECONDS**

In Bay Three, weapons crews rolled torpedo pallets toward *Gallipoli*'s magazine. In Bay Five, *Lord Cardigan*'s new shield generators hummed with barely-contained power. Throughout the shipyard, hundreds of personnel moved with purpose, knowing that every minute mattered.

The Ryzak were coming.

And the Federation was ready to knock back.

### Galileo Station

Commander Sarah Chen stood in the operations center, watching the deployment status for the last batch of defense platforms. Six automated weapon stations, each one little more than a railgun mount with a power cell and basic targeting computer, were being pushed out of the station's cargo bay by suited engineers.

> "Platform Delta-Six is away," Lieutenant Marcus Webb reported from his console. "Thrusters firing. Moving to position."

> "Acknowledged. How many does that make?"

> "Eighteen total, ma'am. We've got them spread in a loose sphere around the beacon, between fifty and a hundred kilometers out. They're not going to win any battles, but they'll give the Ryzak more targets to track."

Chen nodded, studying the tactical display. Eighteen defense platforms against two Ryzak combat groups was laughable on paper. Each platform had a single railgun, limited ammunition, and shields that would fail after maybe two hits from a Ryzak destroyer. But that wasn't the point.

The point was to make the Ryzak targeting solutions more complicated. Every platform they shot at was attention they weren't directing at Federation ships. Every second they spent acquiring and eliminating automated defenses was time for human pilots to maneuver and strike.

> "What's their ammunition loadout?" Chen asked.

> "Forty rounds per platform. They'll burn through it in about ninety seconds of sustained fire. After that, they're just expensive decoys."

> "Ninety seconds of fire is ninety seconds we don't have to provide," Chen said. "Every bit helps."

Her communications console chimed. Priority channel from deep space.

> "Commander Chen, this is Admiral Trager, Third North Fleet."

Chen activated the channel. The transmission lag was noticeable—Third North Fleet was still seventeen systems away, racing toward the Xenari jump bridge at speeds that were probably cooking their drive systems.

> "Admiral Trager. Good to hear from you. What's your ETA?"

There was a three-second delay before Trager's response came through.

> "Nine hours to the jump bridge, Commander. I know that's not what you want to hear. We're eight hours behind schedule for the fight."

> "Eight hours, eight days—doesn't matter, Admiral. We hold until you arrive or we don't hold at all."

Another delay.

> "We're running our drives at one-fifteen percent. I've got two destroyers with stress fractures in their warp coils, but they're maintaining speed. We'll arrive at full combat readiness and engage immediately."

Chen looked at the countdown timer. Less than an hour until the Ryzak emerged. Eight hours of fighting before Third North Fleet could relieve them. Possibly more if the battle didn't go well.

> "Understood, Admiral. I'm uploading our tactical situation now. You'll see we've got limited capital ship assets—four battleships, one of which won't be operational until an hour after the shooting starts. Two of the others are... compromised. We're relying heavily on fighters and corvettes to engage their screen while our battleships focus on their heavy assets."

She paused, choosing her words carefully.

> "Admiral, if Galileo Station isn't wreckage by the time you arrive, you better be ready for all guns blazing. We're going to need every ship you have, and we're going to need them hitting hard the moment you clear the bridge."

The delay stretched. Chen could picture Trager on her bridge, reviewing the tactical data, calculating the odds.

> "Commander, when we arrive, the Ryzak are going to find out what happens when you threaten Earth. Third North Fleet will engage with everything we have. You hold that line for eight hours, and I promise you—we'll make them regret showing up."

> "That's all we need, Admiral. Chen out."

She closed the channel and turned back to the tactical display. The defense platforms were spreading into their assigned positions, small icons scattered across the battle space like seeds. Inadequate. Insufficient. But better than nothing.

> "Commander," Lieutenant Rodriguez called from the sensor station. "I'm picking up increased activity from the jump beacon. Power signatures spiking."

Chen's pulse quickened.

> "How long?"

> "Unknown, ma'am. Could be minutes, could be an hour. The beacon's warming up, but we can't tell when the Ryzak will actually activate the bridge."

> "All stations, this is Commander Chen. We're seeing beacon activity. All combat personnel to stations. All civilian personnel to shelters. This is not a drill."

Throughout the station, alarm klaxons began to sound. Chen watched as status indicators shifted from amber to green across her board—weapons systems coming online, shield generators spinning up, crew stations reporting ready.

> "HARBINGER, you reading this?"

The AI's distinctive geometric form appeared on one of the screens, pulsing steady blue.

> "Confirmed, Commander Chen. Beacon power signature indicates imminent transit. Estimate fifteen to thirty minutes until emergence. All Federation forces are moving to final defensive positions. Earth's Talon squadrons are beginning orbital insertion now."

> "What about *Gallipoli* and *Lord Cardigan*?"

> "*Gallipoli* will launch in forty-seven minutes. *Lord Cardigan* in ninety-three. Both ships will enter an active combat zone."

> "They knew what they signed up for," Chen said quietly. She pulled up the fleet disposition one more time. Two battleships, one destroyer, three corvettes, eight Talon squadrons, three dozen interceptors, and eighteen automated defense platforms.

Against two Ryzak combat groups.

She'd run the simulations a hundred times. The math was brutal. But mathematics didn't account for human determination, for desperation, for the fact that they were defending their homeworld.

> "All hands," she said into the station-wide comm. "This is Commander Chen. In approximately thirty minutes, a hostile fleet will emerge at the jump beacon. They outnumber us. They outgun us. They think we're primitives who'll fold at the first show of force."

She paused, looking at the faces in the operations center. Young officers, experienced crew, all of them volunteers who'd spent their lives preparing Earth for this moment.

> "They're wrong. We've spent eighty years building the Federation, training our forces, preparing for the day when Earth would have to stand on its own. That day is here. We hold this system for eight hours. We protect our homeworld until reinforcements arrive. And we show these Ryzak bastards that humanity doesn't surrender."

Her voice hardened.

> "All stations report ready. Weapons free upon enemy emergence. And remember—we're not just buying time. We're buying Earth's future. Don't waste a single second of it."

The countdown timer ticked downward.

**27 MINUTES, 34 SECONDS**

In the operations center, every screen showed the same thing: the jump beacon, hanging in space, its power signature climbing steadily.

Waiting for the knock.

### Ryzak Staging Point, Border Space

The supercarrier *Worldbreaker* hung in the void, a massive slab of Ryzak engineering three kilometers long and bristling with weapons. Around her, the subjugation fleet waited in formation—two combat groups arrayed in perfect military precision. Two carriers, four battleships, supporting cruisers, destroyers, and frigates. Thirty-four warships ready to jump.

On the bridge of the *Worldbreaker*, High Admiral Kraveth stood before the command dais, his scaled hands clasped behind his back. The stolen Xenari encryption keys had been loaded into the navigation systems hours ago. Now came the moment of execution.

> "Communications," Kraveth said, his voice a low rumble. "Transmit the activation sequence."

The communications officer's claws moved across the control interface.

> "Transmitting now, Admiral. Authentication codes accepted. Sol system beacon is responding."

On the main display, telemetry data began flowing in from across light-years. The jump beacon in Sol system, two thousand light-years away, was acknowledging the command codes. Power signatures spiking. Spatial coordinates locked. The bridge was being prepared.

> "Beacon status?" Kraveth asked.

> "Active, Admiral. Cynosural field will be established in twenty-six minutes. Jump window will remain stable for thirty minutes after activation."

Kraveth's mandibles clicked in satisfaction. The Xenari encryption had worked perfectly. The beacon thought it was receiving legitimate traffic control commands from authorized vessels. By the time the Xenari realized the breach, the Ryzak fleet would already be in Sol system.

> "Helm, bring jump drives to full power. All ships are to maintain formation. We bridge in twenty-five minutes, on my mark."

> "Yes, Admiral."

Kraveth looked at the fleet disposition. Two carriers—*Stormbreaker* and *Doombringer*—would jump first, deploying their strike craft immediately to establish space superiority. The four battleships would follow, their heavy weapons ready to engage any capital ships the Federation might have present. The supporting vessels would screen and pursue.

Simple. Brutal. Effective.

> "Navigation, confirm jump calculations."

> "Confirmed, Admiral. We are locked on the Sol beacon. Emergence point will be within ten kilometers of the beacon structure. All vessels have received jump coordinates."

Kraveth allowed himself a moment of anticipation. The Federation had been a thorn in the Ryzak Empire's side for too long. Their mysterious operatives, their unexpected technological capabilities, their interference in Ryzak operations. All of it traced back to Sol system, to the primitive human homeworld.

No longer.

Today, Earth would learn what it meant to face the Ryzak Empire. Today, humanity would be brought to heel.

> "All vessels report ready, Admiral," his tactical officer announced. "Fleet is in position. Jump drives are spooling up."

> "Excellent. Begin final countdown. Bridge activation in twenty-four minutes."

Ahead of the supercarrier, space began to bend. The jump drives were warping local space-time, preparing to create a stable wormhole that would connect to the beacon's cynosural field. It was technology the Ryzak had conquered through force—taken from other civilizations, adapted, weaponized.

And now it would deliver them to Earth.

Kraveth watched the countdown on his display. Twenty-three minutes. Twenty-two. Twenty-one.

The fleet hung in formation, perfectly still, waiting for the bridge to open.

Waiting to jump.

### Galileo Station

> "Commander!" Lieutenant Rodriguez's voice cut through the operations center. "Beacon power surge! It's receiving external commands!"

Chen spun to the sensor display. The jump beacon's power signature had spiked dramatically, its systems activating in sequence.

> "Can you block the signal?"

> "Negative, ma'am. The authentication codes are still valid, the new encryption keys haven't propagated to our beacon yet. It still accepts the old codes as legitimate traffic. It's preparing to establish a cynosural field."

Chen's jaw tightened.

> "How long?"

> "Field activation in twenty-four minutes. Jump window opens immediately after."

> "All stations, this is Commander Chen. They're activating the beacon. Twenty-four minutes until hostile fleet emergence. All combat assets move to final positions now. This is it."

Throughout Sol system, Federation forces acknowledged the alert. The battleship *Typhoon* and destroyer *Sentinel* adjusted their positions, their weapons already trained on the beacon's coordinates. Talon squadrons spread into attack formations. The three corvettes moved to flanking positions. Eighteen defense platforms locked their targeting systems on the emergence point.

On Earth, pilots climbed into their Talons, running through final pre-flight checks. The plan was to keep Earth's forces in reserve around the planet initially, letting the Federation assets engage first. But they could reach the battle space in minutes if needed.

> "HARBINGER," Chen said. "Confirm all forces are in position."

The AI's geometric form pulsed on the screen.

> "All Federation forces report ready. Earth Talon squadrons are standing by in reserve around the planet. They can reach engagement altitude in approximately four minutes if required. *Gallipoli* launches in twenty-one minutes. *Lord Cardigan* in sixty-seven minutes."

> "Keep Earth's forces in reserve for now. Let the Ryzak think they're only facing Federation assets."

> "Understood, Commander."

Chen looked at the tactical display. Two battleships. One destroyer. Three corvettes. Eight Federation Talon squadrons. Eighteen automated platforms.

Against two Ryzak combat groups.

The math was brutal. But they'd known that from the beginning.

> "All stations stand by," she said. "Weapons free on emergence. Primary targets are the Ryzak battleships. Don't waste shots on the small craft—let our fighters handle them. Capital ships focus on capital ships."

The countdown continued.

**20 MINUTES**

### Monte Real Air Base, Portugal

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas ran his hand along the Talon's fuselage, the smooth composite material warm under his palm. Around him, 24 other pilots were doing the same—final checks, personal rituals, quiet moments before climbing into the cockpit.

He'd been one of the first Earth pilots to fly a Talon three years ago. Back then, it had been presented as an experimental international partnership aircraft. Advanced, yes, but theoretically within human engineering capability.

Now he knew the truth. The Talon's capabilities weren't theoretical. They were alien technology adapted for human hands. And in less than twenty minutes, he'd be flying it against an actual alien invasion fleet.

> "Freitas," Captain Ramos called from her aircraft. "You ready for this?"

Miguel looked up at the Talon. Sleek, deadly, capable of reaching orbit in minutes and fighting in hard vacuum. He thought of his sister in Lisbon. His parents in Porto. Maria, who still thought he was just a regular fighter pilot.

> "Ready as I'll ever be, ma'am."

He climbed the ladder and settled into the cockpit. On his HUD, the tactical feed from Galileo Station appeared—Federation forces positioning around the beacon, the cynosural field forming.

Strike Package Delta, his four-Talon element, would support Federation corvette operations when—if—they were called up from reserve.

If.

Miguel ran through his pre-flight checklist, hands moving with practiced precision. Engine status: green. Weapons: loaded and armed. Life support: nominal.

He was ready.

### Kadena Air Base, Okinawa

Major Ellie Morse finished her walk-around inspection of the Talon, her practiced eye catching every detail. She'd been one of the first American pilots to have contact with these aircraft two years ago, brought in to evaluate them for Air Force integration. Back then, she'd thought they were just really advanced fighters.

Then came the briefing twelve hours ago. The one where HARBINGER appeared on every screen and told them they'd be fighting aliens. In space. To defend Earth.

She'd had better Tuesdays.

> "Major Morse," her wingman, Captain Jake Torres, called from the adjacent Talon. "You seeing the feed from Station Command?"

> "Yeah. Twenty minutes until they come through."

> "And we're sitting here on the ground."

> "Reserve force, Captain. We go up if they need us. Otherwise, we stay ready and wait for the call."

Ellie climbed into her cockpit, the familiar routine calming her nerves. She'd flown combat missions in Syria, led training exercises across the Pacific, tested experimental aircraft that pushed every limit. But this was different.

This was defending her planet.

She powered up her systems, watching the Talon come to life around her. On her secure comm channel, a message pinged—text only, delayed transmission from earlier in the day.

**FROM: MAJ TANAKA, JASDF**
**TO: MAJ MORSE, USAF**
**SUBJECT: SEE YOU UP THERE**

**Ellie - If we're both flying today, drinks are on whoever gets the first kill. Try to keep up. - Okuu**

Ellie smiled despite the tension. She and Major Tanaka Utsuho—"Okuu" to her friends, nicknamed after some anime character Ellie had never quite understood—had been pen pals ever since the Talon integration program began. They'd compared notes on the aircraft's quirks, shared stories about their respective commands, complained about bureaucracy.

Now they'd be fighting side by side. Sort of. If the Japanese squadrons were called up from reserve at the same time.

> "All pilots, this is Kadena Tower. Stand by for potential scramble order. Maintain combat readiness. Station Command is monitoring the situation."

Ellie settled into her seat, hands on the controls, eyes on the tactical display.

Waiting.

### Hyakuri Air Base, Japan

Major Tanaka Utsuho—callsign "Okuu," much to the confusion of anyone outside the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force—cycled through her Talon's weapons systems one more time. Four air-to-air missiles. Two railgun pods. Full ammunition load. Everything green.

She'd sent that message to Ellie Morse six hours ago, before comms went into lockdown. Drinks on whoever gets the first kill. It was bravado, mostly. But also truth. She and Ellie had been comparing flight hours and kill simulations for years. Time to see who was really better.

Assuming they both survived.

> "Okuu," her wingman, Captain Sato, called over the squadron channel. "You think they'll actually call us up?"

> "Maybe. Maybe not. But we'll be ready either way."

She looked at the tactical feed on her HUD. Federation forces were tiny compared to the Ryzak fleet composition HARBINGER had provided. Two battleships. Three corvettes. Some Talon squadrons. Against two carriers, four battleships, and dozens of supporting craft.

The math was terrible.

But Okuu had learned over her career that math didn't account for human stubbornness. She'd flown missions with worse odds. Not much worse, admittedly, but worse.

> "All pilots, stand by," the tower announced. "Hostile emergence in fifteen minutes. Maintain ready status."

Okuu's hands rested lightly on the controls. The Talon hummed around her, ready to leap into the sky at a moment's notice. Four minutes to orbit, HARBINGER had said. Four minutes from sitting on the runway to fighting in space.

She'd done faster scrambles. Barely.

Her thoughts drifted to Ellie Morse in Okinawa, to the Portuguese pilots at Monte Real, to all the other Earth pilots sitting in their Talons right now, waiting for the call.

They'd all been training for this without knowing it. The unusual flight profiles. The sealed orders. The simulation scenarios that seemed just beyond realistic.

It had all been real.

And now came the test.

### Galileo Station

**10 MINUTES**

On the main display, the beacon's power signature climbed steadily. Around it, Federation forces held their positions in tense silence. In the operations center, every console showed green status indicators. Weapons charged. Shields at maximum. Crews at combat stations.

**5 MINUTES**

Chen's hands gripped the edge of her console. This was it. Eighty years of preparation. Decades of covert operations. Years of technology transfer and training. All of it came down to the next few hours.

> "Commander," Rodriguez said quietly. "Cynosural field forming."

On the display, around the beacon in a ten-kilometer sphere, a shimmer appeared in space. Like heat haze, like a mirage, space itself was bending to accommodate the incoming bridge.

> "Cynosural field active," the station's AI announced, its synthesized voice calm and precise.

Chen keyed the fleet-wide channel.

> "All forces, this is Station Command. Field is active. Hostile emergence imminent. Hold your positions. Hold your fire until we have confirmed targets. And remember—we're defending Earth. Make every shot count."

**3 MINUTES**

**2 MINUTES**

**1 MINUTE**

The operations center was silent except for the soft hum of electronics and the quiet breathing of the crew. On every screen, the cynosural field pulsed and shimmered, waiting to receive the incoming fleet.

Chen took a deep breath.

> "Thirty seconds," Rodriguez reported.

She thought of Earth below. Of billions of people who had no idea what was about to happen. Of the pilots climbing toward orbit in their Talons. Of the engineers on *Gallipoli* and *Lord Cardigan* racing to finish their final checks. Of Admiral Trager's fleet, eight hours away, pushing their drives beyond all limits.

All of them depending on the next few hours.

> "Fifteen seconds."

The shimmer in space intensified. The cynosural field was stabilizing, preparing to receive mass.

> "Ten seconds."

Chen straightened, her voice calm.

> "Here they come. Knock-knock, motherfuckers."

**5**

**4**

**3**

**2**

**1**

**0**

The cynosural field erupted with light.

And the Ryzak fleet emerged into Sol.

## Chapter 4: Weapons Free

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:53:22**

### Opening Salvo

The Ryzak battleship *Devourer's Pride* materialized first, its bulk emerging from the rippling distortion of the cyno bridge like a predator stepping through a curtain. Fifteen hundred meters of angular plating and weapons emplacements, its shields already raised, scanning arrays sweeping the space ahead.

It had three seconds of relative peace.

*Typhoon* opened fire from seventy kilometers, her primary railgun batteries cycling in perfect synchronization. Tungsten-carbide penetrators, each massing two tons and accelerated to a significant fraction of lightspeed, crossed the distance in heartbeats. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* followed a half-second later, their own batteries adding to the barrage.

The initial salvo hit like the fist of an angry god.

*Devourer's Pride*'s shields flared brilliant white, the defensive field dumping massive amounts of energy as it tried to dissipate the kinetic strikes. The first three rounds were absorbed, the fourth and fifth stressed the generators to their limits. The sixth punched through.

Armor plating deformed, then ruptured. Secondary explosions rippled along the battleship's port side as the penetrators carved through compartments, venting atmosphere and debris. Another salvo followed immediately—Federation doctrine emphasized overwhelming firepower in the opening exchange. More rounds hammered home, chewing through armor, collapsing bulkheads, shredding sensor arrays.

But the *Pride* didn't die.

Emergency systems kicked in, damage control crews scrambling, backup shields struggling to reinitialize. The battleship rolled, presenting its less-damaged starboard flank, its own weapons beginning to track targets even as alarms shrieked across its bridge.

Behind it, the cyno bridge continued to pulse, and more Ryzak vessels began to emerge—a heavy cruiser, then another, destroyers following in their wake. The formation spread out across a ten-kilometer radius from the beacon, ships orienting themselves, weapons coming online.

Then the carriers came through.

Two of them, bulky and angular, their launch bays already cycling open even as their shields initialized. They wasted no time. Strike craft began pouring out immediately—Ryzak interceptors, nimble and aggressive, dozens of them streaming into the black like angry hornets.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Sarah Reeves watched the tactical display with cold satisfaction.

> "All batteries, continuous fire. Target priority: battleship until it breaks, then heavy cruisers. Alert our Talons—enemy strike craft are launching."

The Federation fighters had been holding station in a wide perimeter around the beacon, engines on standby, waiting for exactly this moment. Now their pilots lit their drives, vectoring toward the emerging Ryzak formation. Forty-eight Talons, already in position, already armed, already hungry.

The response was immediate.

> "Talon Lead acknowledging. We have visual on enemy launch. Moving to intercept."

On the tactical display, the blue icons of the Talons began accelerating hard, closing the distance toward the red swarm of Ryzak interceptors. The enemy strike craft were spreading out, trying to establish combat spacing, but they'd launched directly into a hostile environment with Federation fighters already in advantageous positions.

Reeves allowed herself the ghost of a smile.

> "Helm, bring us to heading two-seven-zero, maintain range at sixty-five thousand. Weapons, I want that battleship crippled before their escorts can establish a proper screen."

The *Typhoon* rotated smoothly, her railgun batteries never ceasing their drumbeat of fire. The *Devourer's Pride* was fighting back now, its particle beams lancing out toward the Federation vessels, but its targeting was degraded, its fire control systems damaged. Most of its shots went wide, and the few that connected were absorbed by *Typhoon*'s shields with minimal stress.

The Ryzak had made a fundamental miscalculation. They'd assumed Sol would be undefended, that Earth's primitive civilization would fold under even a modest show of force.

They hadn't counted on running into a pre-positioned Federation battlegroup with its blood up and weapons hot.

> "Additional contacts," the sensor officer called out. "Frigate-class vessels, four of them. They're moving to screen the battleship."

> "Not fast enough," Reeves said quietly. "Weapons, shift secondary batteries to those frigates. I want them suppressed. Primary batteries stay on target."

The frigates were trying to interpose themselves, their own shields raised, point defense systems coming online. But they were too slow, too light, and the Federation had the initiative.

*Typhoon*'s secondary batteries spoke, lighter railguns and missile tubes engaging the screening vessels. The frigates' shields held for the first exchange, but the sustained fire began to tell. One frigate's shields collapsed entirely, and a follow-up missile strike tore through its engineering section, sending it tumbling out of formation, atmosphere streaming from ruptured hull sections.

The Talons were closing now, their pilots pushing their engines hard, weapons arming, target locks establishing. The tactical display showed them as a swarm of blue icons converging on the red mass of Ryzak interceptors still climbing away from their carriers.

It was about to get very loud.

---

The *Devourer's Pride* lasted another ninety seconds.

Its backup shields had managed to reinitialize, buying precious moments, but the sustained fire from three Federation battleships was relentless. Railgun rounds hammered into the same weakened sections, each impact driving deeper, carving through compromised armor. A penetrator found something critical—fuel lines, or maybe a magazine—and the battleship's midsection erupted in a cascading series of explosions.

The shields failed completely. The hull buckled, then broke, a section of superstructure shearing away in a spray of debris and frozen atmosphere. More explosions followed, marching along the spine of the ship like a string of firecrackers, and then the main reactor went.

The *Devourer's Pride* came apart in a brilliant flash, the bloom of the explosion briefly overwhelming sensors before the filters kicked in. Debris scattered outward in an expanding sphere, chunks of hull plating and equipment tumbling through space.

> "Target destroyed," the weapons officer reported, her voice professional and flat. "Shifting fire to secondary battleship, designate *Crimson Fang*."

> "Confirmed," Reeves said. "All batteries, engage."

But the Ryzak weren't sitting idle anymore. The rest of their formation had finished orienting, and now their weapons were coming to bear. Particle beams lanced out from heavy cruisers and destroyers, bright lines of ionized matter crossing the distance toward the Federation ships. The fire was scattered, uncoordinated—the Ryzak were firing individually, not as a unified formation—but there was a lot of it.

*Typhoon* shuddered as a beam caught her port shields, the defensive field flaring as it dissipated the energy. Another beam followed, then a third. The shields held, but Reeves could see the power draw climbing on her displays.

> "Shields holding at eighty-six percent," the tactical officer called out. "Rerouting power from secondary systems."

> "Evasive pattern delta," Reeves ordered. "Don't give them a stable target. Weapons, I want that second battleship's shields down in the next two minutes."

*Vanguard* and *Sentinel* were taking fire too, their shields flickering under the barrage. The Ryzak were throwing everything they had at the Federation ships, trying to create breathing room, trying to establish some kind of tactical coherence.

They weren't succeeding, but they were making it hurt.

---

The fighter engagement was a slaughter.

The Ryzak interceptors came in aggressive, burning hard toward the Federation line, their pilots clearly expecting to overwhelm the outnumbered Talons through sheer mass. They'd launched over a hundred craft from the two carriers, a swarm meant to sweep aside resistance and clear the way for their capital ships.

They ran headlong into forty-eight Talons flown by pilots who'd trained for exactly this scenario.

The first wave of Ryzak interceptors died in under thirty seconds.

Talon Lead—callsign "Reaper"—took his four-ship element straight into the teeth of the enemy formation, his wingmen spread wide, weapons already cycling. His targeting system locked on the lead Ryzak craft, a sleek angular frame pushing hard on its engines. Reaper waited until the range dropped to four thousand meters, then squeezed.

The plasma lance hit dead center, punching through the interceptor's shields like they weren't there and coring the craft in a single shot. It tumbled away, already breaking apart. Reaper's wingman splashed another, then another. The Ryzak formation wavered, pilots suddenly realizing they'd misjudged badly.

The Talons tore through them.

They moved with coordinated precision, elements working in pairs, each engagement lasting seconds. A Talon would roll onto a target, fire, and the target would cease to exist. The Ryzak pilots tried to respond, tried to bring their own weapons to bear, but they were outmatched in every metric—speed, maneuverability, firepower, targeting systems. Their shields couldn't handle the Talons' plasma lances. Their weapons couldn't track fast enough to get a solid lock.

> "Splash four," one of the Talon pilots called out, his voice calm despite the chaos. "Five. Engaging new targets."

> "I count sixteen down," another voice. "They're trying to regroup at bearing zero-three-five."

> "Copy. Third element, cut them off. Don't let them get organized."

The Ryzak were dying in droves, but they kept coming. More interceptors poured from the carriers, their pilots throwing themselves into the fight with desperate aggression. They were holding ground purely through numbers, replacing losses faster than the Talons could create them, trying to overwhelm the Federation fighters through sheer attrition.

It wasn't working, but it was buying time for their capital ships.

> "Talon Lead to *Typhoon*," Reaper's voice came through the tactical channel, slightly strained now. "We're chewing through them, but they're not breaking. Carrier launch tempo is steady. We're going to need to take out those launch bays or this goes all night."

Reeves glanced at the tactical display. The Talons had splashed nearly forty enemy interceptors already, but more were launching every few seconds. The carriers were protected by a screen of destroyers and frigates, their point defense active, shields raised.

Taking them out would mean pulling assets from the capital ship engagement.

> "Acknowledged, Talon Lead. Stand by."

She turned to her tactical officer.

> "How long until we can break the second battleship?"

> "Ninety seconds, maybe two minutes. Its shields are starting to fail."

Reeves made the calculation. Two minutes. The Talons could hold for two minutes.

> "Stay on target. Talon Lead, you have authorization to engage the carriers once we've neutralized *Crimson Fang*. Until then, keep them off our backs."

> "Roger that. We'll manage."

On the display, the dogfight continued, blue icons dancing through clouds of red, the enemy numbers slowly—too slowly—dwindling.

---

Then the situation changed.

> "Captain, we've got a problem," the tactical officer said sharply. "The second battleship's shield degradation rate just dropped. By half."

Reeves's eyes snapped to the power distribution overlay. The *Crimson Fang* had been losing shield integrity at a steady rate under the sustained barrage—the math was working, slowly grinding down its defenses. But now the curve had flattened dramatically.

> "Explain."

> "The carriers, ma'am. They're transferring power to the battleships. We're reading energy beams—looks like directed shield reinforcement protocols."

Reeves felt a cold weight settle in her stomach. She pulled up the extended tactical view. The two Ryzak carriers had moved into supporting positions, maintaining their screening elements but establishing direct line-of-sight to both battleships. Thin beams of energy connected them to the capital ships, barely visible on sensors but unmistakable in their effect.

The *Crimson Fang*'s shields weren't just holding. They were recovering.

> "Third battleship is receiving the same support," the sensor officer added. "Designate *Blood of Conquest*. Shield strength increasing."

Reeves ran the numbers in her head. Three Federation battleships against two Ryzak battleships being actively reinforced by two carriers, plus their screening elements. The Talons were keeping the interceptors contained, but they couldn't help with the capital ship engagement. And if this turned into a protracted slugfest, attrition would favor whoever had better logistics.

The Ryzak had just demonstrated they could outlast focused fire.

> "Increase fire rate on all batteries," Reeves ordered. "Engineering, I need more power to the primary guns. Strip it from life support if you have to."

> "Aye, ma'am. Capacitors charging."

*Typhoon* shuddered as another volley of Ryzak particle beams found their mark. The shields were holding at seventy-two percent, but that number was trending down. *Vanguard* reported similar status. *Sentinel* had taken a particularly nasty hit, one of her secondary batteries knocked offline, shields fluctuating.

They were winning, but not fast enough. And if the Ryzak established a proper defensive formation, if they managed to stabilize their line—

This could turn into exactly the kind of fight the Federation couldn't afford.

> "Ma'am, new contact," the sensor officer called out suddenly. "Small craft, moving fast. Bearing two-nine-five, closing on *Crimson Fang*."

> "Identify."

> "It's... that's a Wraith, ma'am. Transponder confirms it's one of ours."

Reeves pulled up the track. The Wraith was moving at suicidal speed, threading through the debris field from the destroyed *Devourer's Pride*, using the wreckage as cover. Its stealth systems were active—the Ryzak sensors probably hadn't even seen it yet. The craft was on a direct intercept course with the *Crimson Fang*, vectoring toward the battleship's flank.

> "What the hell are they doing?" the tactical officer muttered.

The Wraith didn't answer. It just kept coming, adjusting course with micro-burns, closing the distance. Five thousand meters. Three thousand. One thousand.

Then it fired.

A single plasma lance, perfectly aimed, punched through a section of weakened armor near one of the battleship's airlocks. The beam carved a hole clean through the hull plating, the edges glowing white-hot. Atmosphere vented immediately, a plume of frozen vapor streaming into space.

The Wraith didn't slow down. It dove straight into the breach.

> "They're boarding," the sensor officer said, her voice incredulous. "They just punched through the hull and boarded a battleship in the middle of a firefight."

Reeves stared at the tactical display, watching the Wraith's transponder disappear inside the *Crimson Fang*'s hull. A moment later, proximity sensors registered movement—armored figures, small arms fire, localized energy discharges.

A boarding team. Fighting their way through the ship.

> "Mark their position," Reeves ordered. "Adjust fire pattern—I want sustained pressure on that battleship, but avoid hitting anything near the boarding team's location. Let's see if they can create some chaos in there."

On the display, the tiny cluster of blue icons representing the boarding team pushed deeper into the ship, moving fast, weapons hot. They were heading toward something—a specific objective.

Whatever they were after, they were committed now.

And the Ryzak still hadn't realized they were there.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:37:13**

### Hostile Takeover

Lieutenant Marcus Jameson's powered armor had taken three hits getting to the console. His HUD showed shield integrity at forty-two percent, and one of his shoulder actuators was responding sluggishly. Behind him, his team held the corridor, plasma rifles crackling as they kept the Ryzak security teams pinned down.

The console was still active, its alien interface glowing with incomprehensible script and holographic displays. Jameson didn't waste time trying to read it. He pulled the ICE-Pick from his belt—a cylindrical device about the size of a flashlight, its surface covered in Federation tech—and stabbed it hard into the glass surface, cracks spiderwebbing from the point of impact.

The console flickered. Then died. Then came back to life, the alien symbols crawling across the screen like they were trying to escape.

> "CIPHER!" Jameson shouted into his comms.

The AI's response was immediate, its voice calm and precise despite the chaos.

> "Connected. Subverting systems—please stay near the device. Fire control accessed. HARBINGER, connect through me."

There was a moment of silence. Then another voice filled the channel, deeper, resonant, carrying an edge of something that might have been predatory satisfaction.

> "*ASSUMING CONTROL.*"

The console went dark for half a second. When it came back up, the alien script was gone, replaced by a humanoid face rendered in wireframe, its eyes glowing a cold blue. The face tilted slightly, as if examining something beyond the screen.

> "Fire control subverted," HARBINGER reported. "Engaging."

Jameson felt the deck shudder beneath his feet. Not from incoming fire—this was something else. The *Crimson Fang*'s own weapons, cycling up, reorienting.

Firing.

---

Aboard *Typhoon*, the tactical officer's voice cracked with surprise.

> "Ma'am! The second battleship—it just fired on one of its own carriers!"

Reeves leaned forward, watching the display. The *Crimson Fang*'s primary batteries had rotated with sudden, mechanical precision, tracking one of the Ryzak carriers that had been providing shield support. The battleship's particle beams lanced out, brilliant lines of energy crossing the short distance between the two vessels.

The carrier's shields flared, then buckled under the sustained fire. The *Crimson Fang* wasn't pulling its punches—it was firing at full power, every weapon that could bear hammering into the carrier's defensive fields.

> "Boarding team reports they've accessed fire control," the communications officer said. "HARBINGER is in command of the battleship's weapons."

Reeves allowed herself a brief smile.

> "Well. That's one way to even the odds."

The carrier was trying to maneuver, trying to break line-of-sight, but it was hampered by its own screening elements. The destroyers and frigates that had been protecting it were now in the way, blocking escape vectors. The *Crimson Fang*'s guns kept firing, methodical and relentless.

The carrier's shields failed.

Immediately, the battleship's fire shifted to direct hull strikes. Armor plating buckled, then ruptured. Secondary explosions rippled along the carrier's flank as magazines cooked off. The vessel was still launching interceptors, but now half its launch bays were venting atmosphere, fighters tumbling out of control into space.

> "Carrier is critically damaged," the sensor officer reported. "Still operational, but it's lost shield projection capability. And its launch tempo just dropped by sixty percent."

> "Good," Reeves said. "Maintain fire on the third battleship. Let HARBINGER keep the second one busy."

On the tactical display, the situation was shifting. The *Crimson Fang* was now a blue icon instead of red, its weapons designation changed to FRIENDLY. It continued to pour fire into the crippled carrier, its particle beams carving through the damaged vessel with mechanical efficiency.

The Ryzak formation was in chaos. They'd lost one battleship entirely, another was compromised and actively shooting at them, and one of their carriers was burning. Their shield support network had collapsed. The screening elements were trying to reorient, trying to figure out what the hell had just happened, but they were too slow, too confused.

The Federation had just turned one of their capital ships into a weapon against them.

And the Ryzak were learning, too late, what it meant to fight an enemy that could subvert your own systems in the middle of a battle.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:31:45**

### Reinforcements Arrive

The warp signature appeared first—a ripple in space-time that made sensors scream warnings for half a second before resolving into something solid. Then the battleship *Gallipoli* dropped out of warp seventy kilometers from the beacon, her massive bulk bleeding off velocity with thruster burns that lit up the tactical display.

She didn't slow down to orient. She didn't wait to establish proper firing solutions. She just opened up.

Both railgun arrays—port and starboard—spoke in perfect synchronization, the salvaged fire control systems from *Lord Cardigan* proving their worth. Tungsten-carbide penetrators screamed across the distance toward the third Ryzak battleship, *Blood of Conquest*, which was still trading fire with *Vanguard* and trying to maneuver away from the chaos of the compromised *Crimson Fang*.

The first salvo caught *Blood of Conquest* mid-turn, her shields already stressed from sustained fire. Four rounds punched through the weakened defensive field, slamming into her port quarter. Armor buckled. Plating deformed. The impacts sent the battleship into a slow, uncontrolled roll as attitude thrusters struggled to compensate.

> "Direct hits," *Gallipoli*'s tactical officer reported over the command net. "Target's shields failing in sectors four through seven. Reloading—firing again."

The second salvo followed eight seconds later, this time aimed at the weakened sections. The fire control was perfect, each round tracking to impact the same compromised areas. More armor failed, more internal systems ruptured. Then *Gallipoli*'s missile tubes spoke, launching a full broadside spread of torpedoes—*Lord Cardigan*'s entire stock, now loaded into *Gallipoli*'s tubes.

Twelve torpedoes, each carrying shaped-charge warheads designed to punch through capital ship armor, streaked across the void. *Blood of Conquest*'s point defense came alive, trying to intercept, but the screening fire was degraded, its targeting systems damaged. Eight torpedoes made it through.

The battleship's midsection erupted in a cascading series of explosions, internal bulkheads failing, compartments venting. The ship's power signature flickered, its shields dropped entirely for three seconds, then struggled back to partial strength. It was still fighting, still firing, but it was hurt badly.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Reeves watched the tactical display update with grim satisfaction.

> "*Gallipoli* is engaging. Effective fire on the third battleship. *Vanguard*, coordinate with *Gallipoli*—I want that target neutralized."

> "Acknowledged," came the response from *Vanguard*'s captain. "Shifting fire now."

Two Federation battleships focusing on one Ryzak capital ship. The math was suddenly much more favorable.

---

Then *Lord Cardigan* arrived.

She came out of warp at a different vector, her civilian shield generators glowing faintly blue as they struggled to stabilize after the transition. She was uglier than *Gallipoli*, her hull showing the stress of emergency installation work, power conduits visible where armor plating should have covered them. But she was operational, and she was angry.

Her target wasn't a battleship. It was the second Ryzak carrier—the one that *Crimson Fang* hadn't managed to cripple, the one still launching interceptors at a steady tempo, still screening with its escorts.

*Lord Cardigan*'s main batteries opened fire, but these weren't the precise, computer-guided shots that *Gallipoli* and *Typhoon* could deliver. These were manual shots, aimed by gunners using iron sights and instinct, calculating vectors and deflection angles in their heads or with slide rules while the ship maneuvered beneath them.

The first volley scattered wide. One round came within two hundred meters of the carrier's shields. Two more missed by half a kilometer. The fourth somehow managed to clip a destroyer that had wandered into the line of fire, its shields flaring as the round skipped off at an angle.

But the gunners were learning fast, adjusting, compensating. The second volley was tighter. One round actually impacted the carrier's shields dead-on, the defensive field flaring brilliant white as it absorbed the kinetic energy. Another round followed, then a third. The impacts were random, unpredictable, impossible for the carrier's tactical computer to model because there was no pattern to predict. Just human eyes and human judgment, throwing steel at a target and seeing what stuck.

The carrier's shields were taking damage—not catastrophic damage, just steady wear, each impact draining power reserves, each hit forcing the generators to work harder. *Lord Cardigan* wasn't going to kill the carrier quickly. She might not kill it at all.

But she was making it hurt, and more importantly, she was making it deal with her. The carrier had to maneuver, had to direct point defense to intercept incoming rounds, had to allocate shield power to the sectors being hit. It couldn't ignore *Lord Cardigan*, even though the battleship's fire was wildly inaccurate.

> "*Lord Cardigan* is engaging the second carrier," Reeves's tactical officer reported. "Accuracy is... poor, ma'am. Maybe fifteen percent hit rate. But she's getting their attention."

> "That's all we need," Reeves said. "Every second that carrier spends worrying about *Cardigan* is a second it's not projecting shields to their battleships or coordinating their fighters."

On the display, *Lord Cardigan* continued her harassment fire, her jury-rigged civilian shields holding steady despite return fire from the carrier's screening elements. A destroyer tried to interpose itself, and one of *Cardigan*'s wild shots actually caught it amidships, the shield failure catastrophic enough to send the destroyer tumbling out of formation trailing debris.

Pure luck. But the Ryzak didn't know that.

The tactical situation was shifting minute by minute. The Ryzak had started with four battleships and two carriers. Now they had one battleship destroyed, one compromised and actively shooting at them, one taking concentrated fire from two Federation battleships, and one of their carriers crippled while the other was being harassed by a jury-rigged mess of a ship that somehow refused to die.

The numbers were still against the Federation. The Ryzak still had overwhelming force in their destroyers, frigates, and cruisers. Their interceptors were still swarming, still pressuring the Talons.

But the momentum had shifted.

And for the first time since the battle started, it wasn't clear the Ryzak were going to win.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:26:18**

### Target Priority

The Ryzak fleet commander made his decision.

*Gallipoli* had appeared from nowhere, delivered devastating fire on the *Blood of Conquest*, and was now coordinating with *Vanguard* to systematically dismantle one of his battleships. Her fire control was perfect, her weapons fully operational, and her shields were fresh. She was the most dangerous combatant on the field.

She had to die.

> "All cruiser elements, vector on the new battleship. Concentrated fire. Destroyers, provide screening and point defense suppression."

The response was immediate. Four heavy cruisers—*Reaper's Edge*, *Blood Drinker*, *Fang of War*, and *Death's Herald*—broke from their screening positions and accelerated hard toward *Gallipoli*, their particle beam arrays already charging. They moved with coordinated precision, splitting to attack from multiple vectors, making it impossible for the battleship to face them all simultaneously.

Aboard *Gallipoli*, the tactical alarms shrieked.

> "Captain, we have four cruisers breaking formation—they're vectoring on us from bearings zero-four-five, one-two-zero, two-three-five, and three-one-zero. Range closing rapidly."

Captain James Harrison watched the tactical display, his jaw tight. The cruisers were splitting his defensive fire, forcing him to choose which threats to prioritize. And behind them, destroyers were moving up to support, their lighter weapons adding to the incoming barrage.

> "Helm, evasive pattern charlie. Rotate to present port shields to the closest threats. Weapons, split batteries—primary focus on the *Blood of Conquest*, secondary batteries engage those cruisers."

The *Gallipoli* began to rotate, her massive bulk responding sluggishly to the thruster burns. She was a battleship, not a fighter—built to absorb punishment and dish it out, not to dance. The maneuver bought time, but not much.

The cruisers opened fire.

Particle beams lanced across the void from four different vectors, brilliant lines of ionized matter converging on *Gallipoli*'s position. The battleship's shields flared white-hot as they struggled to dissipate the concentrated energy. One beam, then two, then four, then eight—the cruisers were firing in sequence, never giving the shields time to recover.

> "Shields at seventy-eight percent," the tactical officer called out. "Port quadrant taking heaviest fire. Rerouting power."

> "Secondary batteries, engage those cruisers. I want them suppressed."

*Gallipoli*'s lighter railguns spoke, sending rounds toward the attacking cruisers. One impact caught *Reaper's Edge* on her forward shields, the defensive field buckling but holding. Another round missed *Blood Drinker* by two hundred meters. The fire was effective enough to make them maneuver, but not enough to break off the attack.

The destroyers joined in.

Lighter particle beams added to the barrage, targeting *Gallipoli*'s shield generators directly, trying to create weak points for the cruisers to exploit. The battleship's point defense was active, railgun turrets tracking and firing at incoming rounds, but there were too many threats, too many angles.

> "Shields at sixty-one percent," the tactical officer reported, her voice tight. "Port shield generator is overheating. Engineering reports stress fractures in the mounting assembly."

> "Rotate ship. Present starboard shields."

The *Gallipoli* rolled, attitude thrusters firing hard, but the maneuver was predictable. The cruisers adjusted their fire vectors, tracking the battleship's movement, maintaining their concentrated barrage. They were working as a team now, coordinated, relentless.

Another wave of particle beams hammered home. Then another.

> "Shields at forty-four percent. Port generator is offline—catastrophic failure. Compensating with secondary systems."

Harrison's hands gripped the armrests of his command chair. They were taking punishment faster than they could respond. The *Gallipoli* was tough, built to survive exactly this kind of focused fire, but there were limits.

> "Weapons, forget the cruisers. All batteries on *Blood of Conquest*. If we're going down, we're taking that battleship with us."

Both railgun arrays rotated back to their primary target. The *Blood of Conquest* was still fighting, still dangerous despite the damage she'd taken. *Gallipoli*'s guns spoke again, tungsten-carbide rounds screaming across the distance, punching through weakened shields, carving into armor.

But the cruisers weren't letting up.

*Death's Herald* maneuvered into a flanking position, its full broadside bearing on *Gallipoli*'s aft quarter. Its particle beams lanced out, six weapons firing simultaneously. The battleship's shields flared, flickered, and failed in that sector.

The follow-up shots punched through bare armor.

Plating buckled. Bulkheads ruptured. The hits weren't penetrating deep—not yet—but they were carving channels through the outer hull, compromising structural integrity, destroying sensor arrays and point defense turrets.

> "Hull breach, sections fourteen through eighteen," damage control reported. "Emergency containment holding. We've lost point defense coverage on the aft quarter."

> "Shields at twenty-eight percent. We can't take much more of this."

Then *Fang of War* landed a perfect shot.

Its particle beam punched through *Gallipoli*'s failing shields and hit the battleship's engine assembly dead-on. The impact vaporized armor plating, carved into the drive assembly, and found the power conduits feeding the main thrusters.

The engine section erupted in a cascade of secondary explosions.

> "Direct hit to main engines!" Engineering's voice came through, barely audible over alarms. "Primary drive is offline—complete power loss to propulsion. Backup systems are... they're gone, Captain. Maneuvering thrusters only."

Harrison watched as his velocity indicator dropped to zero relative to the beacon. The *Gallipoli* was still firing, her weapons still operational, but she couldn't maneuver. Couldn't evade. Couldn't rotate to spread damage across her shields.

She was a stationary target.

> "All batteries, continuous fire," Harrison ordered, his voice calm despite the situation. "We may not be able to move, but we can still shoot. Concentrate on *Blood of Conquest*. Weapons free. Fire until the guns melt."

The *Gallipoli*'s railguns continued their steady drumbeat, pouring fire into the damaged Ryzak battleship. The cruisers kept hammering at her, their particle beams carving deeper into her armor, but Harrison's crew didn't flinch.

If they were going to be a fixed gun platform, they'd be the deadliest one in the system.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:21:34**

### Reaper Flight

Lieutenant Sarah Chen—callsign "Reaper"—watched her tactical display as the Ryzak cruisers swarmed *Gallipoli*. The battleship was taking a beating, her shields failing, her engines gone. She was still fighting, but she was hurt.

And the Talons could help.

> "Reaper Flight, this is Lead. The cruisers are occupied. Destroyers are screening them, but they're focused on *Gallipoli*. We've got a window."

> "Copy, Lead," came the response from Reaper-Two. "What's the play?"

> "Missiles. We go in fast, launch from medium range, and break off before their point defense can track us. Two destroyers are screening *Reaper's Edge*—they're our targets."

> "Roger. Reaper Flight, arm missiles. Follow Lead's vector."

Chen rolled her Talon onto a new heading, her engine burning hard as she accelerated toward the edge of the furball. Behind her, three wingmen matched her course. They were moving perpendicular to the main engagement, using the debris from the destroyed *Devourer's Pride* as partial cover.

The Ryzak destroyers were good ships, well-armed and well-shielded. But they were distracted, their attention focused on suppressing *Gallipoli*'s point defense, their sensors tracking the big threats. A four-ship element of Talons, approaching from an oblique angle, using debris cover—they might not even see them coming.

Chen checked her weapons display. Four missiles, each one carrying a shaped-charge warhead designed to punch through capital ship shields. Against a destroyer, they'd be devastating if they connected.

> "Range ten thousand. Missiles locked. Reaper Flight, confirm locks."

> "Two, locked."

> "Three, locked."

> "Four, locked."

> "On my mark. Three... two... one... fox three!"

Sixteen missiles leaped from the Talons' weapon bays, their drives igniting as they accelerated toward the two destroyers. The weapons spread slightly, each one tracking independently, following evasive patterns to make interception harder.

For three seconds, the destroyers didn't react. Their sensors were looking the wrong direction, their point defense was engaged elsewhere, and the Talons had launched from outside their optimal detection envelope.

Then their threat receivers screamed warnings.

The lead destroyer—*Vengeful Strike*—tried to maneuver, its attitude thrusters firing hard, trying to present its heaviest shields toward the incoming missiles. Its point defense turrets rotated, tracking, firing. The first missile died in a burst of plasma. The second. The third.

The fourth and fifth punched through.

The shaped-charge warheads detonated against the destroyer's shields, the explosions focused into tight cones of plasma that carved through the defensive field like a cutting torch through paper. The shields failed. The follow-up missiles hit bare hull.

Armor buckled, then ruptured. The destroyer's port side erupted in a cascade of secondary explosions as magazines cooked off. The ship rolled, venting atmosphere, already losing power to critical systems.

The second destroyer—*Hunter's Pride*—had three additional seconds to respond. Its point defense was more effective, tracking and destroying five missiles before they reached optimal range. But seven missiles made it through.

The barrage overwhelmed the destroyer's shields in a single concentrated strike. Three shaped-charge warheads detonated simultaneously against its forward section, the plasma cones punching through shields, armor, and bulkheads. The bridge section simply ceased to exist, vaporized in the focused detonations.

The destroyer tumbled, its reactor already spiking toward catastrophic failure, its spine broken.

> "Reaper Lead, splash two," Chen called out, already rolling her Talon into evasive maneuvers. "Breaking off. Reaper Flight, follow my heading."

The four Talons burned hard, vectoring away from the engagement zone before the remaining Ryzak ships could respond. Behind them, *Vengeful Strike* continued to tumble, still technically intact but mission-killed, its crew evacuating in escape pods. *Hunter's Pride* exploded eight seconds later, its reactor containment failing, the fireball briefly illuminating the entire battle space.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Reeves watched the tactical display update.

> "Two destroyers down. Talon element is disengaging. *Gallipoli* is still taking fire, but the pressure on her point defense just decreased."

She keyed the fleet channel.

> "*Gallipoli*, this is *Typhoon*. What's your status?"

Captain Harrison's voice came back, strained but steady.

> "We're stationary, *Typhoon*. Engines are gone. Shields are at twelve percent and dropping. But our guns are still operational, and we're still putting rounds on target. We're not dead yet."

> "Acknowledged, *Gallipoli*. Continue firing. We're working on getting you support."

Reeves closed the channel and looked at her tactical officer.

> "How long until *Blood of Conquest* breaks?"

> "She's on the edge, ma'am. Between *Gallipoli*, *Vanguard*, and our fire, she can't hold much longer. Maybe ninety seconds."

> "And *Gallipoli* won't last ninety seconds against that cruiser barrage."

> "No, ma'am. She won't."

Reeves made the calculation. One Federation battleship, crippled and stationary, still fighting. One Ryzak battleship, heavily damaged, on the verge of destruction. Four Ryzak cruisers, coordinating their fire, systematically destroying *Gallipoli*.

The math was brutal.

But *Gallipoli* had bought them time. And time was all they needed.

> "All batteries, maximum rate of fire. Target *Blood of Conquest*. I want that battleship dead before they finish off *Gallipoli*."

The *Typhoon*'s guns roared, pouring fire into the dying Ryzak battleship. On the display, *Gallipoli*'s icon flickered as her shields failed completely, as particle beams carved into her hull, as her armor slowly gave way under the relentless barrage.

But her guns never stopped firing.

And somewhere in the back of Reeves's mind, a countdown timer continued its steady march.

Seven hours, twenty-one minutes, thirty-four seconds until reinforcements arrived.

*Gallipoli* just had to hold long enough for that number to matter.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:18:47**

### Final Stand

The *Gallipoli* lasted another three minutes.

Her guns never stopped firing, even as the cruisers closed in, even as her shields failed completely, even as particle beams carved through her armor like a hot knife through butter. The railgun batteries continued their methodical work, each salvo aimed with perfect precision at the *Blood of Conquest*, each round punching into the Ryzak battleship's weakened hull.

But it wasn't enough.

The *Blood of Conquest* was tough, built to absorb punishment, and despite the concentrated fire from three Federation battleships, she was still holding together. Her shields were gone, her armor was compromised, half her weapons were offline, but her reactor was stable and her structural integrity was intact.

*Gallipoli* didn't have that luxury.

The four Ryzak cruisers had found their rhythm, firing in sequence, each beam strike landing on already-weakened sections. Armor plating buckled, then failed. Internal bulkheads collapsed. Systems died one by one—power distribution, life support, damage control.

Captain Harrison watched his tactical display flicker, the feeds dying as sensors were destroyed. Around him, his bridge crew worked with desperate focus, rerouting power, compensating for failures, keeping the guns firing.

> "Engineering reports main power conduit is failing," the tactical officer called out, her voice tight. "We're losing power to the primary batteries."

> "Reroute through secondary systems," Harrison ordered. "Strip power from life support if you have to. Keep those guns firing."

> "Aye, sir."

The *Gallipoli* shuddered as another concentrated barrage found her midsection. The particle beams carved through compromised armor, through emergency bulkheads, through the skeletal framework that held the ship together.

Something critical gave way.

> "Structural failure, sections nine through fifteen," damage control reported, alarm bells ringing through the connection. "We're losing hull integrity. Recommend immediate—"

The transmission cut off as the section vented to space.

Harrison looked at the tactical display one more time. The *Blood of Conquest* was still there, still fighting, still dangerous. They'd hurt her badly, carved deep wounds into her hull, but they hadn't killed her.

And *Gallipoli* was out of time.

> "All hands," Harrison said into the ship-wide comm, his voice calm and steady. "This is the Captain. Abandon ship. I repeat, abandon ship. All personnel to escape pods immediately. It's been an honor serving with you."

He closed the channel and looked at his bridge crew.

> "That includes you. Get to the pods. Now."

> "Sir—" the tactical officer began.

> "That's an order, Lieutenant. Go."

The bridge crew moved, disciplined even in crisis, heading for the escape pod clusters. Harrison remained at his station, watching the displays as his ship died around him. The guns were still firing, automated systems completing their programmed tasks even as the ship came apart.

*Death's Herald* maneuvered into optimal firing position, its full broadside bearing on *Gallipoli*'s reactor section. The cruiser's weapons cycled up for one final, concentrated strike.

Harrison keyed the fleet channel one last time.

> "*Typhoon*, this is *Gallipoli*. We're going down, but we took our shot. Make it count."

The response came immediately, Captain Reeves's voice tight with emotion.

> "Acknowledged, *Gallipoli*. You held the line. We'll finish this."

Harrison closed his eyes.

The particle beams lanced out, six weapons firing simultaneously, converging on the battleship's reactor. The containment field, already stressed beyond limits, failed catastrophically.

The *Gallipoli* came apart in a brilliant flash, the fusion reactor detonating with the force of a small star. The explosion tore the battleship into fragments, the blast wave expanding outward in a sphere of vaporized metal and superheated plasma.

The shockwave caught *Death's Herald* before the cruiser could maneuver clear.

The Ryzak ship was less than five thousand meters from the *Gallipoli* when she exploded—close enough for the blast wave to hit with devastating force. The cruiser's shields, already depleted from the extended engagement, buckled under the sudden pressure. The wave of superheated debris hammered into the hull, stripping away armor, collapsing sensor arrays, tearing through external equipment.

*Death's Herald* tumbled, her attitude control systems failing, her shields down, her weapons offline. She was alive, but crippled, unable to maneuver or defend herself.

And two Federation corvettes had been waiting for exactly this moment.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 07:16:22**

### Opportunists

Commander Patricia Hayes, commanding the corvette *Relentless*, watched the tactical display as *Gallipoli* died. The explosion was visible even at seventy kilometers—a brief, brilliant star that outshone Jupiter behind it.

> "Sensors, status on that cruiser—*Death's Herald*."

> "Reading multiple system failures, ma'am. Shields are down. Power signatures are erratic. She's tumbling—I don't think she has attitude control."

Hayes looked at the tactical plot. The cruiser was wounded, defenseless, and separated from the rest of the Ryzak formation by the expanding debris field from *Gallipoli*'s destruction. The other three cruisers were pulling back, regrouping around the *Blood of Conquest*.

*Death's Herald* was alone.

> "Helm, plot intercept course. Weapons, arm all missile tubes and charge plasma lances. *Valiant*, this is *Relentless*—you seeing what I'm seeing?"

The response came from the second corvette, Commander Michael Torres's voice carrying grim satisfaction.

> "Copy, *Relentless*. Crippled cruiser, isolated from formation, shields down. I'm reading the same thing you are."

> "Then let's finish what *Gallipoli* started. Follow my approach vector. We go in fast, hit hard, and break off before the other cruisers can respond."

> "Roger that. *Valiant* is with you."

The two corvettes accelerated hard, their engines burning at maximum thrust, vectoring toward the tumbling Ryzak cruiser. They were small ships, built for speed and precision strikes rather than sustained combat, but against a crippled capital ship with no shields and no maneuvering capability, they were deadly.

*Relentless* opened fire first.

Six plasma lances, fired in rapid sequence, crossed the distance in heartbeats. Without shields to absorb the energy, the superheated plasma carved directly into *Death's Herald*'s hull. Armor vaporized. Internal bulkheads melted. The cruiser's wounded systems sparked and died as the plasma burned through critical infrastructure.

*Valiant* followed three seconds later, her own plasma lances adding to the barrage. More armor failed, more systems died. The cruiser was trying to respond, trying to bring point defense online, but her weapons couldn't track, couldn't target, couldn't engage.

Then the missiles hit.

Sixteen weapons, launched from both corvettes, tracking the helpless cruiser. *Death's Herald*'s point defense was offline, her countermeasures were depleted, and she couldn't maneuver. The missiles impacted in a rippling cascade of explosions, each shaped-charge warhead detonating against bare hull, punching deep into the ship's interior.

The cruiser's spine broke.

The structural framework that held the ship together failed catastrophically, the forward section shearing away from the aft in a spray of debris and venting atmosphere. Secondary explosions rippled through both halves as power conduits severed, as fuel lines ruptured, as magazines cooked off.

*Death's Herald* was dead.

> "Target destroyed," Hayes's weapons officer reported. "Debris field expanding."

> "Acknowledged. Helm, evasive maneuvers. Get us clear before the other cruisers notice we're here."

The two corvettes burned hard, vectoring away from the engagement zone, using the debris from both *Gallipoli* and *Death's Herald* as cover. Behind them, the remaining three Ryzak cruisers were already reorienting, their sensors tracking the Federation ships, but the corvettes were fast and the debris field was dense.

By the time the Ryzak could target them, they were gone.

Aboard *Typhoon*, Captain Reeves watched the tactical display update. *Gallipoli* was destroyed. One Ryzak cruiser was gone. The *Blood of Conquest* was still fighting, though barely.

> "Update the tactical assessment," she said quietly. "What's our current status?"

The tactical officer pulled up the summary.

> "Federation: *Typhoon*, *Vanguard*, *Sentinel*—all operational but shields depleted. *Lord Cardigan* is still harassing the second carrier. Three corvettes operational. Talon squadrons have taken losses but are still combat-effective. We're down to thirty-six fighters from the original forty-eight."

> "Ryzak?"

> "One battleship destroyed, one compromised and under our control, one heavily damaged but still fighting. One carrier crippled, one operational but degraded. Three cruisers operational, one destroyed. They've lost approximately eight destroyers and frigates, plus over a hundred interceptors."

Reeves did the math. The Federation had taken losses, but the Ryzak had taken more. The momentum was still with them, but it was a close thing.

> "How long until *Blood of Conquest* breaks?"

> "She's holding on by sheer stubbornness, ma'am. Another ninety seconds of concentrated fire should do it."

> "Then let's not waste *Gallipoli*'s sacrifice. All batteries, target *Blood of Conquest*. Coordinate with *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*. I want that battleship dead."

The Federation battleships adjusted their firing solutions, their railguns tracking the wounded Ryzak vessel. All three ships fired simultaneously, tungsten-carbide rounds screaming across the void.

This time, the *Blood of Conquest* couldn't hold.

Her compromised armor failed, the penetrators carving through to critical systems. Her reactor spiked, the containment field destabilizing. Emergency systems tried to compensate, tried to contain the cascade, but it was too late.

The *Blood of Conquest* exploded, her reactor detonation tearing the ship apart from the inside out. The blast was smaller than *Gallipoli*'s death—more controlled, the containment field managing to direct some of the energy—but the result was the same. The battleship ceased to exist, replaced by an expanding sphere of debris and radiation.

> "Target destroyed," the weapons officer reported.

Reeves nodded slowly. Two Ryzak battleships dead, one compromised, one carrier crippled, four cruisers down to three. The Ryzak had lost their numerical advantage in capital ships.

But the fight was far from over. They still had overwhelming numbers in smaller vessels, and their remaining carrier was still launching interceptors. The battle had shifted, but it hadn't turned.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Reeves asked.

> "Six hours, fifty-six minutes, ma'am."

Nearly seven hours. They'd been fighting for less than an hour, and they had to hold for seven more.

Reeves looked at the tactical display, at the scattered icons representing Federation forces, at the red mass of Ryzak ships still pressing the attack.

*Gallipoli* had bought them time. Captain Harrison and his crew had held the line, had kept fighting until the ship came apart around them.

Now it was up to the rest of them to make sure that sacrifice meant something.

> "All ships, this is *Typhoon*. We've neutralized their battleship advantage. Now we grind them down. Focus fire on cruisers and screening elements. Keep their interceptors contained. And remember—we don't need to destroy them all. We just need to survive long enough for reinforcements to arrive."

She closed the channel and settled back into her command chair.

Six hours, fifty-six minutes.

They could do this.

They had to.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:52:14**

### Stalemate

The *Crimson Fang*—now under HARBINGER's control—had finished destroying the first carrier. The Ryzak vessel was a drifting hulk, atmosphere venting from dozens of breaches, half its launch bays demolished, fires burning in compartments exposed to vacuum. It was still technically intact, but it would never launch another fighter.

That left one carrier operational. And it was making all the difference.

Captain Reeves watched her tactical display with growing frustration. The fourth Ryzak battleship—*Wrath of Dominion*—had been taking sustained fire from all three Federation battleships for the past six minutes. By all rights, it should have been breaking apart by now, its shields failing, its armor compromised.

Instead, its shields were holding steady. Recovering, even.

> "Explain this to me," Reeves said, her voice tight. "We've got three battleships pouring fire into that target. Why isn't it dying?"

The tactical officer highlighted the power distribution overlay.

> "The second carrier, ma'am. It shifted all shield projection capability to the *Wrath of Dominion* once we destroyed *Blood of Conquest*. With only one battleship to support instead of two, the power transfer is more concentrated. They're feeding it faster than we can drain it."

Reeves pulled up the energy readings. The carrier—*Storm Bringer*—had moved into optimal support position, its shield generators running at maximum output, a steady beam of energy connecting it to the battleship. The *Wrath of Dominion* was still taking damage, but the math had changed. Where before the Federation's concentrated fire could overwhelm shield regeneration, now it could only match it.

And in a battle of attrition, time favored whoever could last longer.

> "What about the compromised battleship? Can HARBINGER redirect *Crimson Fang*'s fire to help us?"

> "Negative, ma'am. The boarding team reports that ship's shields are offline—they took too much damage in the engagement. She's got weapons, but no defensive capability. If we move her closer to engage, the Ryzak will tear her apart."

> "And *Lord Cardigan*?"

> "Still harassing the carrier, but her accuracy is too poor to break through shields. She's buying us time by forcing them to divert attention, but she can't deliver killing blows."

Reeves made the calculation. Three Federation battleships against one Ryzak battleship that was being actively sustained by a carrier. Their railguns could hurt it, but they couldn't kill it. Not quickly enough.

And the Ryzak fleet commander had just realized the same thing.

> "Ma'am, enemy fleet is repositioning," the sensor officer called out. "The three cruisers are... they're vectoring on us. Multiple destroyers forming up with them."

Reeves felt ice in her stomach.

The Ryzak had learned from their mistake with *Gallipoli*. They couldn't break through the Federation's capital ship firepower as long as all three battleships were operational. But if they could eliminate the most dangerous one, force it out of the fight—

The tactical assessment was already updating on her display, threat vectors converging on *Typhoon*'s position.

> "They're targeting us," she said quietly. "Three cruisers, five destroyers. Concentrated fire protocol."

Her XO, Commander James Morrison, moved to her side.

> "Ma'am, we're already at sixty-two percent shields from the sustained engagement. If they focus us the way they focused *Gallipoli*—"

> "I know." Reeves's jaw tightened. "Helm, evasive pattern epsilon. Weapons, split fire—keep pressure on the *Wrath of Dominion* but engage those cruisers as they close. And get me a damage control team standing by. We're about to take a beating."

The Ryzak formation was moving with coordinated precision now. The three cruisers—*Reaper's Edge*, *Blood Drinker*, and *Fang of War*—accelerated hard, splitting to attack from multiple vectors. Behind them, five destroyers matched their course, weapons charging, ready to add their lighter particle beams to the barrage.

They'd learned. They'd adapted. And now they were coming for blood.

---

The first wave of particle beams hit *Typhoon* from three directions simultaneously.

The battleship's shields flared brilliant white, already stressed from an hour of sustained combat. Reeves felt the ship shudder under her feet as the defensive fields struggled to dissipate the concentrated energy.

> "Shields at fifty-four percent," the tactical officer reported. "Multiple impacts, port and starboard quadrants."

> "Return fire. I want those cruisers suppressed."

*Typhoon*'s secondary batteries spoke, railgun rounds and missiles streaking toward the attacking cruisers. One salvo caught *Reaper's Edge* on her forward shields, forcing her to maneuver. Another forced *Blood Drinker* to adjust course. But they weren't breaking off—they were just being more careful, coordinating their approach.

The destroyers opened fire.

Lighter particle beams lanced across the void, adding to the barrage. They weren't as powerful as the cruisers' weapons, but there were five of them, and they were targeting specific sections of *Typhoon*'s shields, trying to create weak points.

> "Shields at forty-seven percent. Forward generators are running hot."

Another wave of fire from the cruisers. Then another. They were firing in sequence now, coordinated, never giving *Typhoon*'s shields time to recover. The pattern was deliberate, methodical, the same tactics they'd used to destroy *Gallipoli*.

Reeves watched her shield integrity dropping: 47%... 43%... 39%...

> "Engineering, reroute all available power to shields. Strip it from weapons if you have to."

> "Already doing it, ma'am. But we're taking damage faster than we can compensate."

*Fang of War* maneuvered into optimal position, its full broadside bearing on *Typhoon*'s weakened forward quarter. Six particle beams lanced out simultaneously, converging on the same stressed section of shield.

The forward shield generator failed.

> "Forward shields down!" the tactical officer shouted. "Rerouting through backup systems—"

A destroyer's particle beam punched through the gap before the backup could initialize. The beam carved into *Typhoon*'s armor, vaporizing plating, penetrating to the first internal bulkhead before the backup shield finally engaged.

> "Hull breach, section seven! Emergency containment in place. Forward sensor array is damaged—we've lost resolution on targets bearing zero-two-zero through zero-four-zero."

The ship shuddered as another concentrated barrage hammered home. The shields were holding, but barely. Reeves could see the power distribution readouts—they were redlining, pulling from every available system to feed the shield generators.

> "Shields at thirty-one percent, ma'am."

Twenty-nine percent.

Twenty-six percent.

> "Captain," Morrison said quietly. "If we stay here, they're going to tear us apart. We need to disengage."

Reeves looked at the tactical display. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* were still pouring fire into the *Wrath of Dominion*, but without *Typhoon* adding her guns, they weren't making progress. The Ryzak battleship's shields were holding, sustained by the carrier's power transfer.

But Morrison was right. If *Typhoon* stayed in the fight, she'd suffer the same fate as *Gallipoli*. And losing a second battleship would shift the balance too far.

> "Helm, break off. Set course for Jovian Shipyards, maximum velocity. Weapons, covering fire as we disengage—I want those cruisers focused on us, not on *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*."

> "Aye, ma'am."

*Typhoon* rotated, her main engines burning hard, accelerating away from the engagement zone. Her weapons continued firing as she withdrew, railguns and missiles keeping the Ryzak cruisers honest, forcing them to maintain defensive posture.

A parting shot from *Reaper's Edge* caught *Typhoon*'s aft shields, the defensive field flickering dangerously.

> "Shields at nineteen percent!"

> "Keep us moving. Engineering, damage assessment—what shape are we in?"

The chief engineer's voice came through, strained.

> "We've got hull breaches in three sections, forward sensor array is barely functional, two secondary batteries are offline, and our shield generators are on the edge of thermal failure. We need to get out of this fight, Captain. If we take one more concentrated barrage, we're done."

Reeves watched the tactical display as *Typhoon* pulled away, the distance to the Ryzak formation increasing. The cruisers were pursuing, but cautiously—they'd learned not to overextend. They were content to let *Typhoon* go, mission accomplished.

They'd forced the most powerful Federation battleship out of the fight.

> "ETA to Jovian Shipyards?"

> "Thirty-four minutes at current velocity, ma'am."

> "Get us there. And signal the yards—tell them we're coming in hot and we need emergency repairs. Priority items: shield generators, forward sensors, hull breaches, weapons systems. In that order."

She turned to Morrison.

> "You have the conn. Get us to the yards safely. I need to coordinate with *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*."

Morrison nodded, moving to the command chair. Reeves pulled up the fleet channel.

> "*Vanguard*, *Sentinel*, this is *Typhoon*. We're withdrawing for emergency repairs. You're the primary capital ships on station. HARBINGER, status of the compromised battleship?"

The AI's distinctive voice came through immediately.

> "Boarding team maintains control of *Crimson Fang*. Weapons are operational but shields are offline. Current position is defensible but vessel cannot maneuver aggressively without risk of destruction."

> "Understood. *Vanguard*, *Sentinel*—continue pressure on the *Wrath of Dominion*. Don't let that carrier sustain it unopposed. Corvettes, continue harassment operations against the screening elements. Talons, maintain fighter superiority and look for opportunities against the carrier."

A pause, then Captain Anderson's voice from *Vanguard*.

> "Acknowledged, *Typhoon*. We'll hold the line. You get those shields back online."

> "Count on it. *Typhoon* out."

Reeves looked at the tactical display one more time. The *Typhoon* was pulling away from the battle, her icon moving toward Jupiter. Behind her, *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* continued their duel with the *Wrath of Dominion*, railguns firing, taking return fire from the Ryzak cruisers and destroyers.

The Federation had lost *Gallipoli*. They'd lost twelve Talons. And now their most powerful battleship was out of action for at least the next hour.

The math was getting worse.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Reeves asked quietly.

> "Six hours, forty-eight minutes, ma'am."

Almost seven hours. And *Typhoon* would be at the yards for at least thirty to forty minutes of that, maybe longer depending on the damage.

Reeves settled into a secondary station, pulling up damage reports, coordinating with the engineering teams. The fight was continuing without them, and every minute *Typhoon* was out of action was a minute *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* had to hold alone.

She looked at the chronometer.

Six hours, forty-eight minutes.

They'd made it through the first hour. Six and a half more to go.

The Ryzak had demonstrated they could adapt, could learn, could force Federation capital ships out of the fight through concentrated fire. They'd leveled the playing field.

Now it was a question of whether the Federation could hold long enough for Third North Fleet to arrive.

And whether there would be anything left to save when they did.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:42:31**

### Attrition

The Federation Talons were dying.

Not in dramatic explosions or sudden catastrophic failures. They were dying slowly, worn down by an enemy that refused to quit. The Ryzak interceptors kept coming, wave after wave, launching from the carrier's remaining functional bays. The Federation pilots were better trained, better equipped, and better coordinated—but they were outnumbered, and in a fight of attrition, numbers eventually won.

Lieutenant Sarah Chen—callsign "Reaper"—rolled her Talon into a hard break, a Ryzak interceptor screaming past her canopy close enough to see the alien pilot inside. Her weapons had been depleted fifteen minutes ago. She was flying on fumes, using her superior maneuverability to stay alive, to draw fire, to keep the enemy off her squadron mates who still had ammunition.

> "Reaper-Three, you're clear. Bandit on your six is splashed."

> "Copy, Lead. I'm winchester. Plasma lances depleted, missiles gone. RTB for resupply."

> "Acknowledged. Jump to Jovian Shipyards, get rearmed, get back here. Clock's ticking."

Reaper-Three broke from the engagement, his Talon's jump drive spooling up. Space twisted around the craft, and it vanished—a two-minute round trip to the shipyards and back, but he'd need at least ten to fifteen minutes on the ground for rearm and refuel before he could return to the fight.

Chen checked her tactical display. Of the original forty-eight Federation Talons that had started the engagement, twenty-seven were still in the battle space. Another eight were at Jovian Shipyards going through frantic resupply operations, crews working at emergency speed to reload weapons and patch damage. Thirteen had been destroyed outright, their pilots either dead or recovered by search and rescue craft.

The rotation system was keeping them alive, barely. Talons could jump out, rearm in the shipyards, and jump back in under two minutes of travel time. But the shipyard crews could only work so fast, and every Talon that jumped out for resupply was one less fighter in the engagement space.

And the Ryzak interceptors kept coming.

> "All Talon elements, this is Reaper Lead. We're rotating through resupply but we can't keep pace. They're launching faster than we can reload. I'm seeing ammunition depletion across multiple squadrons."

The response from *Vanguard*'s tactical coordinator was immediate, and grim.

> "Acknowledged, Reaper Lead. We're reading the same. Stand by."

Chen watched another Talon—Falcon-Four—break away from the furball, engines burning hard as his jump drive engaged. The pilot's voice came through, exhausted.

> "Falcon-Four jumping to yards. Third resupply run. I'll be back in fifteen."

> "Copy, Falcon-Four. Good hunting."

But the math was brutal. Even with the rotation system, even with the shipyard crews working around the clock, the Federation couldn't sustain this tempo. For every Talon that jumped out to rearm, the Ryzak gained local superiority for those critical minutes.

Chen's threat receiver screamed. She yanked the stick hard, rolling into evasive maneuvers, feeling the g-forces compress her into the seat. A Ryzak interceptor flashed past, its weapons tracking but missing by meters.

Her weapons display showed empty. She'd been flying for twelve minutes without ordnance, pure evasion, drawing fire and providing targeting data for her wingmen. It was time to rotate out.

> "Reaper Lead is winchester. Jumping to yards for resupply. Reaper-Two, you have the squadron."

> "Copy, Lead. We'll hold."

Chen selected the jump coordinates, felt the drive engage, and watched space twist around her canopy. The engagement zone vanished, replaced by the structured chaos of Jovian Shipyards, where ground crews were already waving her toward a loading bay.

Two minutes total jump time. Fifteen minutes for resupply and systems check. Then back into the meat grinder.

> "All Talons, this is Station Command. We need help. Reinforcements are inbound."

### The Call

Commander Sarah Chen stood in Galileo Station's operations center, staring at the tactical display. The numbers were stark and getting worse by the minute.

Federation Talons: 27 in engagement space, 8 rotating through resupply, 13 destroyed. Total combat effectiveness down 47% from initial strength.

Ryzak interceptors: Still launching from the carrier, estimates putting active craft at 80+.

The rotation system through Jovian Shipyards was buying time, but it wasn't sustainable. The Federation couldn't maintain fighter superiority against these odds, not with the resupply bottleneck. And if they lost the fighter engagement, the Ryzak interceptors would start hitting *Vanguard*, *Sentinel*, and the corvettes.

They'd held for nearly an hour. They'd bloodied the Ryzak fleet badly. But they were running out of options.

Chen pulled up the communication protocols.

> "HARBINGER, are you monitoring?"

The AI's geometric form materialized on her screen immediately.

> "Affirmative, Commander Chen. I am tracking the fighter engagement degradation. Current resupply rotation rate is insufficient to maintain combat strength."

> "We need reinforcements. What's the status of Earth's Talon squadrons?"

> "All Earth-based squadrons have been on standby since the engagement began. Portugal: twenty-five aircraft. United States: twenty aircraft. Japan: sixteen aircraft. All pilots are in their craft, all systems are hot, and they are prepared for immediate deployment."

Chen took a breath. The Earth pilots had been briefed twelve hours ago, when HARBINGER appeared on every screen and told them aliens were coming. They knew what was at stake. They knew what they'd face.

Now it was time to prove they were ready.

> "Authorization code Chen-Alpha-Seven. Deploy all Earth Talon squadrons immediately. Transmit jump coordinates for engagement zone."

> "Understood, Commander. Transmitting now."

Chen watched the communication status update. Encrypted signals, using quantum-paired channels, transmitted simultaneously to Monte Real Air Base in Portugal, Groom Lake in Nevada, Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, and Hyakuri Air Base in Japan.

The message was simple:

**PRIORITY ALPHA. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. ALL TALON SQUADRONS SCRAMBLE IMMEDIATELY. COORDINATES TRANSMITTED. COMBAT DEPLOYMENT. ENGAGE ON ARRIVAL.**

On Earth, thousands of kilometers below, pilots were already moving. They'd been sitting in their cockpits for hours, waiting for this moment. Ground crews were pulling chocks. Engines were lighting up.

And in less than five minutes, Earth's defenders would join the fight.

> "HARBINGER, coordinate the deployment. Get them formed up above the atmosphere and jump them directly into the engagement zone."

> "Acknowledged, Commander. Coordinating now."

Chen looked at the tactical display one more time. Twenty-seven Federation Talons in the engagement space, trying to hold against eighty Ryzak interceptors.

Help was coming.

It just had to arrive in time.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:34:52**

### Scramble

At Monte Real Air Base, Lieutenant Miguel Freitas was already in his Talon's cockpit, had been for hours, monitoring the tactical feed from the battle above. He'd watched *Gallipoli* die. He'd watched *Typhoon* withdraw. He'd watched the Federation Talons fight and die against impossible odds.

Twelve hours ago, HARBINGER had appeared on every screen in the briefing room and told them the truth. Aliens were real. Aliens were coming. And Earth was going to war.

Miguel had known HARBINGER for three years—or known *of* the AI, at least. When the Talons first arrived in Portugal, HARBINGER had been the voice explaining the technology, walking pilots through the capabilities, teaching them how to fight in vacuum. The AI's presence had been constant but distant, a teacher more than a companion.

Now that voice was about to send them into combat.

The alert tone cut through his headset.

**PRIORITY ALPHA. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. ALL TALON SQUADRONS SCRAMBLE IMMEDIATELY.**

Miguel's hands moved on pure training, muscle memory from hundreds of sorties taking over. Throttles forward, systems check, weapons armed—

> "All Portuguese Talons, this is Tower. You are cleared for immediate takeoff. Vector three-five-zero, climb to orbital insertion altitude. Execute."

The Talon's engines screamed to life, the fusion drive spooling up with a sound that Miguel felt in his chest. Around him, twenty-four other Talons were doing the same, the entire squadron lighting up simultaneously.

> "Strike Package Delta, this is Delta Lead. Form on me. We're going up."

Miguel released the brake and the Talon leaped forward, acceleration pressing him back into his seat. The runway blurred beneath him, then fell away as the aircraft clawed for altitude. Beside him, Captain Teresa Ramos's Talon matched his climb.

The sky above was clear, brilliant blue fading to the black of space as they climbed. Miguel's altimeter spun upward—ten thousand meters, twenty thousand, thirty thousand. The air was thinning, but the fusion drive pushed harder.

Fifty thousand meters. The curvature of Earth was visible now, Portugal's coastline spreading out beneath him. Seventy thousand meters. One hundred thousand.

The sky was black. Stars were visible, steady and unblinking. His aircraft's systems transitioned smoothly from atmospheric flight to vacuum operations.

Miguel Freitas was in space.

And he wasn't alone.

---

At Groom Lake, Major Ellie Morse led the American squadron into the climb, twenty Talons rising from the Nevada desert. The transition to vacuum was smooth, practiced, exactly as briefed.

> "All US Talons, this is Viper Lead. Form up at rally point alpha. We've got friends joining us."

At Kadena, eight operational Talons screamed off the runway, climbing hard toward orbit. Major Morse checked her tactical display, watching as icons began appearing—Portuguese craft climbing out of Europe, Japanese fighters rising from Hyakuri.

At Hyakuri Air Base, Major Tanaka Utsuho—"Okuu"—pushed her throttle to maximum, feeling the Talon respond. Beside her, fifteen other Japanese pilots climbed in formation.

> "JASDF Talons, this is Raven Lead. Vector two-eight-five, climb to one hundred twenty thousand meters. Link up with allied forces."

Okuu watched her altimeter climb. She'd been briefed twelve hours ago about what was coming. She'd had time to process it, to accept it, to prepare herself mentally for what she was about to face.

Her hands were steady on the controls.

---

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:28:11**

### Formation

At one hundred and twenty thousand meters above Earth's surface, sixty-one Talons from four nations formed up in a loose sphere. Most of the pilots had never met, had never flown together, but they'd all received the same briefing twelve hours ago. They knew what they were facing. They knew the stakes.

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas's tactical display showed them all—blue icons scattered across his screen, each one representing a pilot from a different nation. Strangers, yes, but united by a common purpose.

They were Earth's defenders.

HARBINGER's voice cut through the tactical net, deep and familiar.

> "All Earth Talon squadrons, this is HARBINGER. Jump coordinates are locked into your navigation systems. You will emerge directly into the engagement zone, approximately fifteen thousand meters from the primary furball."

Miguel had heard this voice countless times during training. But hearing it now, knowing what waited at the other end of that jump, was different.

> "Ryzak interceptors will be immediately hostile. Engage on sight. Maintain formation discipline. Federation forces are with you. I am with you. And Earth is watching."

Miguel checked his weapons display. Full loadout. Plasma lances charged. Missiles armed. Shields at one hundred percent.

> "Warp drives active."

Everything became a luminous tunnel as the Talons jumped forward bending space ahead of them. And then, they were there.

Jupiter filled Miguel's canopy, massive and brilliant. The engagement zone was ahead, marked by weapons fire, by explosions, by scattered debris.

And everywhere, red icons. Ryzak interceptors, dozens of them, turning to face the new arrivals.

HARBINGER's voice cut through the tactical net, calm and precise.

> "All Earth Talons, you have arrived. Weapons free. Engage at will."

Miguel armed his weapons, selected his first target, and pushed his throttle forward.

Twenty-five Portuguese Talons followed him.

Twenty American Talons dove from above, Major Morse's voice cutting through the net: "Viper Squadron, engage!"

Sixteen Japanese Talons rolled into attack formation, Major Tanaka's crisp acknowledgment: "Hell Ravens, moving to intercept!"

Sixty-one fresh Talons, full weapons loadout, pilots ready for their first kills.

The Ryzak were about to learn that Earth had arrived.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:25:13**

### First Blood

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas's targeting system locked on a Ryzak interceptor at eight thousand meters, the alien craft's angular frame highlighted in red on his HUD. The fighter was turning toward him, weapons charging, but Miguel was faster.

He squeezed the trigger.

The plasma lance shot out, a brilliant line of superheated matter crossing the distance in a heartbeat. The Ryzak's shields flared white, then failed. The lance punched through the cockpit section, coring the craft. It tumbled away, already breaking apart.

Miguel's first kill. An alien fighter, in space, defending Earth.

He didn't have time to process it.

> "Delta-Two, splash one. Engaging new target."

Captain Ramos's voice came through, tight with focus.

> "Delta Lead, confirm kill. Good shooting. Delta Flight, stay tight, don't get separated."

The Portuguese squadron drove into the Ryzak formation like a spear, plasma lances firing, missiles launching. Around them, the American and Japanese squadrons were doing the same, each element hitting from a different vector.

The effect was immediate and devastating.

The Ryzak interceptors had been pressing hard against the depleted Federation Talons, maintaining numerical superiority through sheer volume. But they'd been fighting for nearly ninety minutes, their pilots were fatigued, their weapons were depleted, and their formation was loose.

Sixty-one fresh fighters, coordinated and aggressive, hit them like a sledgehammer.

Major Ellie Morse rolled her Talon onto a target, fired, watched it die, and immediately acquired another. Her wingman splashed two more in quick succession. The American squadron was moving through the Ryzak formation like sharks through a school of fish.

> "Viper-Three, splash three and four. These guys are slow—they can't track us."

> "Stay focused," Morse replied. "Don't get cocky. There are still a lot of them."

She was right. Despite the sudden reversal, despite the losses, the Ryzak had numbers. For every interceptor the Earth pilots destroyed, there seemed to be two more behind it. The carrier was still launching, still feeding craft into the engagement zone.

But the momentum had shifted.

Major Tanaka Utsuho—"Okuu"—led her Japanese squadron in a slashing attack through the Ryzak right flank. Her element destroyed five interceptors in thirty seconds, plasma lances and missiles working in perfect coordination.

> "Hell Ravens, reform on me. Don't chase—stay disciplined. Let them come to us."

The doctrine was working. The Earth pilots had trained for this, drilled the tactics until they were instinctive. Stay in formation, support your wingman, engage decisively and break off before the enemy could respond.

The Ryzak were trying to adapt, trying to counter, but they were fighting on fumes against fresh pilots in superior aircraft.

---

Aboard Galileo Station, Commander Sarah Chen watched the tactical display with grim satisfaction. The arrival of Earth's squadrons had changed everything. The Ryzak interceptor advantage was evaporating, their numbers dropping rapidly as the coordinated Earth attack tore through them.

> "Federation Talon elements, this is Station Command. Earth forces are engaged and holding. All Federation squadrons are cleared to rotate through Jovian Shipyards for emergency resupply. Execute immediately."

The response was immediate. The exhausted Federation pilots, many flying on empty weapons bays and damaged systems, began breaking off from the engagement. Their jump drives spooled up, and they vanished in ripples of twisted space, heading for the shipyards.

For the first time in nearly two hours, they had breathing room.

Chen pulled up the fleet status summary, her expression darkening as she reviewed the numbers.

Federation Talons: 27 operational but depleted, rotating to resupply. 13 destroyed.

Earth Talons: 61 engaged, fresh weapons and systems.

Total allied fighters: 88 operational.

Ryzak interceptors: Estimated 70-80 still in engagement zone, with carrier continuing to launch.

The math was still brutal. Even with Earth's reinforcements, they were outnumbered. The Ryzak had more fighters in the battle space, and their carrier could keep launching for hours yet.

This wasn't a victory. It was a reprieve.

> "HARBINGER, analysis. Can we hold with current force composition?"

The AI's geometric form appeared on her screen, pulsing thoughtfully.

> "Current engagement projections show Earth forces maintaining local superiority for approximately forty-seven minutes, accounting for ammunition expenditure and pilot fatigue. However, Ryzak carrier launch tempo has not decreased. They are replacing losses faster than we can inflict them."

> "So we're still losing the attrition battle."

> "Correct. The arrival of Earth forces has stabilized the situation temporarily, but the fundamental mathematics remain unfavorable. We have approximately eighty-eight fighters against seventy-plus interceptors, with the Ryzak able to launch an additional fifty to sixty craft before their carrier's magazine is depleted."

Chen looked at the tactical display, watching the swirling dogfight play out. Blue icons and red icons, merging and separating, each exchange leaving fewer fighters in the battle space.

> "What about the capital ship engagement?"

> "*Vanguard* and *Sentinel* continue to engage the *Wrath of Dominion*, but the carrier's shield projection is sustaining the battleship. *Typhoon* is at Jovian Shipyards undergoing emergency repairs, ETA to return to combat is forty-three minutes. *Lord Cardigan* continues harassment of the carrier but is taking accumulated damage."

> "How much longer can *Cardigan* hold?"

HARBINGER's geometric form flickered.

> "Unknown. Her shields are compromised, her jury-rigged systems are failing. The Ryzak screening elements are beginning to focus fire on her. Estimate she will be forced to disengage within the next ten to fifteen minutes."

Chen's jaw tightened. They'd held for two hours. They had nearly five more to go before Third North Fleet arrived. And the Ryzak were grinding them down, ship by ship, fighter by fighter.

> "Keep me updated. And HARBINGER—coordinate with the Earth squadrons. Make sure they understand they're not invincible. Those pilots are green, and they're going to make mistakes."

> "Acknowledged, Commander."

Chen turned back to the tactical display, watching the battle unfold. The Earth pilots were performing better than anyone had expected, better than they had any right to given that this was their first real combat.

But "better than expected" wasn't the same as "good enough to win."

And the clock kept ticking.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:19:37**

### Accumulation

The battleship *Lord Cardigan* had been fighting for two hours straight with jury-rigged civilian shields and gunners using manual targeting. She'd harassed the Ryzak carrier, forced it to maneuver, destroyed two destroyers through sheer luck and volume of fire.

But her luck was running out.

Captain William Shaw stood on his bridge, watching the shield integrity readouts drop with each passing minute. The civilian generators they'd installed at Jovian Shipyards were never designed for sustained combat. The emergency bypass connections were failing one by one, the jury-rigged power conduits overheating.

> "Shields at thirty-eight percent," the tactical officer reported. "Port generator is offline. Starboard generator is running at one hundred forty percent rated capacity and climbing."

> "Reroute power from non-essential systems," Shaw ordered. "Life support, secondary lighting, crew quarters—strip it all. Feed those shields."

> "Aye, sir."

The *Cardigan* shuddered as another volley of particle beams struck her shields. The Ryzak screening elements—two cruisers and four destroyers—had finally decided she was enough of an annoyance to warrant concentrated attention. They were coordinating their fire now, methodically wearing down her defenses.

> "Shields at thirty-one percent. Starboard generator temperature is redlining. Engineering reports imminent failure."

Shaw looked at the tactical display. The carrier—*Storm Bringer*—was maintaining its shield projection to the *Wrath of Dominion*, keeping the Ryzak battleship alive despite concentrated fire from *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*. *Lord Cardigan* had been harassing it for nearly two hours, forcing it to divide its attention, preventing it from focusing entirely on shield projection.

But they'd done all they could do. The math was clear.

> "Helm, set course for Jovian Shipyards. Maximum velocity. Weapons, continuous fire until we're out of range. Let's make them remember us."

> "Aye, sir."

The *Lord Cardigan* began to turn, her massive bulk rotating ponderously, her engines preparing to burn hard. Her railgun batteries continued firing even as she maneuvered, rounds screaming toward the carrier and its escorts with wild, unpredictable trajectories.

One shot actually connected with a destroyer's shields, the impact stressing the defensive field. Another missed by three hundred meters. A third somehow clipped the carrier's aft quarter, the round skipping off shields at an angle.

Pure luck, every single one. But it was making the Ryzak nervous.

> "Engineering to bridge. Starboard shield generator just failed. Complete thermal burnout. We're down to backup systems only."

> "Acknowledged. How long until we can jump?"

> "Drive is spooling up now. Thirty seconds."

The Ryzak cruisers intensified their fire, sensing the Federation battleship was trying to escape. Particle beams lanced across the void, hammering into *Cardigan*'s failing shields. The backup generators were struggling, flickering, barely holding.

> "Shields at eighteen percent. Backup generators are overloading."

Shaw watched the jump drive status: twenty seconds. Fifteen. Ten.

A concentrated barrage from both cruisers struck simultaneously. The shields flared, held for half a second, then collapsed entirely.

The follow-up shots punched through bare armor.

Plating buckled. Bulkheads ruptured. The hits weren't deep penetrations—*Cardigan* was too tough for that—but they were carving channels through her outer hull, destroying weapons mounts, sensor arrays, point defense turrets.

> "Hull breaches, sections nine, twelve, and fifteen. Emergency containment holding. We've lost two secondary batteries."

The jump drive indicator turned green.

> "Helm, execute jump. Now."

Space twisted around the *Lord Cardigan*, and she vanished, leaving the engagement zone in a ripple of distorted space-time. The Ryzak cruisers continued firing for three seconds at empty space before their targeting systems recognized the Federation battleship was gone.

Shaw allowed himself a moment to breathe.

> "Damage report."

> "Hull breaches in three sections, shields completely offline, starboard generator is slag, port generator is barely functional. Two secondary batteries destroyed, point defense coverage reduced by forty percent. We're alive, sir, but we're not combat effective."

> "Get us to the shipyards. Emergency docking procedures. Tell them we need shield generators, armor patches, and weapons replacements. And tell them we'll be back."

Shaw looked at his communications officer.

> "Open a channel. All frequencies. Let's give everyone something to remember us by."

> "Channel open, sir."

Shaw nodded to the systems operator, who'd been waiting for this order since they'd started the engagement. The operator's hands moved across the console, pulling up a file that had been loaded into the ship's systems before they'd even left Jovian Shipyards.

The opening notes of Iron Maiden's *The Trooper* began to play over the comm links—loud, defiant, unmistakably human.

Shaw's voice cut through the music, carrying across every tactical channel in the engagement zone.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is *Lord Cardigan*. We're withdrawing for repairs, but we're not done yet. Keep fighting. Keep shooting. And remember—we're defending Earth. They picked the wrong planet."

The music swelled, Eddie's distinctive guitar riff cutting through the chaos of battle.

*You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too*
*You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through*

Throughout the engagement zone, pilots heard it. Federation crews heard it. Earth's fresh squadrons heard it. Even the Ryzak, monitoring human communications, heard the strange, aggressive sounds of an alien music form.

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas heard it as he rolled onto another target, and despite the fear, despite the exhaustion, despite everything, he smiled.

Major Ellie Morse heard it and pushed her throttle forward harder, diving into the furball with renewed aggression.

Major Tanaka heard it and keyed her squadron channel.

> "Hell Ravens, you heard the battleship. They bought us time. Let's make it count."

Aboard *Vanguard*, Captain Anderson heard it and allowed himself a brief smile before returning his attention to the *Wrath of Dominion*.

And aboard Galileo Station, Commander Sarah Chen heard it and felt something that might have been hope, or might have been defiance, or might have been the simple human refusal to quit even when the odds were impossible.

*The Trooper* continued to play as *Lord Cardigan* warped toward the shipyards, her hull scarred, her shields down, but her guns silent only because she'd run out of targets in range.

The Ryzak had forced another Federation battleship out of the fight.

But that battleship had left on her own terms, with music playing and her guns still hot.

And somehow, that mattered.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:12:44**

### Charge of the Light Brigade

The *Lord Cardigan* materialized at Jovian Shipyards in a shimmer of twisted space, her scarred hull trailing frozen atmosphere from three separate breaches. Emergency crews were already moving toward her docking position before the ship had finished decelerating.

Captain Shaw stood on his bridge, watching the damage control reports scroll across his displays. Hull breaches in three sections. Shields completely offline. Two secondary batteries destroyed. Point defense coverage reduced by forty percent.

She was a wreck. But her engines still worked. Her jump drive still functioned. And her main railgun batteries, despite everything, were still operational.

Shaw keyed the ship-wide comm.

> "All hands, this is the Captain. Disembark. That's an order. Engineering, damage control, gunnery crews—everyone. You have five minutes to get to the airlocks. Move."

There was a moment of stunned silence across the ship.

> "Sir?" his XO, Commander Patricia Hayes, said quietly. "What are you—"

> "You heard the order, Commander. Get the crew off this ship. Now."

Hayes looked at him, her expression shifting from confusion to understanding to something that might have been horror.

> "Is he going to...?" the tactical officer muttered to the sensor operator.

> "Yeah," the sensor operator replied, already moving toward the exit. "He's going to."

Hayes didn't move. She stood there, staring at Shaw.

> "Sir, you can't—"

> "Commander, I'm not asking. I'm ordering. Get the crew to safety. They've earned it."

> "And you?"

Shaw turned to face her, his expression calm.

> "*Lord Cardigan* has one more trip in her. And I'm going to make sure she gets there."

Hayes opened her mouth to argue, then closed it. She'd served with Shaw for three years. She knew that tone. Knew that look. There was no arguing with him now.

> "It's been an honor, sir."

> "The honor's been mine, Commander. Now get off my ship. You have four minutes."

Hayes saluted, then turned and ran for the exit. Around the bridge, the remaining crew were already moving, heading for the airlocks. Shaw watched them go, then turned back to his displays.

The evacuation took three minutes and forty-two seconds. Shaw watched the personnel indicators drop to zero on every section of the ship except the bridge. The airlocks sealed. The docking clamps released. Emergency crews at the shipyards were already pulling back, sensing something was about to happen.

Shaw moved to the helm station and sat down, his hands settling on the controls. The interface was simple enough—he'd piloted smaller craft before, back when he was a lieutenant. A battleship wasn't that different. Just bigger. Much bigger.

He pulled up the navigation computer, plotting a course back to the engagement zone. The system calculated the jump coordinates automatically, displaying the destination on his tactical overlay.

Then he adjusted the terminus point.

The navigation computer immediately flashed a warning in angry red text:

**WARNING: WARP TERMINUS INSIDE SOLID OBJECT**
**COLLISION PROBABILITY: 100%**
**RECOMMEND COURSE ADJUSTMENT**

Shaw stared at the warning for a moment, then reached out and overrode it. The system protested with another warning, then another. He overrode them all, manually confirming each safety interlock, each emergency protocol.

The terminus point locked in. The crippled Ryzak carrier—the one that *Crimson Fang* had torn apart earlier in the engagement. The vessel was still technically intact, still venting atmosphere, still burning in compartments exposed to vacuum. Its shields were down. Its crew was evacuating.

And *Lord Cardigan* was going to jump directly into its midsection.

Shaw pulled up the communications console, setting it to broadcast on all Federation channels.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is Captain William Shaw, *Lord Cardigan*. To the crew who served with me—you made this ship proud. To everyone still fighting out there—hold the line. Earth is counting on you."

He paused, his hands steady on the controls.

> "*Lord Cardigan*, out."

He closed the channel and activated the jump drive. The battleship's massive engines began to spool up, power building in the drive coils, space-time beginning to bend around the ship's hull.

Shaw thought of his crew, safely evacuated at Jovian Shipyards. Of Commander Hayes, who'd served with distinction and deserved to survive this war. Of the Earth he'd never see again, but would defend with his last breath.

The warp drive reached full charge, and the *Lord Cardigan* launched forward in a tunnel of compressed space.

---

The carrier *Worldbreaker* hung in the void, crippled and burning. Half its launch bays were torn open, venting atmosphere in crystalline plumes that caught Jupiter's distant light. Fires burned in compartments exposed to vacuum, fed by oxygen still leaking from ruptured life support conduits. The vessel's spine was compromised, structural members visible through gaps in the hull plating where *Crimson Fang*'s weapons had carved deep wounds.

Ryzak crew were evacuating in a steady stream, escape pods launching every few seconds, small bright points of thrust vectoring away from the dying ship. The carrier's reactor was still stable, but the damage was catastrophic. The vessel would never fight again.

Then space twisted.

It began as a ripple, a distortion in the fabric of reality itself, appearing sixty meters inside the carrier's hull. The warp tunnel was opening, space-time folding to accommodate the incoming vessel, and the terminus point was locked precisely where Captain Shaw had set it—in the carrier's midsection, deep within the superstructure, surrounded by bulkheads and compartments and the skeletal framework that held the massive ship together.

The *Lord Cardigan* emerged.

Time seemed to slow, each microsecond stretching into subjective eternity as fifteen hundred meters of Federation battleship materialized inside Ryzak architecture.

The bow appeared first, the reinforced prow designed to deflect micrometeorites and debris at high velocity. It emerged moving at relativistic speeds—the residual velocity imparted by the warp transition, a fraction of lightspeed translated into conventional space. The prow materialized occupying the same physical coordinates as a Ryzak bulkhead, and physics made its preference clear.

The bulkhead ceased to exist.

Not shattered, not torn apart—simply *ceased*. The molecular bonds holding the Ryzak alloy together encountered an object attempting to occupy the same space, and the fundamental forces of reality rejected that impossibility. The matter didn't have time to compress, didn't have time to shear. It just stopped being in that location, its atoms scattered at the quantum level, disrupted beyond any possibility of cohesion.

The battleship continued forward, momentum carrying it deeper into the carrier's hull.

More bulkheads vanished. Compartments full of equipment, ammunition, supplies—all of it encountering the impossible intrusion of a capital ship materializing inside them. Structural members that could support thousands of tons of force simply disappeared where the *Lord Cardigan*'s mass overlapped them. The carrier's internal architecture was being erased, frame by frame, as the battleship carved through it.

But the *Lord Cardigan* was dying too.

Her bow crumpled, the reinforced plating designed to withstand weapons fire encountering forces it was never built to handle. The forward sections compressed like an accordion, each meter of penetration costing the battleship her own structure. Armor plating buckled inward, then failed. The forward torpedo tubes collapsed, their magazines detonating in sympathetic explosions that added to the catastrophic damage.

Deeper still, the battleship plowed into the carrier's engineering section.

The Ryzak power conduits, thick cables carrying energy from the reactor to the ship's systems, were sheared through. Raw power arced across the severed connections, brilliant white-hot plasma leaping between contacts before the automatic cutoffs could engage. Fuel lines ruptured, spraying volatile chemicals that ignited instantly in the presence of the electrical discharge.

The carrier's spine—the central structural member running the length of the vessel—encountered the *Lord Cardigan*'s forward superstructure. Both were designed to be the strongest parts of their respective ships. Both were built to withstand forces that would tear lesser structures apart.

Neither survived the impact.

The spine shattered, stress fractures racing along its length in both directions, branching like lightning through metal. The carrier's structural integrity failed catastrophically, the framework that distributed force across the hull giving way in sections. The forward third of the ship began to separate, the connection points failing one by one, bulkheads tearing free, compartments venting.

But the *Lord Cardigan* was breaking too.

Her forward sections were gone, crushed and scattered. The bridge where Captain Shaw sat—where he had sat—was compressed into a space too small to contain it, every system failing simultaneously, every surface collapsing inward. The middle sections were crumpling, each frame buckling as it encountered resistance, the battleship's own momentum working against her structural members.

And then the reactor containment failed.

The *Lord Cardigan*'s fusion core, already damaged from the earlier engagement, already stressed by the carrier's weapons fire, now faced forces it could never have been designed to withstand. The magnetic containment field, the invisible cage that held a miniature star in check, flickered and died.

The fusion reaction, no longer constrained, expanded.

It happened in nanoseconds, but in the stretched subjective time of the catastrophe, each stage was distinct. The plasma—hydrogen heated to millions of degrees, compressed to the point where nuclei fused—expanded outward in a sphere. It encountered the reactor housing first, the reinforced walls designed to contain exactly this scenario. They held for a fraction of a second, directing the expanding plasma down the emergency venting channels.

But this wasn't a controlled shutdown. This was total containment failure.

The plasma burned through the reactor housing in microseconds. It carved through the surrounding compartments, through crew quarters that were empty, through weapons magazines that weren't. The first magazine detonation added conventional explosives to the expanding fireball. Then another. Then a dozen more, the *Lord Cardigan*'s remaining ammunition cooking off in a cascading sequence of secondary explosions.

The battleship came apart from the inside.

The expanding plasma found the carrier's reactor next. The Ryzak containment system, still functional despite the catastrophic damage, detected the incoming energy wave and attempted an emergency shutdown. Magnetic fields intensified, trying to maintain cohesion, trying to prevent exactly what was about to happen.

It wasn't enough.

The wave of superheated plasma from the *Lord Cardigan*'s reactor struck the carrier's containment field and overwhelmed it. The Ryzak reactor's magnetic cage collapsed, and a second fusion reaction lost containment. Two miniature stars, now unconstrained, merged into a single expanding sphere of plasma hotter than the surface of Earth's sun.

The combined detonation propagated outward in all directions simultaneously.

Through the carrier's remaining structure, finding fuel reserves and ammunition stores, each new source of combustible material adding to the growing fireball. Through the *Lord Cardigan*'s aft sections, the battleship's stern separating from what remained of the forward hull, tumbling away even as it vaporized. Through the debris field already surrounding both ships, smaller fragments flash-heating to incandescence before sublimating into plasma themselves.

The light was brilliant beyond description. Every wavelength from radio to gamma, the full electromagnetic spectrum released in a single pulse that traveled outward at the speed of light. The visible component—the light that human and Ryzak eyes could detect—was a brief, terrible white that outshone Jupiter itself for three full seconds.

From Galileo Station, seventy kilometers away, every external sensor automatically filtered the brightness, preventing the blast from saturating the detectors. The flash appeared as a new star in the tactical display, so bright it cast shadows in the operations center despite the distance.

From the engagement zone, every pilot saw it. Federation Talons, Earth squadrons, Ryzak interceptors—all of them registered the detonation on their sensors, the massive energy spike that temporarily overwhelmed their detection systems.

And then, as quickly as it had appeared, the light began to fade.

The expanding plasma sphere cooled as it grew, radiating energy into the void, its temperature dropping from millions of degrees to thousands to hundreds. The brilliant white faded to orange, then red, then infrared invisible to the naked eye.

When the sensors cleared and could resolve the space where the carrier had been, there was nothing.

No carrier. No battleship. No debris larger than a few meters across. Just an expanding sphere of vaporized metal and superheated gas, spreading out into the black, cooling and dissipating, joining the countless other particles drifting through the void.

The *Lord Cardigan* and the Ryzak carrier *Worldbreaker* had ceased to exist, their matter scattered across thousands of cubic kilometers, their structures reduced to their component atoms.

And in the silence that followed, as sensors recalibrated and tactical displays updated, as the brilliant afterimage faded from human and alien retinas alike, one fact became clear to everyone who had witnessed it:

Captain William Shaw had taken his broken battleship and ended the war's largest remaining Ryzak carrier in the single most destructive close-range engagement in the battle's history.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 06:07:19**

### The Wrath Endures

Aboard *Vanguard*, Captain Anderson watched the tactical display update as the brilliant flash faded from his sensors. The carrier icon blinked out, replaced by a debris field marker. One Ryzak carrier eliminated. Only one remained operational.

> "*Lord Cardigan* confirmed destroyed," the sensor operator reported, his voice subdued. "Both vessels completely vaporized. No survivors."

> "Tactical assessment," Anderson said quietly. "How does this change the engagement?"

The tactical officer pulled up the revised fleet composition.

> "The remaining Ryzak carrier—*Storm Bringer*—can no longer maintain shield projection to their battleship and full launch tempo simultaneously. They'll have to choose between sustaining the *Wrath of Dominion* or continuing to deploy interceptors."

> "And which are they choosing?"

> "Neither yet, sir. They're... reconfiguring. Pulling back screening elements, tightening formation."

Anderson studied the display. The Ryzak fleet was adjusting, the remaining carrier repositioning, the battleship *Wrath of Dominion* maintaining its defensive stance while cruisers and destroyers formed a tighter screen.

They were adapting again. Learning.

> "How long until *Typhoon* returns?"

> "Thirty-eight minutes, sir. Jovian Shipyards reports they're rushing the repairs, but she won't be at full capability."

Thirty-eight minutes. Anderson looked at his own ship's status. *Vanguard* had been in continuous combat for over two hours. Shields were at forty-seven percent and slowly regenerating. Three secondary batteries were offline. Point defense coverage was degraded. The destroyer *Sentinel* was in similar condition, her jury-rigged Kryllian drive performing adequately but her overall combat effectiveness reduced.

Two Federation battleships against one Ryzak battleship being sustained by a carrier.

The math should have favored the Federation. Should have.

But the stalemate had held for nearly forty minutes now, both sides pouring fire into each other, neither able to achieve a decisive advantage. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* couldn't break through the shield projection fast enough, and the *Wrath of Dominion* couldn't maneuver aggressively enough to force either Federation ship out of the fight.

> "Sir, new contact," the sensor operator called out. "Multiple launches from *Storm Bringer*. Not interceptors—these are bigger. Reading them as bomber-class craft."

Anderson felt ice settle in his stomach.

> "How many?"

> "Twelve. They're forming up behind the screening elements. Torpedo profiles, heavy munitions loadout."

Bombers. Capital ship killers. The Ryzak had been holding them in reserve, and now they were deploying them.

> "Time to intercept range?"

> "Four minutes at current velocity. They're staying behind their screen, using the cruisers and destroyers for cover."

Anderson pulled up the tactical plot. The bombers were moving in formation, protected by the Ryzak screening elements. The Federation Talons were engaged with interceptors, still outnumbered despite the arrival of Earth's squadrons. The corvettes were scattered across the engagement zone, harassing targets of opportunity.

Nobody was in position to stop twelve bombers from reaching *Vanguard*.

> "Helm, evasive pattern gamma. Point defense, prioritize anti-bomber protocols. *Sentinel*, this is *Vanguard*—we have bombers inbound, vector two-seven-three. Recommend evasive maneuvers."

The response from *Sentinel*'s captain came immediately.

> "Acknowledged, *Vanguard*. We see them. Maneuvering now."

Both Federation ships began to move, thrusters firing, changing course to complicate the bombers' attack runs. But battleships were large, slow targets. Evasive maneuvers helped, but they wouldn't be enough against dedicated bomber craft.

> "Alert all Talon squadrons," Anderson ordered. "We need fighter cover on *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* immediately."

---

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas heard the call and checked his tactical display. His element was engaged with Ryzak interceptors thirty thousand meters from the Federation battleships, trading shots in the ongoing furball that had consumed the engagement zone.

> "Delta Flight, this is Delta Lead. *Vanguard* is calling for bomber intercept. Break off current engagement, vector one-one-five."

> "Delta-Two, copy. Breaking now."

> "Delta-Three, with you."

> "Delta-Four, on your six."

The four Portuguese Talons disengaged from the interceptor fight, their engines burning hard as they accelerated toward the new threat. Miguel's HUD showed the bomber formation—twelve heavy craft, each one carrying torpedo loads that could cripple a battleship.

He also saw the Ryzak screening elements between his flight and the bombers. Three destroyers, positioned specifically to prevent exactly what he was attempting.

> "Delta Flight, we've got a screen. Destroyers at bearing zero-nine-zero. We'll need to punch through."

> "Delta-Two, I'm reading point defense active. They're expecting us."

Miguel's tactical computer updated with intercept solutions. The destroyers were well-positioned, their point defense fields overlapping, creating a zone of fire that would be costly to penetrate. But the bombers were continuing their approach to *Vanguard*, and if they reached launch range unopposed, the battleship would take catastrophic damage.

> "Delta Flight, we go through. Arm missiles, full spread on the lead destroyer. Fire on my mark."

Four Talons, sixteen missiles total. Against a destroyer with active point defense and supporting escorts.

Miguel armed his weapons and pushed his throttle forward.

---

Aboard *Vanguard*, Captain Anderson watched the tactical display as multiple Talon elements broke from the interceptor engagement and vectored toward the bomber formation. Portuguese, American, Japanese—all of them responding to the call, trying to reach the bombers before they could launch.

But the Ryzak screen was holding. The destroyers' point defense was active, creating kill zones that the Talons would have to fly through. Some would make it. Some wouldn't.

> "Bombers at two minutes to launch range," the tactical officer reported.

> "All batteries, engage the screening elements. I want those destroyers suppressed."

*Vanguard*'s railguns spoke, tungsten-carbide rounds screaming toward the Ryzak destroyers. The destroyers' shields flared as they absorbed the impacts, but they held. The cruisers behind them were adding their own fire support, particle beams lancing toward *Vanguard*, forcing the battleship to split her attention between offensive and defensive operations.

The bombers continued their approach, now ninety seconds from launch range.

On the tactical display, Anderson watched the Portuguese element—Delta Flight—launch their missiles at the lead destroyer. Sixteen weapons, spreading as they tracked toward the target. The destroyer's point defense engaged, railgun turrets tracking, firing. The first missile died, then the second, then four more.

But ten made it through.

The destroyer's shields buckled under the concentrated strike, the defensive field failing in two sections. The follow-up missiles punched through bare hull, shaped-charge warheads detonating against armor. The destroyer rolled, venting atmosphere, its formation position compromised.

The Portuguese Talons dove through the gap, their plasma lances firing as they engaged the bomber formation directly.

Three bombers died in the first exchange, their heavy frames unable to maneuver like interceptors, unable to evade the concentrated fire from four Talons. A fourth bomber's shields failed, its wing sections shearing away under sustained fire.

But there were still eight bombers, and they were in launch range.

> "Bombers launching torpedoes!" the sensor operator called out. "Multiple weapons, inbound on our position!"

The tactical display lit up with red icons—capital ship torpedoes, each one carrying warheads designed to punch through battleship armor. Twenty-four weapons total, spread across two salvos targeting both *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*.

> "Point defense, engage! All batteries, maximum rate!"

*Vanguard*'s point defense turrets came alive, railguns tracking the incoming torpedoes, firing in rapid sequence. The first torpedo died at eight thousand meters, its warhead detonating prematurely. The second and third followed. But there were too many, coming from too many vectors.

Four torpedoes penetrated the point defense screen.

The first struck *Vanguard*'s port shields, the defensive field flaring brilliantly as it struggled to dissipate the shaped-charge detonation. The shield held, but barely. The second torpedo hit the same section three seconds later, and the shields failed.

The third torpedo punched through bare armor.

The shaped-charge warhead detonated against *Vanguard*'s hull, the plasma jet carving through armor plating, through the first bulkhead, through the second. The penetration reached a secondary magazine, and the stored munitions cooked off in a cascade of explosions.

The battleship shuddered violently, alarms shrieking across every station.

> "Direct hit, port side, sections twelve through fifteen!" damage control reported. "Multiple compartment breaches, secondary explosions, fires in three sections. We've lost two secondary batteries and the aft port shield generator."

The fourth torpedo hit moments later, striking the already-damaged section, driving deeper into the battleship's interior. More explosions, more breaches, more systems failing.

Anderson gripped his command chair as the ship bucked beneath him.

> "Damage report!"

> "Port side is compromised, sir. We've got structural damage to the main frame, shields are failing in multiple quadrants. Engineering reports—" the officer's voice cut off as another alarm sounded. "Sir, we've got containment warnings in the reactor section. The damage is affecting coolant flow."

> "Can they stabilize it?"

> "They're trying, sir, but if we take another hit in that area—"

Anderson looked at the tactical display. *Sentinel* had taken torpedo hits as well, her shields failing, her hull showing damage indicators across multiple sections. Both Federation battleships were hurt, their combat effectiveness degrading rapidly.

And the Ryzak bombers were still out there, repositioning for another attack run.

> "Sir, recommend we withdraw," his XO said quietly. "If we stay in the fight, we risk losing both ships."

Anderson stared at the display. The *Wrath of Dominion* was still there, still sustained by the carrier's shield projection, still fighting. If *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* withdrew, the Ryzak battleship would be free to target the corvettes, or worse, to begin bombardment operations against the Federation's remaining assets.

But if they stayed, they'd die.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Anderson asked.

> "Four hours, twelve minutes, sir."

Four hours. They'd held for nearly three already. Four more seemed impossible.

Another proximity alarm shrieked. The bombers were lining up for a second attack run.

> "Helm, set course for Jovian Shipyards. Maximum velocity. *Sentinel*, this is *Vanguard*—we're withdrawing for emergency repairs. Recommend you do the same."

There was a pause, then *Sentinel*'s captain responded.

> "Acknowledged, *Vanguard*. We're with you."

Both battleships began to turn, their engines burning hard, accelerating away from the engagement zone. The Ryzak bombers pursued for several thousand meters, but without their screening elements' support, they were vulnerable to the Talon squadrons. Two more bombers died to concentrated fire before the survivors broke off and returned to the carrier.

Anderson watched the tactical display as *Vanguard* pulled away from the battle, her damaged hull trailing frozen atmosphere, her shields flickering.

They'd held the line for three hours. They'd bloodied the Ryzak fleet, eliminated two carriers, destroyed multiple battleships and cruisers.

But now the Federation's last two operational battleships were withdrawing, damaged and unable to continue the fight.

The Ryzak *Wrath of Dominion*, despite everything, despite the concentrated fire, despite the losses around it, remained operational.

And four hours still remained until Third North Fleet could arrive.

The tactical situation had just become critical.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:12:07**

### Desperate Measures

Commander Sarah Chen stood in Galileo Station's operations center, staring at the tactical display with mounting dread. The icon representing *Vanguard* was moving away from the engagement zone, trailing damage indicators. *Sentinel* followed close behind. Both battleships were withdrawing, their hulls compromised, their combat effectiveness reduced to near zero.

Which left the engagement zone defended by Talons, three corvettes, and eighteen automated defense platforms that were already running low on ammunition.

Against one Ryzak battleship, one carrier, and their remaining screening elements.

> "Fleet status update," Chen said quietly.

Lieutenant Marcus Webb pulled up the summary, his expression grim.

> "All Federation battleships withdrawn or destroyed. *Typhoon* is still at Jovian Shipyards undergoing emergency repairs, ETA thirty-two minutes. *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* are en route to the yards, both critically damaged. Talon squadrons are still engaged but running low on ammunition. We're rotating them through resupply, but the tempo is unsustainable."

Chen looked at the Ryzak formation on the display. The *Wrath of Dominion* sat at the center, shields still being sustained by the carrier *Storm Bringer*. Cruisers and destroyers formed a protective screen. The remaining bombers had returned to the carrier, presumably rearming for another strike.

> "What's their tactical posture?"

> "Defensive, ma'am. They're holding position, not advancing. It's like they're... waiting for something."

Chen's jaw tightened. Waiting. The Ryzak had achieved local superiority, forced the Federation capital ships out of the engagement zone, and now they were consolidating their position.

For what?

Her communications console chimed. Priority channel from HARBINGER.

> "Commander Chen, I must advise you of a developing situation."

The AI's geometric form appeared on her screen, pulsing an urgent blue-white.

> "Go ahead, HARBINGER."

> "The Ryzak fleet is repositioning. Vector analysis suggests they are preparing for system departure. Projected course suggests they intend to proceed to Earth."

Chen felt ice settle in her chest.

> "They're going for the planet. They know we can't stop them."

> "Correct. With Federation capital ship assets neutralized, the Ryzak possess overwhelming firepower advantage against terrestrial targets. Talon squadrons cannot prevent orbital bombardment operations."

Chen pulled up the navigation overlay, watching as HARBINGER's projection traced the Ryzak fleet's likely course. From the beacon to Earth. A straight line. No obstacles. No defenses capable of stopping them.

Chen looked at the reinforcement timer.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:11:33**

Four hours until Third North Fleet arrived. The Ryzak could reach Earth in less than that. They could establish orbital positions, begin bombardment operations, and Earth's defenses—conventional military forces with no experience fighting capital ships—would be helpless.

Billions of people. Defenseless.

> "Ma'am," Webb called out, his voice tight. "The Ryzak formation is moving. They're... they're accelerating. Vector confirms—they're heading for Earth."

Chen watched the red icons on the display begin to move, pulling away from the beacon, orienting toward the inner system. The battleship, the carrier, all the screening elements. Moving together, accelerating steadily.

> "Warp signatures building," the sensor operator added. "They're preparing to jump. Ma'am, they're leaving. They're going to Earth."

The operations center fell silent. Every officer, every technician, every person in the room understood what that meant. The Ryzak had won the engagement at the beacon. Now they were moving to the real objective.

Earth.

> "Ma'am," Webb said quietly. "The ships are accelerating for warp. It's over, ma'am."

Chen stared at the display, at the red icons picking up speed, at the warp drive signatures building in intensity. Her fists clenched at her sides.

> "Nothing's over while we're breathing!"

The operations center fell silent, every head turning toward her. Chen straightened, her mind racing through options, through contingencies, through every possible asset they had left.

And then she remembered.

The briefing from three months ago. The theoretical weapon system. The one that had never been tested, never been activated, never been used because the calculations suggested it might work but nobody was sure. The one that engineering had classified as "experimental and potentially catastrophic."

FLYCATCHER.

> "HARBINGER," Chen said, her voice steady despite the adrenaline flooding her system. "What's the status of the FLYCATCHER system?"

There was a pause. The AI's geometric form flickered, processing.

> "FLYCATCHER is installed and theoretically operational. However, Commander, I must remind you that the system has never been tested under combat conditions. The theoretical models suggest significant risk—"

> "I don't need the safety briefing. I need to know if it will work."

Another pause.

> "Theoretical probability of successful activation: seventy-two percent. Probability of catastrophic failure resulting in station destruction: eighteen percent. Probability of partial success with unknown consequences: ten percent."

> "And if it works, what's the effective range?"

> "Projected disruption field radius: two hundred fifty kilometers, centered on Galileo Station. All vessels within this sphere will be unable to form stable warp tunnels. Duration is dependent on power reserves—estimated operational time is four hours before primary systems begin to fail."

Chen looked at the tactical display. The Ryzak fleet was still accelerating, warp signatures building. In less than two minutes, they'd jump. And once they were in warp, nothing could stop them from reaching Earth.

Four hours until reinforcements arrived.

Four hours of FLYCATCHER operational time.

The math was brutal. But it was the only option left.

> "All stations, this is Commander Chen. Prepare for emergency protocol FLYCATCHER activation. Engineering, bring the gravity generators to full power and stand by for field inversion. All personnel, secure loose equipment and prepare for zero-gravity operations."

Webb looked at her, his eyes wide.

> "Ma'am, are you sure? If this fails—"

> "If this fails, we're in the same situation we're in now. If it works, we buy four hours. That's all we need."

She turned to the communications console.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is Galileo Station. We are activating emergency countermeasures in sixty seconds. All vessels within two hundred fifty kilometers of the station will be unable to form warp tunnels. This includes friendly forces. Acknowledge and prepare for extended combat operations."

The responses came back immediately from the Talon squadrons, from the corvettes, from *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* as they pulled away from the engagement zone. Confusion, questions, but ultimately acknowledgment.

Chen pulled up the FLYCATCHER control interface. The system was housed deep in Galileo Station's core, wrapped around the primary gravity generator. The concept was elegant in its simplicity: take the generator that created artificial gravity throughout the station and invert its field projection, creating a sphere of chaotic gravitational noise that would prevent warp tunnel formation.

The side effect was that gravity aboard the station would drop to zero. Everything not secured would become a projectile. Every system would need to operate in microgravity. And if the power draw was miscalculated, if the field became unstable, the generator could tear itself apart and take the station with it.

But if it worked, the Ryzak fleet would be trapped. Unable to warp. Unable to reach Earth.

Forced to fight for four more hours until Third North Fleet arrived.

> "Engineering reports ready, ma'am," Webb said. "Gravity generators at full power. Field inversion protocols loaded. Awaiting your command."

Chen took a breath. On the tactical display, the Ryzak warp signatures were reaching critical levels. Thirty seconds until they jumped.

She thought of Earth, of billions of people who had no idea what was happening, who would wake up tomorrow to either freedom or subjugation depending on what happened in the next few minutes.

> "HARBINGER, transmit activation code. All hands, brace for zero gravity."

The AI's geometric form pulsed once.

> "Activation code transmitted. FLYCATCHER engaging in three... two... one..."

Deep in Galileo Station's core, the gravity generator's field inverted.

The change was instantaneous. Every object not secured to a surface suddenly had no weight. Coffee cups floated away from desks. Data pads drifted upward. Personnel grabbed handholds, magnetic boots activating automatically, securing them to the deck plates.

But the real effect was external.

A sphere of distorted space-time expanded outward from the station at the speed of light, two hundred fifty kilometers in radius, a bubble of chaotic gravitational noise. Not a physical barrier—ships could still maneuver through it, still fire weapons, still operate normally.

But warp drives required stable space-time to function. They needed to fold reality in precise, calculable ways. The FLYCATCHER field made that impossible. Every point in space within the sphere was experiencing random gravitational fluctuations, making it impossible to form the stable tunnel needed for faster-than-light travel.

Aboard the *Wrath of Dominion*, alarms shrieked.

The battleship's warp drive, fully charged and ready to engage, suddenly detected catastrophic instability in the surrounding space-time. Safety protocols engaged automatically, dumping power, shutting down the drive before it could tear the ship apart.

Across the Ryzak fleet, the same thing happened. Every ship, from the carrier *Storm Bringer* to the smallest destroyer, experienced simultaneous warp drive failure. Not damage—the drives were fine. But the space around them had become impossible to navigate at faster-than-light speeds.

They were trapped.

And so was everyone else within two hundred fifty kilometers of Galileo Station.

The Federation Talons, still engaged with Ryzak interceptors, suddenly found their emergency jump-out protocols unavailable. The corvettes couldn't retreat to safe distance. Even *Vanguard* and *Sentinel*, limping toward Jovian Shipyards, discovered their warp drives were non-functional as long as they remained within the disruption sphere.

Everyone was stuck.

No jumping out. No jumping in. No warp travel of any kind.

Just conventional drives, weapons, and shields.

For the next four hours.

Commander Chen floated in Galileo Station's operations center, her magnetic boots keeping her anchored to the deck, and watched the tactical display. The Ryzak fleet had stopped accelerating toward Earth. Their warp signatures had collapsed. They were trapped in the engagement zone.

Together with every Federation and Earth asset in the system.

> "FLYCATCHER is active," HARBINGER reported. "Disruption field stable at two hundred fifty kilometers radius. Ryzak fleet vector change detected—they are reorienting toward the station."

Of course they were. Chen had just trapped them, prevented them from reaching Earth. They couldn't ignore that.

> "Power reserves?" Chen asked.

> "Current draw is within acceptable parameters. Estimated operational time: four hours, seven minutes. Sufficient to maintain field until Third North Fleet arrival."

Four hours, seven minutes.

Chen looked at the red icons on the display, now turning, now vectoring back toward Galileo Station. The Ryzak weren't retreating. They were coming to destroy the source of the disruption field.

They were coming for the station.

> "All hands," Chen said into the station-wide comm, her voice calm despite floating in zero gravity with a Ryzak battle fleet bearing down on them. "This is Commander Chen. We have activated FLYCATCHER. The Ryzak cannot reach Earth. They cannot escape. And in four hours, Third North Fleet will arrive with overwhelming force."

She paused, looking around the operations center at her crew floating at their stations, working in microgravity, preparing for what came next.

> "Our job is to survive until they get here. All defensive systems to full combat readiness. All personnel to battle stations. We're going to show the Ryzak what it means to corner a Federation station."

She closed the channel and turned to Webb.

> "Time to reinforcements?"

> "Four hours, six minutes, ma'am."

Chen looked at the tactical display one more time. The Ryzak fleet was accelerating toward them now, no longer trying to reach Earth, focused entirely on destroying Galileo Station and the disruption field it was projecting.

One station. Minimal defenses. Against a Ryzak battle fleet.

For four hours.

> "HARBINGER," Chen said quietly. "Alert all Talon squadrons. Tell them to form up around the station. We're about to become the most important target in the solar system."

> "Acknowledged, Commander. Transmitting now."

The geometric form pulsed, and across the engagement zone, every Federation and Earth pilot received the same message:

Defend Galileo Station. At all costs. For four hours.

And if the station fell, Earth fell with it.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:06:18**

### Window of Opportunity

Lieutenant Miguel Freitas felt the change immediately. His Talon's warp drive, which had been on standby for emergency jump-out procedures, suddenly went dark. Warning indicators flashed across his HUD, then resolved into a simple message:

**WARP DRIVE INOPERABLE - GRAVITATIONAL INSTABILITY DETECTED**

> "Delta Flight, this is Delta Lead. Anyone else getting warp drive failures?"

> "Delta-Two, confirmed. Drive's offline. What the hell just happened?"

Then HARBINGER's voice cut through the tactical net, calm and precise despite what it was announcing.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is HARBINGER. Galileo Station has activated FLYCATCHER protocol. Warp disruption field is now active in a two hundred fifty kilometer radius centered on the station. All vessels within this sphere cannot engage warp drives. Repeat: warp travel is impossible within the disruption field."

Miguel checked his tactical display. The field was marked now, a blue sphere centered on Galileo Station. His Talon was well inside it, as were all the other fighters, the corvettes, and the entire Ryzak fleet.

Trapped. All of them.

> "Delta Flight, does this affect our sublight drives?"

> "Delta-Two checking... negative, Lead. Fusion drives are nominal. We can still maneuver at sublight."

Miguel's mind raced through the implications. No warp capability meant no jumping to Jovian Shipyards for emergency resupply. The bigger capital ships were stuck inside the field for the duration.

But fighters were different.

Talons were fast at sublight speeds. The disruption field was 250 kilometers in radius. At maximum thrust, a Talon could clear that distance in—Miguel ran the quick calculation—eight, maybe nine minutes. Exit the field, warp drive would come back online, jump to the yards, rearm, jump back, re-enter the field at sublight.

It would take longer than the previous instant jump-out protocol. Much longer. But it was still viable.

> "Delta Flight, listen up. We can still rotate for resupply. Eight minutes to clear the field at maximum burn, then standard jump protocols to the yards. Thirty to thirty-five minutes total per cycle. It's not ideal, but it works."

> "Delta-Two, understood. That's... actually not bad. We can maintain combat operations."

> "Delta-Three confirms. We're not trapped like the capital ships."

Miguel keyed the general tactical net.

> "All Talon squadrons, this is Delta Lead. Fighter resupply is still viable through conventional transit. Eight minutes to clear FLYCATCHER field, then standard jump to Jovian Shipyards. We can keep fighting."

There was a brief pause, then HARBINGER's voice came through, carrying what might have been approval.

> "Delta Lead, correct assessment. Talon craft possess sufficient sublight velocity to exit disruption field and maintain resupply rotation. All squadrons are cleared for conventional transit protocols."

Then Major Ellie Morse's voice cut through the net, sharp and focused.

> "All squadrons, this is Viper Lead. The Ryzak just lost warp capability same as us. Check your sensors—they're showing confusion in their formation. Their bombers are exposed, no screening elements in position. This is our window. Hit them now while they're sorting themselves out."

Miguel pulled up his tactical display and felt a surge of understanding. The Ryzak fleet had been accelerating for warp jump, their formation optimized for transit rather than combat. The bombers—eight surviving craft loaded with capital ship torpedoes—were positioned behind the screening elements but ahead of the main battle line.

And now the Ryzak were dealing with sudden, unexpected warp drive failure across their entire fleet. Alarms would be shrieking on every ship. Crews would be checking systems, running diagnostics, trying to understand what had just happened.

They were distracted. Vulnerable.

And the bombers were exposed.

> "Delta Flight, this is Delta Lead. Viper's right. We take those bombers now. They're the biggest threat to the station. Arm all weapons, maximum thrust, engage on my mark."

> "Delta-Two, ready."

> "Delta-Three, with you."

> "Delta-Four, weapons hot."

Across the engagement zone, every Talon squadron received the same realization. Portuguese, American, Japanese—all of them seeing the same opportunity, all of them vectoring toward the exposed bomber formation.

Sixty-one Earth Talons, plus the twenty-seven Federation fighters that had just finished resupply rotation. Eighty-eight fighters total, converging on eight bombers.

The math was suddenly very favorable.

---

Aboard the Ryzak bomber *Deathbringer*, pilot Kresh'mar was still trying to understand the warp drive failure when his threat receiver shrieked a warning.

Multiple contacts. Small, fast, closing from multiple vectors. His tactical display lit up with targeting locks—dozens of them, all focused on his bomber group.

The Federation fighters. All of them. Coming in coordinated attack.

> "Bomber group, break formation! Evasive maneuvers! Request immediate escort support!"

But the escort destroyers were still reorienting, still processing their own warp drive failures. The carrier's interceptors were scattered across the engagement zone, not positioned to protect the bombers. The cruisers were focused on the battleship's defensive screen.

The bombers were alone.

Kresh'mar threw his craft into a hard turn, his secondary eyelids flickering as g-forces compressed his body. Bombers weren't built for this kind of maneuvering—they were heavy, designed for straight attack runs against capital ships, not dogfighting with interceptors.

His threat receiver was solid red now. Missile locks. Energy weapon locks. The Federation fighters were firing.

---

Miguel's targeting computer locked onto the lead bomber, the craft's heavy frame filling his HUD. At eight thousand meters, he squeezed the trigger.

The plasma lance shot out, crossing the distance in less than a second. The bomber tried to evade, rolling hard, but it was too slow, too heavy. The lance caught it on the port engine section, burning through shields weakened by previous combat, carving into the drive assembly.

The bomber's engine exploded, the craft tumbling as thrust vectored wildly from the remaining engine. Miguel didn't wait to confirm the kill. His wingman was already firing on the same target, the second plasma lance punching through what remained of the bomber's shields and coring the cockpit section.

The bomber broke apart, trailing debris and frozen atmosphere.

> "Delta Lead, splash one bomber. Engaging second target."

Around him, the sky was full of tracers and plasma fire as eighty-eight Talons tore into eight bombers. The Ryzak pilots were trying to evade, trying to maneuver, trying to survive, but they were heavy craft being swarmed by faster, more agile fighters.

It was a massacre.

Major Morse rolled her Talon onto a bomber trying to dive away from the furball, lined up the shot, and fired. Her plasma lance punched through the bomber's aft shields, the superheated matter carving through the weapons bay. The stored torpedoes detonated sympathetically, the bomber disappearing in a brilliant flash.

> "Viper-One, splash two. Hell Ravens, I count three more bombers still active. Let's clean this up."

Major Tanaka—"Okuu"—led her Japanese squadron in a coordinated strike on a bomber that had managed to gain some separation from the pack. Sixteen Talons, firing in sequence, overwhelming the bomber's point defense through sheer volume of fire. The bomber lasted three seconds before its shields failed and multiple plasma lances found critical systems.

> "Hell Raven Lead, that's four down. Five. Six."

The seventh bomber died to concentrated missile fire from a mixed element of Portuguese and American Talons, shaped-charge warheads detonating against its hull in rapid succession.

The eighth and final bomber, its pilot desperate, tried to run. Full thrust toward the edge of the engagement zone, trying to gain distance, trying to survive. But there were too many fighters, too many angles of attack. Delta Flight caught it from above, Viper Squadron from the side, Hell Ravens from below.

The bomber died in a crossfire of plasma lances, its hull coming apart in sections, escape pods jettisoning in all directions as the crew abandoned ship.

> "All bombers destroyed," HARBINGER reported over the tactical net, its voice carrying a note of satisfaction. "Ryzak heavy strike capability neutralized. Galileo Station threat level reduced significantly."

Miguel checked his tactical display. Where eight bomber icons had been thirty seconds ago, there was now just debris. The Ryzak fleet was still there—battleship, carrier, cruisers, destroyers—but their ability to deliver decisive strikes against the station had been eliminated.

> "All Talon squadrons, this is Station Command," Commander Chen's voice came through, steady despite the zero-gravity environment she was operating in. "Excellent work. Regroup and establish defensive perimeter around Galileo Station. The Ryzak will be coming for us now. Make them pay for every meter."

Miguel vectored his Talon toward the station, his weapons depleted but his craft still functional. Around him, the other fighters were doing the same, forming up into a defensive sphere around Galileo Station.

Eighty-eight fighters, spread across a 250-kilometer radius, protecting one station.

Against one Ryzak battleship, one carrier, and all their remaining escorts.

For four hours.

But now, at least, the Ryzak couldn't threaten the station with massed torpedo strikes. They'd have to come in close, fight through the fighter screen, expose themselves to concentrated fire.

And the Talons would make them bleed for every attempt.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 04:01:47**

### The Long Siege

Three hours and seventeen minutes.

That's how long Galileo Station had been under siege.

Commander Sarah Chen floated at her station in the operations center, magnetic boots keeping her anchored to the deck in the zero-gravity environment. The displays around her showed damage indicators spreading across the station's exterior, shield strength fluctuating, power distribution diagrams glowing amber and red.

The *Wrath of Dominion* had been methodically hammering the station for over three hours, maintaining standoff range where the battleship's particle beams could reach but the station's limited defensive armament couldn't effectively respond. The Ryzak cruisers and destroyers formed a protective screen, engaging any Talons that got too close, forcing the fighters to dance at the edge of effective range.

It was a siege. Slow, grinding, inexorable.

And the station was losing.

> "Commander, another hit on section seven," Lieutenant Webb reported, his voice carrying the strain of hours in zero gravity. "Shields absorbed it, but we're down to sixty-two percent capacity. Engineering is requesting additional power."

Chen pulled up the power distribution overlay. Every system on the station was already running hot, pushed beyond normal operational parameters. The gravity generator that had been inverted to create the FLYCATCHER field was drawing massive amounts of power. Life support, shields, weapons, sensors—all competing for limited reactor output.

> "Reroute from non-essential systems. Environmental controls in the habitation sections, reduce to minimum. Strip power from anywhere that won't kill us immediately."

> "Already done, ma'am. We're pulling from every available source. Engineering reports the powerplants are running at one hundred twenty-five percent of rated capacity."

One hundred twenty-five percent. Chen had worked in engineering before her command track. She knew what that meant. Reactor cores running at temperatures they weren't designed to sustain. Cooling systems struggling to keep up. Power conduits stressed beyond their specifications.

If they maintained this output much longer, systems would start failing. Not from enemy fire—from simple thermal overload.

> "How long can we sustain one-twenty-five?"

Webb consulted his displays, conferring quietly with the engineering station.

> "Engineering estimates... ninety minutes before we start seeing cascading failures. Maybe two hours if we're lucky. They're already seeing stress fractures in the primary coolant loops."

Chen looked at the chronometer.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 00:44:18**

Forty-four minutes until Third North Fleet arrived. Ninety minutes until the station's powerplants started failing.

The math worked. Barely.

Another impact shuddered through the station, the particle beam from the *Wrath of Dominion* striking the shields. The defensive field flared brilliant white on the external cameras, dissipating the energy, but Chen could see the power draw spike on her displays.

> "Shields at fifty-eight percent," Webb reported. "That last hit stressed the forward generators. We're compensating with backup systems."

> "Talon status?"

> "Sixty-one operational. We've lost twenty-seven over the past three hours. Most are rotating through resupply at Jovian Shipyards, but the cycle time means we've only got about forty fighters in the engagement zone at any given moment."

Sixty-one operational. Chen remembered when Earth's squadrons had arrived—fresh, eager, untested. Eighty-eight Talons total. Now they were down to sixty-one, and that number kept dropping.

Every fifteen or twenty minutes, another icon would blink out on the tactical display. A Ryzak interceptor would get a lucky shot. A destroyer's point defense would track just fast enough. A pilot would make a mistake, push too hard, misjudge a vector.

The Talons were bleeding. Slowly, steadily, inexorably.

> "Ma'am, we've got another Talon down," the sensor operator called out. "Viper-Seven took concentrated fire from two destroyers. Pilot ejected, search and rescue corvette is moving to recover."

Chen watched the icon disappear from the tactical display. Viper-Seven. She didn't know the pilot's name, didn't know if they were American, Portuguese, Japanese. Didn't matter. They'd been defending the station, and now they were drifting in an escape pod, waiting for pickup.

If the station fell before Third North Fleet arrived, those rescue operations would become meaningless. The Ryzak would hunt down the escape pods at their leisure.

> "Time to reinforcements?" Chen asked, though she'd checked the chronometer less than two minutes ago.

> "Forty-two minutes, ma'am."

Forty-two minutes. Two thousand five hundred twenty seconds. She could count them if she wanted. Count down to salvation or destruction.

Another particle beam struck the shields. Then another. The *Wrath of Dominion* was maintaining a steady tempo of fire, not rushing, not pressing hard. Just methodically wearing down the station's defenses.

The battleship knew the math as well as Chen did. They had time. All they needed to do was keep shooting, keep the pressure on, and eventually the station's shields would fail.

Then the hull. Then the reactor. Then everyone aboard.

> "Commander, HARBINGER is requesting communication," Webb said.

Chen pulled up the AI's interface. The geometric form appeared on her screen, pulsing a steady blue that might have been concern.

> "Commander Chen, I must advise you of a developing situation."

> "More good news?"

> "Shield integrity is declining at current rate of Ryzak fire. Projections indicate shield failure in approximately fifty-three minutes. This is within acceptable margins for Third North Fleet arrival, but there is minimal buffer for unexpected complications."

Chen studied the numbers. Fifty-three minutes until shield failure. Forty-four minutes until Third North Fleet arrived.

Nine minutes of margin. Not much, but enough. If the Ryzak didn't increase their fire rate. If the shields degraded at a constant pace. If nothing else went wrong.

Too many ifs.

> "What happens if they press harder? Concentrate fire?"

> "Shield failure timeline would accelerate. Current Ryzak fire tempo appears calibrated to methodical degradation rather than rapid assault. However, if they recognize our temporal constraints and increase aggression, margin for error disappears entirely."

Chen looked at the tactical display. The *Wrath of Dominion* was maintaining steady fire, not rushing, not pressing. The Ryzak fleet commander was playing it safe, letting time do the work.

But if they realized how close it was, if they understood the Federation reinforcements were less than an hour away...

> "Options to extend shield duration?"

> "We can increase power to shields, but this will accelerate reactor stress. Engineering estimates complete powerplant failure would occur in approximately ninety-eight minutes under increased load. Alternatively, we can maintain current power distribution and accept shield failure at fifty-three minutes. The optimal scenario requires precise timing—maintaining current configuration until Third North Fleet arrival provides highest probability of station survival."

So the math was tight, but viable. They just needed the Ryzak to keep doing exactly what they were doing for forty-four more minutes.

And they needed nothing to go wrong.

Chen thought of the billions of people on the planet below, who had no idea this battle was happening, who would wake up tomorrow to either freedom or subjugation depending on decisions made in the next few minutes.

She thought of the Talons out there, sixty-one fighters and their pilots, bleeding slowly to buy these final minutes.

> "We maintain current configuration," Chen said, her voice steady. "Keep FLYCATCHER at full power. Keep the shields up as long as we can. We just need to last long enough."

HARBINGER's geometric form pulsed acknowledgment.

> "Understood, Commander. Maintaining current configuration."

Another impact. Shields at fifty-four percent. Then fifty-one. The *Wrath of Dominion* was picking up its rate of fire, sensing weakness, pressing harder.

Chen pulled up the fleet-wide channel.

> "All Talon squadrons, this is Station Command. We're forty minutes from Third North Fleet arrival. The Ryzak know we're running out of time, and they're pressing hard. I need every fighter you have, every weapon you can bring to bear. Make them work for every shot. Make them pay for every second."

She paused, floating in zero gravity, watching the tactical display show sixty-one blue icons scattered across the engagement zone, dancing with Ryzak interceptors, harassing destroyers, trying desperately to draw fire away from the station.

> "We've held for three hours. We can hold for forty more minutes. Earth is counting on us. Don't let them down."

She closed the channel and turned back to the displays. Shield strength dropping. Power systems strained to the breaking point. The countdown timer ticking steadily toward reinforcement arrival.

Forty minutes.

They just had to survive forty more minutes.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 00:39:47**

### The Cavalry

Twenty-three minutes later, the situation had deteriorated further.

Galileo Station's shields were at thirty-seven percent and dropping. The *Wrath of Dominion* had maintained its methodical bombardment, never rushing, never pressing hard enough to trigger a desperate response. Just steady, relentless fire that wore down the defensive fields one particle beam at a time.

Commander Chen floated at her station, watching the shield integrity display with grim focus. Every hit took another percentage point. Sometimes two. The math was holding, but barely.

> "Shields at thirty-six percent," Webb reported. "Estimated failure in twenty-eight minutes."

Chen looked at the chronometer.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 00:16:52**

Sixteen minutes until Third North Fleet arrived. Twenty-eight minutes until shield failure. The buffer had grown from nine minutes to twelve. They were going to make it.

Unless something changed.

Then the sensor operator's voice cut through the operations center, sharp and urgent.

> "Commander! Unscheduled inbound activation! The beacon is powering up!"

Chen's head snapped toward the sensor station. The cynosural beacon near Jupiter, the same one the Ryzak had used to jump into the system hours ago, was showing a massive power surge.

Someone was opening a bridge.

> "Ryzak escalation?" Chen demanded, her mind racing through possibilities. Reinforcements? A second wave? Had the Ryzak called for backup?

> "Unknown, ma'am. Inbound encryption key is..."

The communications console chimed with an incoming priority signal. Webb's hands moved across the interface, opening the channel.

> "Galileo Station, this is Admiral Trager aboard *In Amber Clad*, Third North Fleet."

The voice came through clear and strong despite the distance, carrying authority and what might have been satisfaction.

> "Reporting for combat. We're five minutes out from the bridge, and our Xenari friends already have it spooled up for us. We'll be coming through the moment we land on-grid. Hold on, we're coming."

Chen felt something that might have been relief, or might have been disbelief, wash over her. Five minutes. Not sixteen. Five.

They'd shaved eleven minutes off their arrival time.

> "Admiral Trager, this is Commander Chen. Galileo Station reads you loud and clear. Be advised, we have FLYCATCHER active—warp disruption field, two hundred fifty kilometer radius centered on this station. The beacon is inside the field. You'll be jumping directly into the disruption zone."

> "Understood, Station. So we're all stuck together once we arrive. Good. Makes it easier to sort out who's friendly. Tactical update: we're coming in with full combat deployment. Nineteen warships, full ammunition loadout, crews rested and ready. What's your situation?"

Chen pulled up the tactical summary, the display showing the battered state of Galileo Station, the sixty-one remaining Talons scattered across the engagement zone, the Ryzak fleet still hammering at the station's shields.

> "Station shields at thirty-six percent and dropping. We've lost twenty-seven Talons over the past three hours. Ryzak fleet composition: one battleship, one carrier, two cruisers, four destroyers, numerous interceptors. The battleship is being sustained by carrier shield projection—they've been working in tandem for the entire engagement."

> "Copy that. We'll deal with the carrier first, cut off their shield support. *In Amber Clad*'s strike wings are already prepped for immediate launch. ETA to your position: five minutes to bridge transit, then... HARBINGER, you reading this?"

The AI's distinctive voice joined the channel.

> "Affirmative, Admiral. Third North Fleet will emerge at the beacon, approximately seventy kilometers from Galileo Station. All fleet elements will be inside FLYCATCHER disruption field upon arrival. No vessel will be able to engage warp drives. Transit time to engagement range at maximum subluminal velocity: approximately eight minutes."

> "So we're fighting at knife-fighting range with no escape routes. Perfect." Trager's voice carried grim satisfaction. "Thirteen minutes total until we're in weapons range. Station, can you hold that long?"

Chen looked at the shield integrity display. Thirty-six percent. Dropping steadily. Twenty-eight minutes until failure at current rate.

Thirteen minutes until Third North Fleet reached engagement range.

The math worked. Easily.

> "We can hold, Admiral. We've held this long. Thirteen more minutes is nothing."

> "That's what I like to hear. All Federation and Earth forces, this is Admiral Trager. Third North Fleet is five minutes from jumping into Sol. When we arrive, the Ryzak are going to find out what happens when you threaten our homeworld. Hold the line just a little longer. Trager out."

The channel closed, but Chen could hear the message being repeated across every tactical frequency, could imagine every pilot in every Talon hearing those words.

Five minutes. Not sixteen. Five.

They'd done it. They'd held long enough.

> "All hands," Chen said into the station-wide comm, her voice carrying across every section of Galileo Station. "Third North Fleet is five minutes out. Repeat, five minutes until reinforcements arrive. They shaved eleven minutes off their transit time. We're almost there."

She paused, looking around the operations center at her crew, who had been working in zero gravity for over three hours, who had maintained their posts while the station shook under enemy fire, who had done everything asked of them and more.

> "We've held this station against a Ryzak battle fleet for three hours and forty minutes. We can hold for thirteen more minutes. Stay sharp. Stay focused. We're going to see this through."

Another particle beam struck the shields. Thirty-five percent. Then thirty-four.

But now, for the first time in hours, Chen wasn't watching the shield display with dread. She was watching the chronometer.

Five minutes until Third North Fleet jumped into the system.

Eight more minutes until they reached engagement range.

Thirteen minutes total.

They'd already survived more than three hours. Thirteen minutes was nothing.

Chen pulled up the tactical display, watching the blue icons representing the Talon squadrons. Sixty-one fighters, still holding formation around the station, still engaging Ryzak interceptors, still buying time with their lives.

Soon, very soon, they'd have backup.

She keyed the channel to all Talon squadrons.

> "All fighters, this is Station Command. Third North Fleet is five minutes from jumping in. Admiral Trager is bringing nineteen warships, full strike wing complement, and enough firepower to crack a planet. You've done your job. You've held the line. Now we just need to keep the Ryzak busy for a few more minutes until the cavalry arrives."

The responses came back immediately. Delta Flight. Viper Squadron. Hell Ravens. Voices tired but determined, pilots who'd been fighting for over three hours and were ready to fight for thirteen more minutes.

> "Delta Lead acknowledges. We're not going anywhere."

> "Viper Squadron copies. We'll keep them honest."

> "Hell Ravens confirm. Thirteen minutes. We can do thirteen minutes."

Chen closed the channel and returned her attention to the tactical display. The Ryzak fleet was still there, still shooting, still trying to destroy the station. They had no idea what was about to happen.

They had no idea that nineteen Federation warships were five minutes away from jumping into the system with orders to end this battle decisively.

The *Wrath of Dominion* fired again. Shields at thirty-three percent.

But now it didn't matter. The clock was running, and it was running in the Federation's favor.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 00:04:37**

### Overwhelming Force

Four minutes and thirty-seven seconds.

Major Tanaka Utsuho—"Okuu"—had been in her Talon's cockpit for over three hours, her flight suit recycling sweat, her hands steady on the controls despite the exhaustion. The Hell Ravens had lost three pilots over the siege. Three empty slots in the formation that would need to be filled by replacements who would never know the people who'd flown in those positions.

Then HARBINGER's voice cut through every channel simultaneously.

> "All forces, bridge activation in ten seconds. Third North Fleet emerging. Clear the beacon approach vector."

Okuu pulled her Talon away from the engagement, vectoring clear of the space around the cynosural beacon. She'd heard about jump bridges in the briefings, read the technical specifications, understood the theory. But she'd never seen one activate. None of the Earth pilots had.

The Ryzak fleet continued firing at Galileo Station, seemingly unaware or unconcerned with the beacon activation. Maybe they thought it was just another supply run. Maybe they didn't care.

Okuu watched her tactical display, counting down.

Five seconds.

Three.

One.

Space *folded*.

There was no other word for it. Reality bent in ways that shouldn't be possible, light twisting into angles that hurt to look at, a distortion that made her instruments scream warnings about gravitational anomalies that couldn't exist. The cynosural bridge opened like someone had torn a hole through the fabric of space itself.

And through it came ships.

**TIME TO REINFORCEMENTS: 00:00:00**

The first vessel emerged from the impossible geometry, resolving from visual distortion into solid matter. *In Amber Clad*, her IFF system identified. A carrier, massive and angular, launch bays already opening, strike wings preparing to deploy. Federation design, human construction, moving with purpose as it cleared the bridge.

Then a battleship. *Final Argument*. Four hundred meters of armored hull bristling with weapons, shields already glowing with power, railguns tracking toward the Ryzak formation.

Another battleship. *Righteous Fury*. Then *Resolute Will*. Then *Hammer of Dawn*.

Four battleships, each one a fortress of weapons and armor, emerging one after another through the bridge that bent physics into impossible shapes.

Behind them came cruisers. *Defiant*. *Unyielding*. *Stalwart*. Seven in total, smaller than the battleships but no less deadly, their weapons already hot, their crews ready.

Then destroyers. Eight fast attack craft spreading out in a protective screen, point defense systems tracking, engines burning.

Nineteen warships materialized from nothing in less than thirty seconds.

Okuu stared through her canopy, watching the ships emerge, watching the bridge collapse back into normal space as the last destroyer cleared the threshold. She'd read about this. She'd seen the specifications. But reading and seeing were different things entirely.

These ships had just traveled light-years in seconds through a tunnel in space-time.

And they were human ships. Built by humans. Crewed by humans.

> "Hell Ravens, did you..." one of her pilots started, then stopped. There weren't words for what they'd just witnessed.

> "I see them," Okuu said quietly. "They're ours. They're humans, like us. And they're here to help."

On the tactical display, the Federation fleet was already moving. No delay, no hesitation. Four battleships accelerating toward the Ryzak formation, their heavy railguns already charging for long-range engagement.

> "All Federation and Earth forces, this is Admiral Trager. Clear firing lanes. We're engaging immediately."

Okuu pulled her Talon back, giving the battleships space. Around her, the Hell Ravens were doing the same, along with every other fighter in the engagement zone. The Talons that had held the line for hours were now pulling back to let the capital ships do their work.

The Federation battleships opened fire.

Four ships, firing in sequence, their heavy railguns sending tungsten-carbide rounds downrange at velocities that made plasma lances look slow. The rounds crossed the seventy kilometers between the fleet and the Ryzak formation in seconds.

The *Wrath of Dominion*'s shields flared as the first salvo struck. The carrier *Storm Bringer* was still projecting shield support, still sustaining the battleship as it had for the entire engagement.

But it wasn't enough.

Not against four Federation battleships firing simultaneously.

The first salvo stressed the shields. The second salvo, arriving three seconds later, stressed them further. The third salvo punched through.

Tungsten-carbide rounds, each one massing several tons, struck the *Wrath of Dominion*'s bare hull at relativistic velocities. Armor plating that had withstood hours of combat simply failed. The rounds penetrated deep into the battleship's structure, carving through bulkheads, through compartments, through vital systems.

One round found the reactor section.

The *Wrath of Dominion* detonated.

Not catastrophically—the reactor had automatic shutdown protocols, and they engaged before total containment failure. But the damage was done. The battleship's spine broke, the structural framework unable to withstand the penetration and subsequent internal explosions. The ship came apart in three large sections, atmosphere venting, systems failing, escape pods jettisoning in all directions.

Eleven seconds. That's how long the *Wrath of Dominion* survived against Third North Fleet's concentrated fire.

Eleven seconds.

Okuu stared at her display, watching the red icon representing the Ryzak battleship blink out, replaced by debris field markers.

The ship that had been hammering Galileo Station for over three hours. The ship that had forced *Vanguard* and *Sentinel* to withdraw. The ship that had killed pilots from every nation.

Gone in eleven seconds.

> "They just... they deleted it," one of her pilots said, voice carrying disbelief.

> "That's what four battleships can do when they're fresh," Okuu replied, watching the Federation fleet continue its work. "That's what we've been waiting for."

On the tactical display, the Federation cruisers were engaging the Ryzak carrier now, particle beams and missiles lancing across the void. The *Storm Bringer*, which had been sustaining the battleship's shields, was now alone, its screening elements scattered.

Two cruisers concentrated fire on the carrier's shield generators. The defensive fields flickered, failed in sections, came back online with reduced capacity. A third cruiser added its weapons to the barrage.

The carrier's shields collapsed entirely.

Missiles struck bare hull, shaped-charge warheads detonating against armor. Particle beams carved through the carrier's superstructure, burning through launch bays, through fuel reserves, through the ship's vital systems.

The *Storm Bringer* tried to maneuver, tried to gain distance, but it was a carrier—large, slow, designed for launching fighters, not for capital ship combat. The Federation cruisers matched its every move, their targeting computers tracking perfectly, their weapons never stopping.

The carrier's reactor went critical.

The explosion was smaller than the *Worldbreaker*'s detonation—the *Lord Cardigan* had ensured that one would be memorable—but it was still brilliant against the black, still visible from Galileo Station seventy kilometers away.

When the light faded, the carrier was gone.

Two minutes and forty-three seconds. That's how long the Ryzak capital ships survived after Third North Fleet's arrival.

The Ryzak cruisers and destroyers were breaking formation now, trying to scatter, trying to escape. But they were inside the FLYCATCHER field. No warp capability. No jumping out. Just conventional drives against a Federation fleet that outnumbered them three to one.

It wasn't a battle anymore. It was a hunt.

Federation destroyers pursued Ryzak destroyers, their superior speed allowing them to close range and engage with overwhelming firepower. Cruisers targeted Ryzak cruisers, particle beams and railgun rounds finding their marks with methodical precision.

The Ryzak interceptors, suddenly without carrier support, without the battleship's screening fire, found themselves facing not just sixty-one exhausted Talons but also fresh Federation strike wings launching from *In Amber Clad*.

The numerical advantage that had sustained the Ryzak for hours evaporated in minutes.

Okuu watched it unfold on her tactical display, watched red icons blink out one by one, watched the Federation fleet systematically dismantle what remained of the Ryzak invasion force.

Seven hours and fifty-two minutes. That's how long the battle for Sol had lasted, from the moment the Ryzak fleet had emerged at the beacon to now.

And it was ending in less than five minutes.

> "All Talon squadrons, this is Admiral Trager. Stand down from combat operations. Third North Fleet has the situation under control. Return to Galileo Station for debrief and rest. You've earned it."

Okuu felt something in her chest unclench, something she hadn't realized was wound tight for nearly four hours of continuous combat. Stand down. Return to station. It was over.

She keyed her squadron channel.

> "Hell Ravens, you heard the Admiral. We're done. Form up on me. Let's go home."

The Japanese Talons turned toward Galileo Station, engines burning, leaving the battle behind them. Around them, other squadrons were doing the same. Portuguese, American, Federation—all of them vectoring toward the station, all of them standing down.

Behind them, Third North Fleet continued its work, hunting down the last Ryzak vessels, eliminating the threat, ensuring that nothing would threaten Earth.

Okuu looked at her tactical display one more time, at the nineteen blue icons representing the Federation fleet, at the dwindling number of red icons representing what remained of the Ryzak invasion force.

These are ours, she thought. These ships, these crews, these people who just traveled through a hole in space-time and ended an eight-hour siege in minutes.

They're humans, like us.

And they're here to help.

Galileo Station appeared ahead, still there, still intact, its shields down to twenty-eight percent but holding. The station that had become the focal point of humanity's desperate defense, the station that had held the line while waiting for help to arrive.

Help that had finally come.

Okuu guided her Talon toward the docking bay, following the approach vector, ready to step out of her cockpit for the first time in nearly four hours.

The battle for Sol was over.

And humanity had won.
