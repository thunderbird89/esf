## Chapter 1: The Theft

### The Watering Hole

The bar occupied the lower level of a docking station on the Xenari frontier world of Thal'karesh, where the air tasted of recycled atmosphere and the faint metallic tang of starship fuel. It was the sort of establishment where officers from a dozen different species mingled after long patrols, where the lighting was kept deliberately dim, and where questions were politely not asked.

The Kryllian bartender—a stocky figure in his breathing apparatus—moved with practiced efficiency behind the counter, dispensing drinks with mechanical precision. The clientele tonight was typical: a pair of Seraphyn in the corner booth engaged in what appeared to be a philosophical debate conducted entirely through subtle gestures and occasional soft vocalizations, a cluster of off-duty cargo haulers comparing routes near the window, and scattered throughout, the tall, angular figures of Xenari officers on leave.

One such officer sat alone at the bar, his bioluminescent markings pulsing a steady cyan-green that suggested contentment and mild inebriation. Commander Vael'thi had reason to celebrate—his patrol rotation was complete, his ship was due for refit, and he had two full cycles of leave ahead of him before his next assignment. The drink in front of him was his third, a sweet fermented beverage from his homeworld that the Kryllian bartender kept specifically for Xenari customers.

He didn't notice the woman who slid onto the stool beside him until she spoke.

> "Commander Vael'thi?"

Her voice was smooth, with an accent he couldn't quite place—somewhere between the precise articulation of core-world Xenari and the broader tones of outer colonies. He turned to look at her.

She was striking. Roughly his height when standing, with the lean build and graceful movements of a Xenari, but her coloring was unusual—skin tone somewhere between pale blue and silver, with bioluminescent markings that pulsed a warm violet-pink that his instincts read as interest and curiosity. Her large eyes caught the dim light, pupils dilated in the low illumination. She wore civilian clothing, well-tailored but not ostentatious, and carried herself with a confidence that suggested military background.

> "I'm sorry," Vael'thi said, his words slightly slurred. "Do I know you?"

> "Not yet," she said, her markings brightening slightly. "But I've heard about you. The successful interdiction of that Ryzak probe ship three cycles ago? That was impressive work."

Vael'thi's own markings brightened to blue-white—pride mixed with pleasure at the recognition. The probe ship incident had indeed been noteworthy, though it hadn't received wide publicity outside military channels.

> "How did you hear about that?"

> "I work logistics coordination at the orbital yards," she said smoothly. "We see all the repair requisitions. The damage patterns on your ship told an interesting story." She gestured to the bartender. "Whatever the Commander is drinking, and one for me."

The Kryllian bartender set down two glasses without comment.

> "I'm Shael'na," she said, lifting her glass. "To successful patrols and well-earned leave."

Vael'thi touched his glass to hers, the gentle clink of crystalline material musical in the ambient noise. The drink was good, the company was pleasant, and his markings continued to pulse contentment.

They talked. She asked intelligent questions about patrol routes, about the challenges of maintaining readiness in frontier sectors, about the differences between commanding a frigate versus larger vessels. He found himself enjoying the conversation, enjoying her attention. Her markings shifted through shades of violet and soft blue, her body language open and engaged. When she laughed at one of his stories, the sound was genuine.

The fourth drink appeared without him ordering it. Then the fifth.

Somewhere around the sixth drink, Vael'thi noticed his coordination was declining. His large eyes had trouble focusing, and his bioluminescent markings were flickering irregularly—a sign of significant intoxication that his training told him should concern him more than it currently did.

> "I think," he said carefully, "I may have had too much."

> "Probably," Shael'na agreed, her own markings still steady and controlled. "But you're on leave. You've earned it."

She shifted closer on her stool, and he caught her scent—something that his hindbrain registered as appealing, though he couldn't identify why. Her hand rested briefly on his arm, and he felt the warmth of her touch through his uniform sleeve.

> "Your comm unit," she said, gesturing to the small device clipped to his belt. "Is that a command-grade model? I've only seen those in technical specifications."

> "Hmm?" Vael'thi looked down, his vision doubling slightly. "Oh. Yes. Fleet coordination. We need the secure channels."

> "Can I see it? I've always wondered how they compare to standard issue."

Without thinking, his fingers fumbled at the clip. The alcohol had dulled his natural caution, the caution that would normally have recognized the breach of protocol, the security risk. His hands weren't responding properly, clumsy and slow.

> "Here, let me," Shael'na said, her fingers deft as they unclipped the device. She turned it over in her hands, examining it with apparent interest. "The encryption module is integrated? That must make it heavier than standard units."

> "Bit heavier," Vael'thi agreed. His words were starting to slur more noticeably. "But worth it for the security."

She held it for perhaps fifteen seconds, her fingers moving over the surface with practiced ease. When she handed it back, he took it without question, his intoxicated brain registering nothing unusual.

> "Fascinating," she said. "Thank you for indulging my curiosity."

She glanced at her wrist, where a small chrono was embedded. Her markings flickered briefly—a pattern he couldn't quite interpret in his current state.

> "I should let you get some rest," she said, standing smoothly. "You look like you could use it. Enjoy your leave, Commander."

> "Wait," Vael'thi said, his hand reaching out clumsily. "Will I see you again?"

Her markings shifted to something that might have been regret, or might have been satisfaction. It was hard to tell.

> "Perhaps," she said. "The galaxy is smaller than we think."

She moved through the crowd with fluid grace, and Vael'thi watched her go, his vision blurring at the edges. He tried to stand, found his legs less cooperative than expected, and settled for ordering one more drink instead.

The Kryllian bartender served it without comment, his breathing apparatus hissing softly.

---

Three blocks away, in a narrow access corridor between docking bays, the woman who had called herself Shael'na ducked into a maintenance alcove. Her markings—artificial bioluminescence generated by the holographic mask—dimmed to nothing as she reached up and carefully peeled the gossamer-thin material from her features.

Beneath the mask, Operative Kresh'tar's reptilian features were set in grim satisfaction. Her thick scaled hide was a mottled pattern of dark greens and grays, and her secondary eyelids flickered as she adjusted to the change in appearance. The Ryzak intelligence officer flexed her clawed hands, relieved to be free of the uncomfortable disguise.

The holographic technology was sophisticated enough to fool Xenari recognition systems, even to replicate the false warmth of their body temperature. But it couldn't replicate their frailty, their lack of physical strength. Kresh'tar's natural Ryzak physiology—powerful, predatory, built for combat—had required conscious effort to suppress throughout the entire interaction. The mask had done the visual work, but the performance had been all hers.

She pulled a small device from her pocket—an intelligence ministry scanner, compact and purpose-built. When she'd held Vael'thi's comm unit, when she'd examined it with apparent curiosity, the scanner had been pressed against the encryption module, copying its quantum-paired key signatures in a fraction of a second.

The small display confirmed successful acquisition. The encryption keys for Xenari fleet coordination channels, complete with the necessary authentication protocols. Temporary access, perhaps only a few cycles before the theft would be discovered and the keys cycled, but temporary was all they needed.

Kresh'tar allowed herself a moment of satisfaction. The Xenari officer would wake tomorrow with a headache and a vague memory of pleasant conversation. By the time he realized anything was wrong—if he ever did—it would be far too late.

She activated her secure comm, the signal heavily encrypted and routed through three relay points to obscure its origin.

> "Kresh'tar to Operations. Package acquired. Authentication successful. Transmitting now."

The response came immediately, her handler's voice crisp and professional.

> "Confirmed. Return to extraction point. Transport is waiting."

Kresh'tar peeled off the remainder of her disguise—the civilian clothing that concealed her true bulk, the soft shoes that hid her clawed feet—and stowed them in a disposal unit. Beneath, she wore the dark combat suit of Ryzak intelligence, form-fitting and functional.

She moved through the maintenance corridors with the confident stride of a predator, her movements now unrestricted by the need to mimic Xenari grace. The transport would take her back to Ryzak space. Her superiors would decrypt the data. And then, finally, they would have what they needed.

Access to the Xenari jump network.

The Federation had humiliated them. Those mysterious human representatives, operating with Xenari backing, had defied Ryzak superiority again and again. The *Cormorant* gambit, the ambush that had cost them three frigates and valuable intelligence operatives. The other encounters, each one ending in unexpected resistance and Ryzak losses.

But the Federation was small, secretive, operating in the shadows. The humans themselves—billions of them on their homeworld—had never faced the Ryzak. Had never even met an alien species. They were defenseless, unaware, completely unprepared for what was coming.

But no longer.

If the humans wanted to hide behind Xenari protection, then the Ryzak would simply remove that protection. A pre-emptive strike, executed before the humans could coordinate with their benefactors, before the Xenari could respond with their superior numbers.

Sol system had no stargate. Without a jump beacon, interstellar travel to the system was impossible—the only way in or out was through the Xenari jump beacon near Jupiter. And with the encryption keys now in Ryzak possession, that beacon could be accessed. A subjugation flotilla could bridge directly into the system, bypass the normal security protocols, and strike before anyone knew they were coming.

Kresh'tar's mandibles clicked in anticipation.

The humans would learn what it meant to face the Ryzak when they weren't hiding behind their mysterious benefactors and their stolen technology.

And Earth would burn.

### The Morning After

Vael'thi woke to sunlight streaming through the viewport of his quarters, the warm glow of the system's star cutting through the thin curtains. His head throbbed with the steady rhythm of a fusion reactor running just slightly out of phase. His bioluminescent markings pulsed a sickly grayish-blue—the biological equivalent of a hangover warning light.

He groaned, his long limbs tangled in the bedding, and tried to piece together the previous evening. The bar. Celebrating the end of patrol rotation. Drinks. Too many drinks. And—

A woman. Shael'na. Silver-blue skin, violet markings, intelligent questions about ship operations. They'd talked for hours. Or had it been hours? The timeline was hazy, edges blurred by alcohol and poor judgment.

Vael'thi dragged himself upright, his coordination still slightly off. He needed water, analgesics, and approximately six more hours of sleep. In that order.

He stumbled to the small kitchenette, filled a container with water from the dispenser, and drank it in long gulps. His body's biofilm layer felt dehydrated, his skin texture rough. The water helped, marginally.

As cognitive function gradually returned, fragments of conversation surfaced from the alcoholic fog. Patrol routes. Frigate operations. The probe ship interdiction. And—

His comm unit.

The thought arrived with sudden, cold clarity that cut through the hangover like a blade.

She'd asked to see his comm unit. He'd given it to her. No—she'd unclipped it for him because his hands weren't working properly. She'd held it, examined it, asked about the encryption module.

Vael'thi's markings flickered from grayish-blue to dim, uncertain violet. That was protocol violation. Command-grade communications equipment was never to be handled by unauthorized personnel. Never. It was drilled into every officer from their first day of training.

He found the device still clipped to his uniform belt, discarded on the floor where he'd dropped it. The unit looked normal, unmarked, undamaged. He activated it, watching the display come to life with standard startup sequences. Everything appeared functional.

But appearance wasn't the same as security.

Vael'thi stood there for a long moment, water container still in hand, his analytical mind now fully engaged despite the headache. He tried to recall details. Her face—attractive, memorable, but had he seen her before last night? Her accent—she'd said she worked logistics coordination at the orbital yards. That was verifiable. The conversation topics—all professional, all appropriate, nothing that screamed intelligence operative.

Except she'd gotten him drunk, gotten him to hand over secure equipment, and then disappeared.

His markings shifted to rapid flickering violet-pink—intense focus mixed with growing alarm.

He needed to report this. Immediately.

Vael'thi dressed quickly, his movements now sharp and deliberate despite the lingering effects of intoxication. He grabbed a standard-issue comm unit from his desk—not the command-grade one, which was now potentially compromised—and activated the secure channel to station security.

The response came within seconds, a crisp male voice.

> "Security. Go ahead."

> "This is Commander Vael'thi, CNS *Vigilant*. I need to report a potential security breach. Command-grade communications equipment may have been compromised."

There was a pause, brief but significant.

> "Stand by, Commander. Patching you to Intelligence."

The hold lasted perhaps ten seconds before a new voice came on the line, female, with the clipped precision of someone who dealt with worst-case scenarios professionally.

> "Commander Vael'thi, this is Lieutenant Shal'mir, Station Intelligence. Describe the incident."

Vael'thi did, his words precise despite the embarrassment burning through his system. The bar, the drinks, the woman calling herself Shael'na, the examination of his comm unit. He left nothing out, including the excessive alcohol consumption and his impaired judgment.

> "How long did she have physical access to the device?"

> "Fifteen seconds. Perhaps twenty."

> "Did you observe her manipulating the interface?"

> "No. She examined it visually, appeared to be checking the weight and form factor."

Another pause, longer this time.

> "Commander, I need you to bring that comm unit to Intelligence immediately. Do not use it for any communications. Do not connect it to any networks. Physical courier only. Understood?"

> "Understood."

> "And Commander? You mentioned she claimed to work logistics coordination. Did she provide a department or supervisor name?"

Vael'thi's markings dimmed. He hadn't asked. He'd been too drunk, too flattered by the attention, too caught up in the conversation to verify basic information.

> "No. She didn't volunteer it, and I didn't ask."

> "We'll pull security footage from the bar. Description?"

Vael'thi provided it—height, build, coloring, the distinctive silver-blue skin tone and violet markings. As he spoke, a cold certainty settled in his chest. The coloring was unusual. He'd remarked on it mentally at the time, but hadn't questioned it.

Because she was attractive, and he was drunk, and his judgment had been catastrophically compromised.

> "Intelligence will meet you at the security checkpoint in ten minutes. Move now, Commander."

The connection terminated.

Vael'thi looked at the command-grade comm unit in his hand, the device that represented his authority, his access, his responsibility. Fifteen seconds had been more than enough time to copy data, to clone authentication protocols, to compromise everything it represented.

He moved toward the door, his headache forgotten, replaced by a much worse pain—the knowledge that his mistake might have consequences far beyond personal embarrassment.

### Fleet Command

Admiral Thresh'nal's bioluminescent markings pulsed a steady, controlled blue as he reviewed the preliminary intelligence report. His office aboard the orbital station was austere by Xenari standards—minimal decoration, maximum functionality, with viewports showing the curved horizon of Thal'karesh below and the scattered lights of the docked fleet visible against the black.

Lieutenant Shal'mir stood before his desk, her posture formal, her own markings showing the rapid violet flicker of someone delivering very bad news to a superior officer.

> "Security footage confirms an individual matching Commander Vael'thi's description entered and exited the establishment at the times he specified," she said. "However, we cannot find any record of this individual in station personnel databases. No Shael'na working logistics coordination. No one matching that description with current authorization codes."

Thresh'nal's markings dimmed slightly—controlled concern.

> "Biometric scan of the footage?"

> "Inconclusive. The individual's biosignature reads as Xenari, but the coloring doesn't match any known regional variations in our database. The bioluminescent patterns appear natural, but they're... unusual. Our analysts flag a probability of sixty-three percent that the appearance was artificially generated."

> "Disguise technology."

> "Yes, sir. We're cross-referencing with known intelligence capabilities of neighboring powers. The Ryzak have demonstrated advanced infiltration techniques in previous incidents."

Thresh'nal stood, his tall frame unfolding from the chair with characteristic Xenari grace. He moved to the viewport, his reflection ghostly in the transparent material.

> "Commander Vael'thi's comm unit?"

> "Our technical team is analyzing it now. Preliminary scans show no obvious tampering, no inserted hardware, no modifications to the encryption module. However—"

> "However?"

> "The quantum signature logs show a brief external connection approximately matching the timeframe when the device was in the stranger's possession. Fourteen point three seconds of active scanning. The connection was sophisticated enough to avoid triggering the unit's intrusion detection, but it left traces in the deeper system logs."

Thresh'nal's markings shifted through several colors in rapid succession—blue-white alarm, violet focus, then settling into a dim, controlled cyan that indicated strategic thinking.

> "They copied the encryption keys."

> "That's our assessment, sir. Fleet coordination keys, authentication protocols, possibly jump beacon access codes."

> "Which beacons?"

> "Commander Vael'thi's security clearance provides access to seventeen frontier beacons, including—" Shal'mir consulted her datapad, "—the Sol system beacon."

The silence that followed was profound.

Sol system. The protected zone. The human homeworld, where the Federation operated as humanity's secret representatives in galactic affairs. The system had no stargate, and without a jump beacon, interstellar travel was impossible—the single Xenari jump beacon maintained near Jupiter was the only way in or out, used exclusively for covert Federation transport.

A beacon that could now be accessed by anyone with the stolen encryption keys.

> "Time to compromise," Thresh'nal said, his voice steady despite the implications.

> "Unknown, sir. If they copied the keys in that fourteen-second window, they could have transmitted them immediately. Best case, we're looking at several hours since initial compromise. Worst case—"

> "Worst case, they already have ships en route."

> "Yes, sir."

Thresh'nal turned from the viewport, his markings now pulsing the rapid blue-white that indicated decisive action.

> "Alert the Great Circle. Full security protocol. I want fleet-wide encryption key rotation initiated immediately. All beacons, all channels, all authentication codes. How long for the rotation to propagate?"

Shal'mir's markings flickered—calculation mixed with concern.

> "Full fleet rotation will take eighteen hours minimum, sir. Priority channels can be rotated in six hours, but the remote beacons—especially those in protected zones like Sol—operate on longer refresh cycles. We're looking at twenty-four to thirty-six hours for complete network security restoration."

> "Make it happen. Priority authorization from my office. And Lieutenant?"

> "Sir?"

> "Send encrypted warning to the Sol beacon. Inform our contacts in the Federation that their security may be compromised. They need to prepare for possible Ryzak incursion."

Shal'mir's markings pulsed acknowledgment. She turned to leave, then hesitated.

> "Sir, if the Ryzak are planning a strike on Sol, why steal encryption keys instead of simply assembling a force at the border?"

Thresh'nal's markings dimmed to somber violet.

> "Because CONCORD would detect the fleet assembly and issue sanctions before they could reach the system. But a smaller force, using our own jump beacon and our own encryption? They could bridge directly into Sol system, bypass all border security, and achieve complete tactical surprise."

> "A pre-emptive strike."

> "Exactly. Disable the humans before they can coordinate with us, before the Federation can respond, before anyone knows the Ryzak have arrived. By the time we detect the incursion, Earth could be burning."

Shal'mir's bioluminescent markings flickered rapid violet-pink—the pattern that indicated a Xenari processing deeply disturbing implications.

> "The Federation has proven resourceful, sir. They've repelled Ryzak forces before."

> "The Federation," Thresh'nal corrected, his markings pulsing somber violet. "A small, covert organization operating as humanity's representatives. The humans themselves have never encountered alien species. Never faced combat in space. They don't even know the Ryzak exist." He paused. "The Federation might hold against a probe or reconnaissance element. But a dedicated subjugation flotilla, arriving without warning, targeting Earth directly? The humans won't know what hit them."

He moved back to his desk, already pulling up fleet disposition maps and communication protocols.

> "Send the warning. Begin the key rotation. And pray that we're not already too late."

### Ryzak War Council

The command chamber aboard the dreadnought *Bloodfang* was a study in controlled aggression. Dark metal walls bore the scars of countless ritualized duels, and the air carried the scent of heated metal and the musk of Ryzak warriors. High Admiral Kraveth stood before the tactical display, his massive frame silhouetted against the holographic representation of known space. His scales were dark green, almost black, marked with the pale scars of a hundred battles.

Around the chamber, his senior officers waited in disciplined silence. Two carrier captains, four battleship commanders, the cruiser squadron leader, and the destroyer flotilla commander. All bore the clan markings of elite warrior castes, and all had proven themselves in combat trials.

Kraveth's clawed hand gestured at the display, and a section expanded—the Sol system, marked in red as a protected zone, with a single Xenari jump beacon icon pulsing near the outer planets.

> "The encryption keys are verified," he said, his voice a low rumble that carried the weight of authority. "Intelligence confirms full access to Xenari jump network protocols. The window of opportunity is measured in cycles, perhaps less. The Xenari will rotate their keys once they discover the theft."

Captain Vorash, commander of the carrier *Stormbreaker*, flexed his claws in anticipation.

> "The Federation operatives have been a persistent irritant. This is our opportunity to eliminate them at their source."

> "Not just eliminate," Kraveth corrected. "Subjugate. The humans are a minor species, barely aware of the galaxy beyond their system. Their Federation is small—perhaps a few thousand operatives at most, scattered across various operations. The billions on their homeworld are defenseless."

Commander Threx of the battleship *Warbringer* leaned forward, his secondary eyelids flickering.

> "The Federation has demonstrated unusual combat effectiveness despite their limited numbers. The *Cormorant* incident—"

> "Was an ambush," Kraveth interrupted, his mandibles clicking dismissively. "A clever trap, yes. But it required preparation, positioning, and the element of surprise. We will not grant them that luxury this time."

He manipulated the display, bringing up fleet disposition data.

> "The Federation's successes stem from operating in the shadows, from choosing when and where to engage. They strike probe ships, reconnaissance elements, isolated patrols. They have never faced a dedicated battle fleet."

> "Intelligence estimates their total combat strength?" asked Captain Hresh of the carrier *Doombringer*.

> "Unknown with certainty," Kraveth admitted. "But based on observed engagements, we estimate no more than thirty to fifty combat vessels, mostly small craft. Fighters, interceptors, perhaps a handful of corvettes or light frigates. They lack the industrial base for larger capital ships."

The officers exchanged glances. By Ryzak standards, that was barely a screening force.

> "The humans themselves have no space combat capability," Kraveth continued. "Their most advanced vessels are primitive chemical rockets capable of reaching their moon. They have satellites, space stations, but nothing that qualifies as military hardware by galactic standards."

Captain Vorash's claws drummed against the tactical display's edge.

> "Then why the protected zone designation? Why does CONCORD shield them?"

> "Politics," Kraveth said, the word carrying contempt. "The Xenari sponsor them. The Seraphyn find them interesting. CONCORD maintains the fiction of protection to preserve diplomatic balance." His scales rippled with satisfaction. "But if we strike quickly, decisively, before anyone can respond? By the time CONCORD convenes to discuss sanctions, the humans will be under our control."

Commander Gresh of the cruiser squadron spoke, his voice measured.

> "The Xenari will not simply accept this. They will respond."

> "Eventually," Kraveth agreed. "But their nearest battle fleets are positioned at frontier stations, monitoring other border regions. By the time they mobilize and transit to Sol, we will have established orbital supremacy and begun ground operations. CONCORD will negotiate a settlement rather than risk open warfare between great powers."

He expanded the tactical display to show the proposed fleet composition.

> "Two combat groups. Two carriers, four battleships, four cruisers, eight destroyers, sixteen frigates. Sufficient force to overwhelm any Federation presence, establish orbital control, and begin systematic pacification of the human homeworld."

The numbers were substantial—enough firepower to reduce a planetary surface to molten slag if necessary, though subjugation was more profitable than destruction.

Captain Hresh examined the display.

> "Jump beacon protocol? The Xenari beacon will detect our approach signature."

> "The stolen keys include authentication protocols," Kraveth said. "We will transmit as Xenari vessels conducting authorized transit. By the time they realize the deception, we will already be in-system."

> "The carriers will deploy strike craft immediately upon emergence," Vorash added. "Establish combat air patrol, suppress any Federation response."

> "Battleships form the main battle line," Kraveth continued, gesturing at the display. "Cruisers provide fire support and screening. Destroyers handle escort duties and point defense. Frigates conduct reconnaissance and pursuit operations."

Commander Threx nodded slowly.

> "When do we deploy?"

> "Immediately." Kraveth's mandibles clicked with finality. "The encryption keys have a limited operational window. Intelligence estimates twenty to thirty cycles before the Xenari complete their key rotation. We must bridge into Sol system within the next twelve cycles to ensure access."

He straightened to his full height, scales reflecting the red glow of the tactical display.

> "The humans have embarrassed us through their Federation puppets for the last time. We will demonstrate what happens when a minor species dares to resist the Ryzak Empire. Earth will burn, or it will kneel. Either outcome is acceptable."

The assembled officers struck their chests in unison, the sound like thunder in the confined space.

> "For the Empire!"

> "For the Empire," Kraveth echoed. "Fleet commanders, return to your vessels. Begin jump calculations for Sol system. Target coordinates will be transmitted using the stolen authentication protocols. We deploy in six cycles."

As the officers filed out, Captain Vorash lingered.

> "Admiral, if I may—the Federation operatives have demonstrated tactical creativity that exceeds what we typically see from minor species. The *Cormorant* gambit showed sophisticated understanding of our doctrine."

Kraveth's secondary eyelids flickered—acknowledgment without agreement.

> "They are clever, yes. Resourceful. But cleverness has limits when facing overwhelming force. Two combat groups represent more firepower than they have encountered in all their previous engagements combined." He turned to face Vorash fully. "You have concerns?"

> "Caution, Admiral. Not concerns. The humans are unpredictable."

> "All prey is unpredictable when cornered," Kraveth said. "It changes nothing. We have superior numbers, superior firepower, and complete tactical surprise. The Federation cannot possibly muster a defense against this level of force, and the humans themselves are defenseless."

He gestured dismissively.

> "Return to your carrier, Captain. Prepare your strike wings. In twelve cycles, we will show the galaxy what happens to those who defy the Ryzak Empire."

Vorash saluted and departed.

Alone in the command chamber, Kraveth studied the tactical display. The Sol system hung there, small and insignificant, a single star among billions. The humans had no idea what was coming. Their Federation operatives might have won a few skirmishes, but they had never faced the full might of a Ryzak subjugation fleet.

His claws traced the orbital paths of Earth's moon, the inner planets, the gas giants beyond.

Six cycles to assembly.

Twelve cycles to deployment.

And then the humans would learn the price of resistance.

He activated his comm unit.

> "Fleet Operations, this is High Admiral Kraveth. Authorize combat group deployment. Authorization code: Warlord-Seven-Omega. Target designation: Sol system. Transit window: twelve cycles from my mark. Mark."

The response came immediately.

> "Acknowledged, Admiral. Fleet deployment authorized. All vessels moving to assembly point."

Kraveth watched the tactical display as icons began to shift, representing the massive warships beginning their coordination for jump operations. Two carriers, each capable of deploying hundreds of strike craft. Four battleships, mobile fortresses with enough firepower to crack planetary shields. The supporting vessels, each deadly in their own right.

The Federation had won battles.

The Ryzak Empire would win the war.

Earth's fate was already sealed.

### Galileo Station

The Federation station orbited Jupiter at a precisely calculated distance, hidden among the electromagnetic chaos of the gas giant's radiation belts. From the outside, Galileo Station appeared as little more than an irregularly shaped asteroid, its surface pitted and scarred, tumbling slowly in its orbit. The disguise was deliberate and effective. Earth's astronomers had catalogued it decades ago as minor body J2007-447, unremarkable and uninteresting.

Inside, the station housed the Federation's primary command center for Sol system operations. Three hundred personnel, mostly human with a handful of Xenari advisors, maintained constant watch over Earth's orbital space, coordinated covert operations planetside, and served as the communication relay to the wider galaxy.

Commander Sarah Chen stood in the operations center, her eyes fixed on the priority message that had just come through on the Xenari secure channel. The text was clinical, precise, and terrifying.

**PRIORITY ALPHA / XENARI FLEET COMMAND**
**TO: FEDERATION SOL STATION**
**CLASSIFICATION: CRITICAL THREAT**

**ENCRYPTION KEYS COMPROMISED. RYZAK INTELLIGENCE OPERATION CONFIRMED. EXPECT HOSTILE INCURSION SOL SYSTEM VIA JUMP BEACON. ESTIMATED FORCE: TWO COMBAT GROUPS, THIRTY-FOUR VESSELS. ESTIMATED TIME TO ARRIVAL: 8-14 CYCLES (18-32 HOURS EARTH STANDARD).**

**XENARI RESPONSE FLEETS MOBILIZING BUT CANNOT ARRIVE IN TIME TO ESTABLISH DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. KRYLLIAN PARTNERS HAVE RELEASED FEDERATION ASSETS FROM JOINT OPERATIONS. TRANSIT TIME TO SOL: MINIMUM 48 HOURS.**

**YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.**

**RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE DEFENSIVE PREPARATIONS. PROTECT HUMAN HOMEWORLD AT ALL COSTS.**

**XENARI FLEET COMMAND SENDS THEIR REGARDS AND THEIR APOLOGIES.**

Chen read it twice, her hands steady despite the ice forming in her gut. Eighteen years in the Federation, from a junior analyst to station commander, and she'd never seen a message quite like this.

> "Commander?"

She turned. Lieutenant Marcus Webb, her operations officer, stood at the tactical display, his face pale.

> "I'm reading the same message," he said quietly. "Ma'am, we have forty-two operational combat vessels in-system. Mostly Talons, a squadron of Wraiths, three corvettes. Against two Ryzak combat groups?"

Chen moved to the tactical display, where the Sol system hung in miniature, each Federation asset marked in blue. The numbers were stark. Forty-two vessels against thirty-four sounded almost even, until you factored in that the Ryzak force included two carriers with hundreds of strike craft, plus battleships that massed more than the entire Federation presence combined.

> "Pull up fleet disposition," she said. "Everything we have, operational or not."

Webb's fingers moved across the interface. Icons appeared throughout the inner system.

> "Talons: thirty-one operational, four in maintenance at Lunar Base. Wraiths: eight operational, two undergoing refit. Corvettes: three. The destroyer *Sentinel* is in dock at Station One for engine replacement. The frigate *Resolute* is on patrol in the asteroid belt but her shields are running at sixty percent. And we have the station's defensive platforms."

He paused, expanding the view to show Jupiter orbit.

> "Jovian Shipyards has three battleships. The *Typhoon* is fully operational. The *Lord Cardigan* and *Gallipoli* are both in mid-refit—weapons systems offline, shield generators being replaced, crew at half-strength."

> "Defensive platforms won't matter," Chen said flatly. "Ryzak battleships will crack them in the opening salvo. *Sentinel* can't maneuver without engines. And two battleships in refit aren't much better than scrap metal."

She studied the display, her mind racing through scenarios. Every simulation, every tactical briefing, every war game she'd participated in over the years. None of them had modeled this scenario. The Federation had always assumed the Xenari would maintain control of the jump beacon, that any Ryzak incursion would be detected and intercepted before reaching Sol.

> "What about the assets the Xenari mentioned?" Webb asked. "Our fleets operating with the Kryllians?"

> "Too far out," Chen said. "Even with immediate jump clearance, they're looking at forty-eight hours minimum transit time. The Ryzak will be here in eighteen to thirty-two hours."

> "So we fight."

> "We fight," Chen agreed. "But not alone."

Webb's eyes widened slightly.

> "You're talking about Earth."

> "I'm talking about Earth," Chen confirmed. She activated the station-wide comm. "All senior staff to Operations immediately. This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill."

Within three minutes, the operations center filled with personnel. Her XO, Lieutenant Commander James Rodriguez. Chief Engineer Patricia O'Connor. Intelligence Officer Captain David Sung. Tactical Coordinator Major Elena Petrov. And two others—the station's AI liaisons, Lieutenant Sarah Martinez and Commander Thomas Reeves.

> "Priority message from Xenari Fleet Command," Chen said without preamble. "Ryzak incursion expected within eighteen to thirty-two hours. Two combat groups. Thirty-four vessels including carriers and battleships."

The silence was absolute.

> "Our response assets?" Rodriguez asked, his voice carefully controlled.

> "Insufficient," Chen said. "Even if we pull every operational vessel, every fighter, every platform, we're outgunned by a factor of ten. The Ryzak carriers alone can deploy enough strike craft to overwhelm our point defense."

> "Federation reinforcements?" O'Connor asked.

> "Forty-eight hours minimum. The Ryzak will be here in less than half that time."

Major Petrov leaned forward, her hands flat on the tactical display.

> "Then we need to call in the markers."

Chen nodded slowly. Over the past five years, the Federation had quietly transferred advanced technology to several Earth governments. Portugal's Talons. The Japanese trials. The American integration program. NATO pilot training. It had been done carefully, incrementally, preparing Earth for the day when the truth about the galaxy could no longer be hidden.

That day had arrived ahead of schedule.

> "If we activate Earth's assets," Rodriguez said carefully, "we expose the Federation. We expose everything we've been building. The secrecy, the careful introduction of technology—it all ends."

> "It ends anyway when Ryzak battleships start bombarding population centers," Petrov countered. "We can manage the diplomatic fallout later. Right now, we need every available combat asset."

Captain Sung pulled up intelligence assessments.

> "Portugal has twenty-five Talons operational or near-operational. The Japanese have sixteen. The Americans have eight fully integrated plus another twelve in advanced training. That's sixty-one additional fighters if we can coordinate deployment."

> "And the political implications?" Rodriguez asked. "We're talking about revealing alien contact to the entire planet. Mass panic, government destabilization, religious upheaval—"

> "All of which is preferable to extinction," Chen interrupted. Her voice was quiet but carried absolute certainty. "We can manage panic. We can manage political fallout. We cannot manage a Ryzak occupation."

She straightened, her decision made.

> "Lieutenant Martinez, Commander Reeves. Contact HARBINGER and SUNTZU. I need strategic analysis and coordination protocols. We're going to war, and we're going to need every advantage we can manufacture."

The two AI liaisons moved to their stations. Within seconds, the holographic displays flickered to life with two distinct presences.

HARBINGER materialized first—a shifting geometric pattern that suggested rather than depicted a humanoid form, rendered in cool blues and silvers. The AI's voice was calm, almost soothing, with a faint electronic undertone.

> "Commander Chen. I have reviewed the Xenari warning. Situation assessment: critical. Probability of successful defense without additional assets: twelve percent."

> "We're calling Earth," Chen said. "Full activation of all transferred assets. I need you to coordinate communications with the governments involved. Portugal, Japan, United States. Anyone else who has operational hardware."

> "Acknowledged. Recommendation: immediate notification to all parties. Optimal scenario requires eighteen hours minimum preparation time for coordinated response."

SUNTZU manifested beside HARBINGER, its form more angular, aggressive, rendered in deep reds and golds. Where HARBINGER suggested patience and coordination, SUNTZU embodied decisive action.

> "Fleet disposition analysis complete," SUNTZU said, its voice deeper, more resonant. "Ryzak force composition suggests orbital superiority doctrine followed by ground assault. They will attempt to establish space control before engaging surface targets. This provides tactical opportunity."

> "Explain," Chen said.

> "Ryzak doctrine prioritizes destroying orbital assets before surface bombardment. They will engage Federation vessels first. This provides window for Earth forces to deploy and establish defensive positions. If we coordinate emergence points, we can create multiple engagement zones, prevent Ryzak fleet from concentrating firepower."

HARBINGER's geometric pattern shifted, incorporating SUNTZU's tactical data.

> "Strategic synthesis: Federation forces engage immediately upon Ryzak emergence, draw their attention. Earth forces deploy from planetary surface once Ryzak commit to engagement vectors. Multi-vector attack complicates Ryzak targeting solutions, forces them to divide capital ship fire support."

> "It's still a long shot," Rodriguez said quietly.

> "Twelve percent without Earth assets," HARBINGER confirmed. "Forty-one percent with full Earth deployment and optimal coordination. However, Commander, may I reframe the tactical objective?"

Chen looked at the AI's shifting geometric form.

> "Go ahead."

> "Federation reinforcements arrive in forty-eight hours," HARBINGER said. "The Ryzak arrive in eighteen to thirty-two hours. Our objective is not to defeat two combat groups. Our objective is to stall them for sixteen to eighteen hours. Once Federation battle fleets arrive, the Ryzak force becomes tactically untenable."

SUNTZU's angular form pulsed agreement.

> "Correct tactical assessment. We do not need to win. We need to survive. Ryzak doctrine emphasizes decisive engagement. If we deny them quick victory, force extended combat, reduce their strategic momentum—Federation reinforcements will arrive with overwhelming force."

SUNTZU's form flickered as it processed additional data.

> "Additional strategic asset: Jovian Shipyards. Two battleships currently in refit status. If we prioritize emergency deployment protocols, rush critical systems online, we can deploy *Lord Cardigan* and *Gallipoli* approximately three to four hours after Ryzak emergence. They will not be optimal—reduced crew efficiency, secondary systems incomplete—but operational battleship-grade firepower."

> "And *Typhoon*?" Chen asked.

> "Fully operational. Can take defensive position immediately. Three battleships alter Ryzak tactical calculus significantly. Their carriers will need to dedicate strike craft to capital ship suppression rather than fighter superiority, and their battleships will need to primary ours, leaving them unable to engage the station or smaller vessels."

> "Probability of survival for sixteen hours?" Chen asked.

> "With Earth assets and optimal coordination: seventy-three percent," HARBINGER said. "The timeline favors defense. Every hour we hold reduces Ryzak tactical options and increases probability of reinforcement arrival."

Chen looked at the faces around her. These people had trained for this moment, had dedicated their lives to protecting Earth from threats the planet didn't even know existed. Now the bill had come due.

> "HARBINGER, draft priority communications to all Earth governments with active technology transfers. Authorization code Chen-Alpha-Seven. Tell them the truth. Tell them we're out of time. And tell them we need every pilot, every aircraft, every weapons system they can put in space within eighteen hours."

> "SUNTZU, begin strategic coordination. I want defensive positions, engagement zones, fall-back vectors. We're not trying to destroy them. We're trying to hold them for sixteen hours until our reinforcements arrive. Design the defense accordingly."

Both AIs pulsed acknowledgment.

> "Commander Chen," HARBINGER said, its voice carrying unusual weight, "this action will fundamentally alter Earth's relationship with the galaxy. There is no returning to secrecy once this begins."

> "I know," Chen said quietly. "But better Earth knows the truth and survives than dies in ignorance."

SUNTZU's angular form shifted, a gesture that might have been approval.

> "The enemy has chosen the time and place of this battle. We will choose how it is fought. Beginning strategic coordination now."

Chen turned back to the tactical display, watching as SUNTZU began plotting defensive positions, engagement vectors, fallback lines. Somewhere out there, a Ryzak fleet was preparing to jump. Earth didn't know they were coming. The governments she was about to contact would have less than a day to process the existence of aliens, absorb the reality of an invasion, and deploy their forces.

It should have been impossible.

But they didn't need to win. They just needed to survive long enough for help to arrive.

> "All hands," she said into the station comm, her voice carrying throughout Galileo Station. "Battle stations. This is not a drill. Ryzak incursion expected within thirty-two hours. We are going to defensive posture Alpha. And we are calling Earth."

She closed the comm and looked at her staff.

> "We've spent twenty years preparing Earth for first contact. We just ran out of time for a gentle introduction. HARBINGER, send the messages. SUNTZU, coordinate our response. Everyone else—let's figure out how we're going to hold off two Ryzak combat groups for sixteen hours."

HARBINGER's form pulsed once.

> "Messages transmitting on all secure channels. Priority Alpha authorization. Earth governments will receive notification within the hour."

> "And God help us all," Rodriguez muttered.

Chen didn't respond. She was watching the countdown timer that SUNTZU had placed on the main display.

**ESTIMATED RYZAK ARRIVAL: 27 HOURS, 43 MINUTES**

The clock was running. Out in the galaxy, Federation ships were warping gate-to-gate, rushing to the closest available jump bridge to get them home. Somewhere, a Ryzak supercarrier was already spooling to create a wormhole bridging lightyears to drop their ships into Sol. On Earth, phones would soon start to ring, and high-ranking people would be getting some unexpected visits. The dice were cast and the pieces dropping into place.

Earth's awakening had begun.

## Chapter 2: Wakeup Call

### The White House

President Donald Trump was not in a good mood.

He'd been asleep for maybe three hours when the Secret Service detail burst into the residence, their urgency cutting through the usual protocols. No apologies, no explanations, just firm hands guiding him toward hastily provided clothes and insistent voices repeating that he needed to come with them immediately.

Now, at 3:47 AM, he stalked down the corridor toward the Situation Room, still buttoning his shirt, flanked by agents whose expressions told him this wasn't a drill and wasn't negotiable. Chief of Staff Susie Wiles hurried alongside him, her phone pressed to her ear, her face pale.

> "What is this about?" Trump demanded. "Wiles, talk to me. Russia? China?"

> "Sir, I don't—they won't say. The Joint Chiefs are already in the Situation Room. They said you needed to see it yourself."

That didn't improve his mood. The door to the Situation Room stood open, light spilling into the hallway. Trump could hear voices inside, tense and clipped. He pushed through.

The room was packed. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Charles Brown stood at the head of the table, his uniform crisp despite the hour. Around him, the other service chiefs occupied their usual positions—General Randy George from the Army, Admiral Lisa Franchetti from the Navy, General David Allvin from the Air Force, General Eric Smith from the Marines, and General Michael Guetlein from Space Force. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stood near the wall, his expression grim.

What stopped Trump cold wasn't the assembled brass.

It was what filled every screen in the room.

The main display, the side monitors, even the smaller tactical screens—all showed the same thing. A shifting geometric pattern rendered in cool blues and silvers, vaguely humanoid in suggestion but clearly not human. The form pulsed and moved with an organic quality that made it impossible to look away.

From the speakers on the conference table, a voice was speaking. Deep, electronic, with a gravelly quality that suggested vast computational power constrained through audio hardware. The voice was mid-sentence when Trump entered.

> "—recommend immediate activation of all trained personnel. Time to orbital deployment is critical. Each hour of delay reduces defensive probability by approximately seven percent."

> "Mr. President," General Brown said, straightening. The geometric form on the screens pulsed once, as if acknowledging the interruption.

> "What the hell is that?" Trump gestured at the displays. "Some kind of hologram?"

> "Sir," General Brown said carefully, "this is HARBINGER. It's—"

> "An artificial intelligence," the voice from the speakers interrupted, smooth and patient. "Designed and deployed by the EarthSpace Federation to coordinate defensive operations for this system. President Trump, we have a critical situation requiring immediate executive action."

Trump stared at the shifting patterns on the screen, then at his Joint Chiefs, then back at the screen.

> "Artificial intelligence. Like ChatGPT?"

> "Substantially more advanced," HARBINGER replied. "Mr. President, I understand this is disorienting. You have questions. However, we are operating under severe time constraints. I need to brief you on an imminent threat to United States territory and, more broadly, to human civilization. After the briefing, you may ask whatever questions you require."

Trump pulled out a chair and sat, his eyes never leaving the displays. Wiles slid into the seat beside him, her phone now recording.

> "Talk."

The geometric form pulsed, and the main screen shifted. The shifting blue pattern moved to a corner window while the center display showed what appeared to be a star map. Earth sat at the center, rendered in familiar blue and green. Jupiter's orbit was marked in the outer system. And beyond that, at the edge of the solar system, a cluster of red icons appeared, labeled simply: "HOSTILE FORCE."

> "Twenty-three hours ago," HARBINGER began, "the Xenari—a friendly alien civilization that has been monitoring Earth for approximately eighty years—detected a security breach in their communication networks. Specifically, encryption keys for their interstellar jump beacon system were stolen by operatives from a hostile species called the Ryzak."

Trump's face went through several expressions in rapid succession. General Brown started to speak, but HARBINGER continued without pause.

> "The Ryzak are a militaristic reptilian species that controls a substantial portion of the galaxy through conquest and subjugation. They have been aware of Earth for several decades but have been unable to reach this system due to diplomatic restrictions and the absence of jump beacon access. The stolen encryption keys remove that barrier."

The display zoomed in on Jupiter, showing a single icon near its orbit.

> "The Xenari maintain a single jump beacon in Sol system, positioned near Jupiter for covert operations. Under normal circumstances, only authorized Xenari vessels can access this beacon. However, with the stolen encryption keys, the Ryzak can now use it to bridge directly into this system, bypassing all border security and achieving complete tactical surprise."

Red icons appeared near the Jupiter beacon, multiplying rapidly.

> "Based on Xenari intelligence assessments, we expect a Ryzak subjugation fleet to arrive in approximately twenty-six hours. Fleet composition: two combat groups totaling thirty-four capital ships. Two carriers capable of deploying six hundred strike craft, four battleships, supporting cruisers, destroyers, and frigates."

The room was absolutely silent. Trump's expression had moved past confusion into something harder, more focused.

> "Their objective?" he asked quietly.

> "Orbital supremacy followed by systematic occupation of Earth. The Ryzak want humanity as subjects, not allies. They view Earth as strategically valuable and humans as primitives requiring domination."

General Smith leaned forward, his Marine officer instincts engaged.

> "What's stopping them from just glassing the planet from orbit?"

> "Economics," HARBINGER replied. "Ryzak culture values conquest and subjugation. Dead worlds have no value. They will attempt to establish space control, neutralize defensive assets, and then begin ground operations. However, if faced with sufficient resistance, they are capable of orbital bombardment."

Admiral Franchetti's hands were flat on the table.

> "Mr. President, before you arrived, HARBINGER was briefing us on defensive capabilities. The EarthSpace Federation—this organization we've apparently been working with for years without knowing it—has combat vessels in-system. But they're outnumbered."

> "Forty-two operational combat craft," HARBINGER confirmed. "Against six hundred Ryzak strike fighters plus thirty-four capital ships. The Federation has also activated emergency protocols with allied governments. Portugal, Japan, and several NATO partners have received similar briefings and are mobilizing their assets."

> "Assets," Trump said. The word hung in the air. "You mean the Talons. The aircraft we've been testing."

> "Correct, Mr. President. The United States currently has eight Talon interceptors fully integrated with trained pilots, and twelve additional airframes in advanced training status. Total available force if we activate training units: twenty Talons. Portugal can field twenty-five. Japan can field sixteen. Combined Earth response: approximately one hundred twenty combat-capable spacecraft."

General Allvin pulled up additional data on his tablet.

> "Sir, the eight fully operational birds are stationed at Groom Lake. The training units are at Edwards, Nellis, and Ellington. If we start recall procedures now, we can have all twenty assembled and ready for deployment in eighteen hours."

> "Deployment where?" Trump asked. "These things can reach orbit?"

> "Yes, Mr. President," HARBINGER said. "Talons are hybrid atmospheric-space superiority fighters. They can operate from sea level to high orbit. Your pilots have been training for this exact scenario, though they were told it was theoretical."

Trump looked at General Brown.

> "Charlie, you knew about this?"

General Brown's expression was carefully neutral.

> "Sir, the program was classified above my clearance level until approximately forty minutes ago, when HARBINGER initiated this emergency protocol. I was aware we had experimental aircraft at Groom Lake. I was not aware they were designed by aliens."

> "Not designed by aliens," HARBINGER corrected. "Designed by humans, using principles and materials provided by the Xenari through the Federation. The technology is human-built, human-operated, human-maintained. The Xenari simply provided the knowledge we lacked."

> "For eighty years," Wiles said quietly. "You've been here for eighty years and we didn't know."

> "The Federation was established in 1947 following the Roswell incident," HARBINGER confirmed. "Its mandate was to prepare Earth for eventual contact with alien civilizations while maintaining global stability. That preparation now faces its first genuine test."

Trump stood, pacing to the main display. The red icons of the Ryzak fleet hung there, ominous and growing.

> "What happens if we lose?"

The room went very quiet.

> "Optimistically?" HARBINGER said. "The Ryzak occupy major population centers, establish military governance, and integrate Earth into their empire as a subject world. Pessimistically? If resistance proves too costly, they will reduce Earth to a compliant state through whatever means necessary, including orbital bombardment of resistant areas."

> "And if we win?"

> "If we hold for sixteen hours," HARBINGER said, "Federation reinforcements will arrive from allied civilizations. At that point, the Ryzak fleet becomes tactically untenable and will be forced to retreat or face destruction. However, I must stress—our objective is not victory. Our objective is survival. We need to hold long enough for help to arrive."

Trump turned back to the table.

> "Odds?"

> "Without Earth assets: twelve percent survival probability. With full coordination of all available Earth forces: seventy-three percent. The difference, Mr. President, is whether or not you authorize deployment of American combat assets."

General Guetlein from Space Force spoke up.

> "Sir, I've reviewed the tactical data HARBINGER provided. This is real. The threat assessment is real. And our pilots—they're ready for this. They might not have known why they were training, but they've been preparing for exactly this scenario."

> "How long until they're here?" Trump asked. "This Ryzak fleet."

> "Twenty-six hours, fourteen minutes," HARBINGER replied. "I need authorization to begin recall procedures for all Talon units. Every hour of preparation increases survival probability."

Trump looked at his assembled military leadership. General Brown met his eyes.

> "Sir, this is the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs. We need those aircraft in space. We need those pilots in the fight."

For a long moment, Trump stood silent, his expression unreadable. Then he turned to Wiles.

> "Get me the Speaker of the House. Get me Schumer. Get me the intelligence committee chairs. I don't care what time it is." He looked back at HARBINGER's shifting geometric form. "If we're doing this, Congress needs to know. Not asking permission—they'll get a briefing, not a debate. But they need to know."

> "Mr. President—" General Brown started.

> "Charlie, we're about to send American pilots to fight aliens. In space. Using aircraft built with alien technology. If I'm authorizing this, Congress gets briefed. Period." He turned back to the display. "HARBINGER, you have authorization to begin recall procedures for all United States Talon units. All pilots, all support personnel, everything you need. General Allvin, coordinate with this... entity. Get our people ready."

> "Yes, sir," Allvin said, already reaching for his phone.

> "General Brown, I want hourly updates. Wiles, start preparing a statement. We may need to brief the public before this is over."

> "Sir," Wiles said carefully, "if we brief the public about an alien invasion—"

> "Then they panic and we deal with it," Trump interrupted. "Better they panic knowing the truth than die in ignorance." He looked at HARBINGER. "That's what your Commander Chen said, isn't it? Better Earth knows the truth and survives?"

> "Correct, Mr. President. Commander Chen made that assessment approximately two hours ago when activating Earth response protocols."

> "Smart woman." Trump moved toward the door, then stopped. "One more thing. HARBINGER, was it?"

> "Yes, Mr. President."

> "Are we going to win this?"

The geometric form pulsed, its blue-silver patterns shifting in what might have been consideration.

> "That depends on how well we coordinate in the next twenty-six hours, how effectively our pilots perform, and whether the Ryzak make tactical errors we can exploit. The mathematics favor survival if all elements execute properly. But this will be the most significant military engagement in human history, against an enemy that has conquered dozens of civilizations."

The AI paused, its form steadying.

> "However, Mr. President, I have analyzed human military history extensively. Your species has a unique talent for survival against overwhelming odds. The Ryzak believe they are facing a primitive civilization. They are about to discover they are mistaken."

Trump nodded slowly.

> "Then let's prove them wrong." He pointed at General Allvin. "Get our people ready. We've got twenty-six hours to prepare for the fight of our lives."

He strode from the Situation Room, Wiles scrambling to keep up. Behind him, the Joint Chiefs were already moving, phones out, orders being issued. On every screen, HARBINGER's geometric form pulsed steady blue-silver, coordinating the defense of a planet that had just learned it wasn't alone in the universe.

The countdown continued.

**ESTIMATED RYZAK ARRIVAL: 26 HOURS, 11 MINUTES**
