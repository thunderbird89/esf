## Chapter 1: Diplomatic Tensions

### Scene 1: The Pressure Mounts

The conference room at the U.S. State Department was uncomfortably warm, despite the best efforts of the climate control system. Secretary of State Deborah Vance dabbed at her temple with a tissue, glancing at the growing pile of reports spread across the polished oak table. Around her, senior officials from the CIA, Pentagon, and National Security Council exchanged uneasy glances.

“Israel has increased its pressure again,” she began, her voice strained. “Ambassador Levi is demanding an explanation as to why their request for technological access has been met with silence.”

General Anthony Harding, head of the Joint Chiefs, leaned forward, his jaw tight. “It’s not just them. NATO allies are beginning to take notice. The Wraith’s deployment was too public, even with our media blackout efforts. The Israelis want what they see as their rightful share—after all, the Radbas operation indirectly supports their regional interests.”

CIA Director Daniel Harris cleared his throat. “With respect, Madam Secretary, there’s no way we can explain what we barely understand ourselves. We didn’t ‘develop’ the Wraith; we field-tested it. The Federation operates independently, and they’re as inscrutable as ever.”

Vance’s eyes narrowed. “Are you telling me that after all these years, we still have no formal way to contact them?”

Harris hesitated, then sighed. “Correct. They contact us when they deem it necessary. The technology we’ve been allowed to use is compartmentalized—restricted even from top-tier researchers at DARPA. We have no leverage and no clue how to reach them. It’s as if they’re ghosts.”

Across the table, National Security Advisor Katherine Chen spoke up, her tone measured. “We need to balance this. Israel’s political leverage is formidable. If they press Congress, we could be looking at subpoenas, hearings, and the exposure of our reliance on the Federation’s assets. That cannot happen.”

### Scene 2: A Whisper of the Federation

As the meeting adjourned, Vance lingered, staring at the Federation’s insignia—etched into the corner of an encrypted dossier. A wireframe globe encircled by laurels, crossed by two broken swords. Below it, the phrase, stark in its simplicity: **We Are Watching.**

The emblem carried weight, a reminder of their alien benefactors’ distant omnipotence. Yet the Federation’s aloofness was its own weapon, as maddening as it was effective. Vance’s frustration grew with every passing day of diplomatic deadlock.

“Madam Secretary?” It was her aide, Samantha Grey. “Ambassador Levi is requesting a private audience. He’s citing urgency.”

Vance sighed. “Tell him I’ll meet him in an hour.”

As Grey left, Vance whispered to herself, “Where are you, Federation? And what do you expect us to do when your absence becomes untenable?”

Here’s the continuation of Chapter 1:

### Scene 3: The Bluff

The office’s muted lighting reflected off the polished glass desk as Secretary Vance gestured for Ambassador Levi to sit. The Israeli diplomat adjusted his tie, his expression inscrutable as he settled into the chair across from her. A faint tension filled the air, carried by unspoken stakes.

“Ambassador,” Vance began, offering a neutral smile and interlacing her fingers on the desk, “I assure you that we are committed to ensuring our partnership remains strong. The Wraith’s technology is indeed groundbreaking, but it’s also extraordinarily complex. We are in the process of outlining how best to approach sharing it without compromising operational security—or the safety of those who deploy it.”

Levi’s brow furrowed, his head tilting slightly. “Wraith?” he said slowly. “What is this *Wraith* you mention, Madam Secretary?”

Vance’s stomach sank. The moment the word left her lips, she knew she’d slipped. The Israelis had never been briefed on the platform’s name. She held her composure, forcing her features to remain steady. 

“My apologies,” she said smoothly, though her heart raced. “It’s an internal designation—one we use for a particular operational framework. A slip of the tongue.”

Levi leaned back, studying her with the practiced scrutiny of a seasoned diplomat. “I see. And this operational framework—does it encompass the asset deployed during the Radbas operation?”

“Indeed,” Vance replied, her tone carefully modulated. “The platform in question is part of an experimental suite. Its application is highly sensitive, requiring exhaustive protocols to ensure its safety and security.”

Levi’s lips thinned. “Madam Secretary, Israel is a steadfast ally of the United States. Our cooperation has yielded countless benefits for both nations. Yet, it seems in this instance, the information flow is... unequal. My government cannot ignore the implications of what we witnessed in Iran. We are not asking for charity; we are requesting partnership. Surely that is reasonable?”

“It is,” Vance agreed, inclining her head. “And that is precisely why we are taking the time to ensure this is done correctly. This technology—let us call it the Wraith—is unlike anything either of our nations has ever worked with. Its implications extend far beyond conventional military frameworks. Sharing it prematurely could endanger not only the operators but the broader balance of security in the region.”

Levi regarded her in silence, his dark eyes searching hers for cracks in the façade. Finally, he nodded, though the tension in his shoulders remained. “You make a compelling case, Madam Secretary. But please understand, Israel cannot wait indefinitely. If the Wraith—or its ‘framework’—is as transformative as you suggest, it is imperative we gain access to it before adversaries do. My government’s patience is not unlimited.”

Vance offered a conciliatory smile. “Of course. I will personally ensure you are kept updated as we finalize the terms of collaboration.”

### Scene 4: Cracks Beneath the Surface

Levi rose, adjusting his suit as he prepared to leave. “Thank you for your candor, Madam Secretary. I will inform my government of our conversation. I trust you will not keep us waiting long.”

“As always, Ambassador, we value our alliance deeply.”

As the door closed behind him, Vance allowed herself a moment to exhale. The bluff had bought her time, but Levi’s penetrating gaze lingered in her mind. How long would he accept their stall tactics before pushing harder—potentially escalating the issue to Congress or worse?

Her intercom buzzed. Samantha Grey’s voice followed. “Madam Secretary, Director Harris is on the line. He says it’s urgent.”

Vance’s jaw tightened. The CIA. No doubt Harris had already heard about her slip. She reached for the receiver, dreading the storm that awaited her.

“Secretary Vance,” Harris’s voice was terse, almost accusatory. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done?”

### Scene 5: A Fractured Front

Vance leaned back in her chair, her grip tightening on the receiver as Director Harris’s voice crackled with barely contained fury.

“Slipped? You handed the Israelis a golden ticket! A name, Vance. A *keyword.* Do you understand what that means? They’ll dig. They’ll scour every piece of intercepted chatter, every hacked file, every whisper in the wind. And they won’t stop until they have something actionable.”

Her instinct to deflect flared. “They won’t find anything,” she countered, though her conviction wavered as she spoke. “The Federation’s operational security is airtight. Their systems, their files—none of it can be breached.”

“That’s precisely the problem, Deb—we are not the Federation!” Harris snapped. “We don’t know their playbook, let alone how they cover their tracks. The Israelis don’t need to hack the Federation; they only need to hack *us.* And god knows they can do that.” 

Vance inhaled sharply, but Harris plowed on. “Our agencies aren’t infallible. They’ll start with chatter logs, intercepted communications. Then it’s off to hacked memos, maybe cross-referencing mentions in field reports from Radbas. Before you know it, they’ll be leaning on Mossad operatives embedded in the region to probe every damn whisper. And if *anything* turns up that leads them closer to the Wraith, we’ll have a political and security disaster on our hands.”

Vance rubbed her temple, the weight of the situation pressing down on her. “You’re overreacting. We’ve been careful. Even the most sensitive information is compartmentalized. There are no breadcrumbs to follow.”

“You’re missing the point,” Harris hissed. “It’s not about breadcrumbs; it’s about determination. Israel is relentless when it comes to safeguarding their interests. They’ll brute-force every system, coerce every informant, and leverage every alliance—overt or covert—to uncover something. You think they’re just going to let this go? Not a chance.”

“What do you suggest we do?” Vance asked, her tone clipped. “It’s not as if we can undo what’s been said.”

Harris sighed audibly, his frustration palpable even through the line. “We need to go into damage control mode—yesterday. Find out exactly what assets or mentions of the Wraith are vulnerable to exposure. Sanitize everything. Redact files, isolate comm logs, pull back anything that’s been flagged even remotely related to this. We need a wall so thick that when they start digging, they hit nothing but stone.”

“Understood,” Vance replied, though unease churned in her gut. “And the Federation?”

“We can’t count on them to intervene,” Harris growled. “They keep their own counsel. We’re on our own, and you better hope that name doesn’t surface in some Mossad analyst’s keyword report.”

### Scene 6: The Ghosts in the System

After the call ended, Vance remained seated, her mind racing. Harris’s paranoia was justified; she had seen firsthand the lengths Israel could go to when pursuing leads. And the Federation—so enigmatic and aloof—provided little reassurance. Their technology might be unbreachable, their operations untraceable, but the Americans themselves were the weak link. 

Vance’s gaze fell on the encrypted dossier bearing the Federation’s insignia. “We Are Watching,” the caption read beneath the wireframe globe. She wondered bitterly if they were watching *now*—and if they even cared.

In the hallway outside her office, Samantha Grey’s voice carried faintly through the door. “Madam Secretary? There’s another message from the Israelis. They’re requesting a follow-up meeting—this week.”

Vance closed her eyes, bracing herself for the unraveling web. 

Would the Federation step in if things spiraled? Or would their shadowy benefactors leave them to face the fallout alone? She had no way of knowing—and no way of calling them to find out. The Wraith was not just a tool of covert power; it was a symbol of dependence on an entity she could not control or understand.

The ticking clock in the corner seemed to grow louder as Vance rose and squared her shoulders. Damage control would only delay the inevitable. If Harris was right, the Israelis wouldn’t stop until they found something—or until the Federation decided they’d gone too far.

### Scene 7: In the Shadow of the Wraith

The hangar lights buzzed faintly overhead, casting long shadows across the sleek, matte-black frame of the Wraith. The covert operations platform sat like a predatory bird in its cradle, its angular design and dark contours radiating menace even at rest. Harris’s boots clicked against the polished concrete as he approached, the air heavy with the hum of latent power emanating from the craft.

“Hermes,” Harris said, his voice bouncing slightly in the cavernous space. “I need to talk.”

The craft’s central AI responded instantly, its voice calm and precise, devoid of emotion. “Director Harris. How may I assist you?”

Harris glanced around, confirming they were alone. The hangar’s reinforced doors were sealed, and the perimeter was guarded by a rotating team of operatives. Satisfied, he stepped closer to the Wraith, resting a hand on the cold metal of its outer hull.

“We’re in a bind,” he admitted. “The Israelis are relentless. They’re pushing harder than ever for access to the technology that made the Radbas operation possible.”

Hermes’s voice remained neutral. “Their interest is not unexpected. Israel’s strategic priorities align closely with the capabilities demonstrated during the operation.”

“That’s one way to put it,” Harris muttered, running a hand through his hair. “They see the Wraith as their golden ticket to staying ahead of everyone else in the region. And we can’t exactly tell them, ‘Sorry, this isn’t ours to share.’ That doesn’t even scratch the surface of how much trouble we’re in.”

He paused, pacing a short distance before turning back to face the platform. “We need advice, Hermes. What do we do when our allies are pushing for answers we can’t give? When they start digging into something we can’t control? Hell, something we barely even *understand*?”

For a moment, the Wraith’s AI was silent, its internal systems emitting a faint, almost imperceptible hum. Harris felt a flicker of unease at the stillness, as though the craft itself were weighing his words.

Then, something clicked in his mind. He stopped pacing, his gaze narrowing as he stared at the Wraith. “Hermes,” he said slowly, “you’re... you’re not just an operational AI, are you? You’re the closest thing we have to a direct line to the Federation.”

“That assessment is correct,” Hermes replied evenly.

Harris exhaled sharply, realization dawning. Of course. Hermes wasn’t just the Wraith’s brain—it was their most tangible connection to the inscrutable organization that had provided the platform in the first place. The thought left him both exhilarated and unnerved.

He stepped closer. “Then I need you to relay a message to your superiors. The Israelis are demanding access to a Wraith. We need a response—something definitive, something that gets us out of this damned mess.”

For the first time, the AI hesitated. The hum from the craft grew deeper, resonating faintly in Harris’s chest. When Hermes spoke again, its voice had changed—a thunderous mechanical baritone that reverberated through the hangar like a distant storm.

“The Knesset will soon have our response.”

Harris froze. The shift in tone was like a sledgehammer, the AI’s words heavy with finality. It was a voice that brooked no argument, no doubt—a voice that carried the full weight of the Federation’s power.

“What... what does that mean?” Harris stammered, his throat dry. “What are you going to do?”

The Wraith’s systems powered down, returning the hangar to its previous stillness. Hermes’s neutral voice returned, devoid of the earlier gravitas. “The matter is being handled. No further action is required on your part.”

Harris stepped back, his pulse pounding. “Handled? How? By who?”

But the Wraith offered no answer. Its silence was absolute, and Harris was left staring at the enigmatic platform, the cold metal reflecting his own unease.

## Chapter 2: A Message Delivered

### Scene 1: A Dossier at Dawn

The Israeli prime minister’s office was silent in the early morning light, the usual hum of activity subdued by the hour. The prime minister himself, David Abramov, arrived at his desk with his usual precision, his coffee steaming in one hand and a neatly folded newspaper in the other. But it was neither the headlines nor his calendar that caught his attention—it was the thick, unmarked dossier placed squarely in the center of his desk.

His brow furrowed as he set the coffee aside. The folder was unassuming except for a single, unmistakable emblem stamped on its cover: a wireframe globe encircled by laurels, with two broken swords crossed behind it. Beneath the logo was a phrase as stark as it was chilling.

**We Are Watching.**

Abramov’s breath hitched. The Federation.

He glanced at his office door, ensuring it was shut, before taking a seat. With deliberate care, he opened the dossier, the faint scent of fresh ink wafting up. Inside, neatly arranged in plastic sleeves, were satellite images, drone footage, and printed documents. He pulled out the first set of images, his fingers trembling slightly.

### Scene 2: A Mirror Held Up

The photographs were high-resolution, showing scenes from the Gaza Strip in 2024. Abramov recognized them immediately: IDF soldiers in full combat gear, surrounding groups of unarmed civilians. Refugees crowded into makeshift camps under the harsh desert sun. Aid workers pleading with armed personnel, their faces etched with frustration and fear.

He turned the pages, the images growing more damning. A drone-captured video still showed an armored vehicle dispersing a crowd near a food distribution point. Another series documented the aftermath of an airstrike—families mourning amidst the rubble of what had been their home.

Abramov swallowed hard as he flipped to the next section: operational reports from the Federation’s Landmate peacekeeping forces. He read with mounting dread.

> *March 12, 2024: Unit deployment to the Jabalia refugee camp. Aid convoy intercepted by IDF patrol. Federation Landmates intervened, neutralizing harassment without casualties. Civilians secured in designated humanitarian safe zone.*

> *June 3, 2024: Aid workers detained at Beit Hanoun crossing. Federation units deployed to ensure unimpeded passage of medical supplies.*

The reports were clinical, precise, and accompanied by the Federation’s own satellite imagery and drone surveillance. There was no room for denial, no ambiguity to exploit.

Then came the testimonials. Refugee accounts of forced evacuations, of livelihoods destroyed, of the constant fear of displacement. Statements from aid workers detailing the harassment they faced and the gratitude for the Federation’s intervention. One particular account stood out, scrawled in a trembling hand:

> *“They came in like angels, these giants in armor. They didn’t hurt anyone, only told the soldiers to leave us be. We felt safe for the first time in years.”*

### Scene 3: The Final Verdict

Abramov’s hands shook as he reached the final section. A meticulously detailed analysis of every opportunity Israel had missed to normalize relations with its neighbors over the past thirty years. Peace initiatives rejected, overtures rebuffed, and political grandstanding that deepened divides. The weight of history pressed down on him, starkly presented in a series of charts, timelines, and cold, unflinching assessments.

Then, on the last page, a single message in bold, block letters:

**DENIED. FOR NOW. YOU NEED TO DO BETTER.**

Abramov stared at the words, his chest tightening. It wasn’t just a rebuke; it was a warning, a judgment rendered by an entity that operated beyond the constraints of nations and alliances. The Federation had not only denied his government’s request—they had exposed Israel’s darkest flaws in the process.

The dossier snapped shut in his hands. Abramov leaned back in his chair, his mind racing. This wasn’t just a message for him—it was a challenge. A call to action that would not be ignored.

Outside his office, the first stirrings of activity began as his aides and ministers arrived to start the day. But inside, the weight of the Federation’s words loomed heavy over the prime minister, a reminder that they were indeed watching—and waiting for Israel to do better.

## Chapter 2: A Message Delivered (Continued)

### Scene 4: An Emergency Session

The chamber of the Knesset buzzed with an unusual energy. Emergency sessions were rare, called only for matters of utmost importance. Prime Minister David Abramov’s summons had come without explanation, but the urgency of his tone in private conversations with party leaders had ensured every seat in the chamber was filled.

Abramov entered, his face set in a mask of determination. As he approached the podium, the hum of whispered speculation died down. The room fell silent, a heavy anticipation thickening the air.

He adjusted the microphone, taking a moment to survey the assembly. “Ladies and gentlemen of the Knesset,” he began, his voice measured but firm. “Today, I address you not with triumph, nor with mere routine governance, but with a reckoning—a reckoning for us as a nation, and a reckoning for me as your prime minister.”

The room murmured, his opening statement unexpected. Abramov raised a hand, calling for silence. He set the thick dossier down on the podium, its plain cover and the Federation’s emblem unmistakable to those who recognized it.

“This morning, I received this,” Abramov said, tapping the folder. “It is a response from an entity that needs no introduction—the EarthSpace Federation. Many of you may not know the full extent of our government’s efforts to secure access to the technology that enabled the operation we all observed in Iran, commonly known as the Radbas strike.”

The murmurs grew louder. Abramov waited, his gaze steely, before continuing. “Let me be clear: these efforts were made in good faith, to secure what we believed was an asset crucial to Israel’s national security and regional stability. We approached our allies in Washington with discretion and diplomacy, requesting what we deemed a fair partnership.”

He paused, gripping the edges of the podium. “And this”—he opened the dossier to its first page, the Federation’s insignia emblazoned above its message—“is the response we received.”

### Scene 5: A Nation’s Reflection

The prime minister’s voice grew heavier as he recounted the contents of the dossier. He spoke of the Federation’s detailed documentation of the IDF’s actions in the Gaza Strip in 2024, of the Landmate peacekeeping forces, and the harrowing refugee testimonials. Gasps echoed through the chamber as he read one account after another, the brutality of their reality stark against the chamber’s polished surroundings.

“We have prided ourselves on being a beacon of democracy in the region,” Abramov continued, his tone almost mournful. “And yet, this dossier paints a picture of missed opportunities, overreach, and an inability to rise above the conflicts that define us. The Federation did not simply reject our request—they judged us.”

He turned to the final page, his voice steady but laced with gravity. “Their message is simple: *Denied. For now. You need to do better.*”

The room erupted. Some members stood, shouting in outrage, their words lost in the cacophony. Others remained seated, their faces pale as the weight of the words settled over them. Abramov waited, his hands gripping the podium, until the Speaker of the Knesset restored order with a sharp rap of his gavel.

### Scene 6: A Call to Action

Abramov continued, his voice cutting through the lingering unease. “This message is not just a denial; it is a challenge. The Federation has held a mirror to us, and what we see reflected is not what we wish to be.”

He leaned forward, his tone intensifying. “The question before us is not whether we can afford to heed this challenge, but whether we can afford not to. If we are to regain the trust of entities like the Federation—or our neighbors, or even our own people—we must confront the uncomfortable truths this dossier lays bare.”

Abramov’s gaze swept the room. “I am proposing a comprehensive review of our policies in the territories, of our treatment of those under our control, and of our diplomatic posture in the region. We cannot rely on force and fear to define us. If we are to move forward, we must be willing to build bridges—not walls.”

The chamber buzzed again, this time with mixed reactions. Some applauded cautiously, while others exchanged skeptical glances. A few sat in stunned silence, clearly grappling with the implications of Abramov’s words.

He finished with a final, resolute statement: “The Federation has spoken, and now we must decide how we will respond—not with indignation, but with action. The world is watching. *They* are watching. Let us show them we can do better.”

As he stepped away from the podium, the chamber erupted once more, debates sparking across the floor. Abramov returned to his seat, his expression unreadable, as the weight of his decision settled over the room like a storm cloud.
