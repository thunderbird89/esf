## Talon
The *Talon* is the latest addition to the Federation air force. It's a multi-role, *multi-mode* aircraft, capable of operating in air, space, and underwater without reconfiguration (i.e. it can transition between all three within the same mission). The airframe is a variable wing geometry design ("swing-wing") capable of moving from back-swept wings through minimum-sweep all the way to locking the wings into the forward canards for a high-speed delta wing configuration

Its modular framework allows customization to a wide range of potential missions by varying its armaments and various support modules before the mission. The framework is centered around a core engineering system that integrates the air-breathing and plasma engines and the pilot life-support system with the power and computing systems, to be augmented by various modules installed on hardpoints and internal module racks.

One of its most spectacular capabilities is the *sub-orbital boost*, where the pilot can select a pre-programmed destination, and the fighter will automatically pitch up, accelerate to just shy of escape velocity, execute the gravity turn, and put itself on a re-entry course towards the selected destination. This is intended as an escape manoeuvre (by out-climbing and outrunning any pursuers), and the acceleration almost invariably results in the pilot's blackout while the craft flies itself to the destination.

## Aeon
The Aeon _Extreme Deep Invader_ is a strange-looking lifting-body aircraft whose very few surfaces - only five flat planes forming a deltoid-based pyramid, inspired by taking the F-117's airframe to a logical extreme - deflect radar waves away. 
The craft is equipped with a MASER emitter in the nose, a rapid-fire gatling coilgun at the front housed inside the fuselage, and can open its sides to expose a rack of four missiles on each side. It can also open only it's aft surfaces to expose its pair of plasma engines and achieve much greater speeds at the expense of breaking its stealth. It's intended to execute precision strikes deep in enemy territory using its MASER weapon, but can defend itself in a dogfight to a degree using its other weapons.

#### Overview
The *Aeon Extreme Deep Invader* is the EarthSpace Federation’s latest in a line of cutting-edge stealth strike aircraft, designed to perform precision deep-penetration missions within hostile territory. Utilizing a revolutionary five-plane deltoid-based pyramid shape, the *Aeon* is nearly undetectable by modern radar systems and operates as both a surgical strike platform and a highly adaptable self-defense unit.

**Role**:  
- Precision strikes deep in enemy territory.
- Engagement in air-to-air combat as a secondary capability.
- High-speed evasion and extraction using plasma engines when stealth is compromised.

**Primary Target**:  
High-value infrastructure, communications hubs, command-and-control centers, anti-aircraft installations, and enemy spacecraft.

---

#### Design and Structure
The *Aeon*’s unique design diverges from traditional aircraft forms. Its lifting-body structure features five sharply angled flat planes forming a deltoid-based pyramid. This geometric layout is optimized for extreme stealth, effectively deflecting radar waves away from the source and minimizing its signature. Unlike conventional stealth aircraft, the *Aeon* has no visible ailerons or stabilizers, relying on vectored thrust and adaptive control surfaces for maneuverability.

- **Material Composition**: The *Aeon* is constructed using a classified blend of metamaterials and advanced composites, offering an extremely low radar cross-section (RCS). Its surface absorbs and diffuses radio waves, rendering it almost invisible to contemporary radar systems.
  
- **Lifting Body**: The *Aeon*’s entire airframe functions as a lifting body, maximizing lift with minimal drag. This allows for sustained flight at extremely high altitudes and long ranges without conventional wings.

#### Armaments and Capabilities
1. **Nose-Mounted Maser Emitter**:  
   - **Type**: Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (MASER)  
   - **Primary Function**: The MASER is the *Aeon*'s primary weapon, designed for precision strikes against ground targets and aerial threats. It is capable of disabling enemy electronics, radars, and communication systems at long range, effectively neutralizing air defenses and ground installations. When focused, it can also cause structural damage to lightly armored targets.
   - **Range**: Effective at ranges of up to 500 kilometers. Can be modulated for precision targeting over short distances or broad-area disruption.
   - **Energy Source**: Fed directly by the aircraft’s micro-fusion plant, providing sustained bursts or continuous beams of energy for up to 20 minutes at maximum output.

2. **Gatling Coilgun (Front Fuselage)**:  
   - **Type**: Magnetically-Accelerated Projectile Weapon (Gatling Coilgun)  
   - **Caliber**: 25mm tungsten rounds  
   - **Function**: The Gatling coilgun provides rapid-fire capability in both air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements. It can deliver a sustained barrage of hypervelocity projectiles, making it suitable for use in close-range dogfights or strafing runs.
   - **Rate of Fire**: Up to 5,000 rounds per minute  
   - **Magazine Capacity**: 500 rounds, with reload capability during rearming operations on Federation carriers or forward bases.

3. **Missile Racks (Side Compartments)**:  
   - **Loadout**: 4 missiles per side, housed in internal racks to maintain stealth.
   - **Missile Types**:  
     - **Anti-Aircraft Missiles**: Advanced seekers capable of engaging enemy aircraft with extreme precision. Equipped with electromagnetic pulse (EMP) warheads to disable electronic systems.
     - **Surface-to-Surface Missiles**: Precision-guided munitions designed for deep penetration into hardened structures or enemy bunkers.
   - **Stealth Consideration**: The missile racks are concealed within the body of the aircraft. Only when deploying the missiles do the side panels open, momentarily exposing the craft to radar. 

4. **Plasma Engines (Aft Compartments)**:  
   - **Type**: Micro-Fusion Powered Plasma Turbines  
   - **Function**: The plasma engines allow the *Aeon* to achieve speeds far exceeding any modern jet aircraft. When the rear panels open to expose the engines, the *Aeon* can accelerate into hypersonic speeds for rapid egress or interception. This speed comes at the cost of breaking its radar invisibility, as the plasma exhaust and heat signature become detectable.
   - **Speed**: Capable of Mach 8+ in open flight.
   - **Stealth Limitation**: Once the plasma engines are activated, the *Aeon*’s stealth is compromised. This function is intended for emergency situations requiring rapid escape or high-speed interception.

---

#### Operational Capabilities
- **Stealth Infiltration**: The *Aeon* is designed to infiltrate heavily defended airspace without detection. Its passive stealth systems can bypass radar grids and active scanning technologies with ease.  
- **Electronic Warfare**: The MASER emitter doubles as an electronic warfare (EW) tool, capable of jamming enemy communications and disabling radar systems, providing the *Aeon* with uncontested air superiority during deep-strike missions.
- **High-Altitude Operations**: The lifting-body design allows for operation at extreme altitudes, providing a vantage point over any surface-based anti-aircraft installations and satellite systems.
  
---

#### Tactical Role
The *Aeon* is typically deployed in high-stakes missions requiring complete operational secrecy. Its role involves infiltrating enemy territory, neutralizing strategic defenses, and delivering precision strikes on critical targets, often without the need for support. 

In emergency combat situations, the *Aeon* can hold its own against enemy aircraft using its advanced coilgun and missile loadout. However, it is optimized for speed and stealth rather than prolonged dogfights, relying on its plasma engines to escape once its presence is detected.

#### Deployment and Strategic Implications
- The *Aeon* is a strategic asset in the EarthSpace Federation’s covert operations, enabling precision strikes that can change the course of conflicts without exposing the Federation’s full technological superiority.
- Its ability to remain undetected makes it a vital tool for dismantling enemy installations, especially in preemptive strikes against hostile nations or extraterrestrial threats.

## Scorpion
The Scorpion is an aerial gunship with limited transport capability, intended to provide close air support to infantry and mechanized infantry, including in built-up settings, providing scouting and heavy cover fire. It was described as a hybrid of the U. S. Apache and the Russian Mil Mi-24 Hind.

The Scorpion has two hybrid air-breathing/plasma engines mounted on short high-mounted wings with swivel joints that allow the engines to rotate and vector thrust independently (somewhat similar to the V-22 Osprey, but also capable of swiveling outwards for better thrust vectoring). The hull has mid-class shield generators and is space-capable. Inside, there's room for 12 infantry units on jump seats accessible via side doors, or 3 Landmates, with another 2 capable of being secured under the wings. Both side doors have gimbaled plasma cannons that infantry can utilize, but the onboard AI can also control to provide cover fire. The Scorpion utilizes the same modular framework all other Federation vehicles and units do, with internal module racks providing an extensible system.

In terms of armaments, the main offensive capability is a chin-mounted turreted rapid-fire plasma cannon with head tracking, along with three hardpoints on each wing and further two on the sides of the hull, capable of mounting missile pods or other equipment. Its battle computer is capable of maintaining target locks on up to 16 targets simultaneously and direct guided missile fire on all, while also streaming target information to local allied units and command posts for tactical/strategic data fusion.

## Aurora
The Aurora high-speed attack drone is made to be invulnerable to anti-air defenses by virtue of its astonishing speed. Four high-performance plasma engines can accelerate the "flying wing" drone to speeds where the compression heating of the air alone creates a plasma sheath around the unit, and its dedicated high-performance AI allows it to avoid any incoming attacks.
Notably, the Aurora is *not* stealthy - considering the plasma sheath created by atmospheric heating renders stealth moot - nor does it feature the modular architecture common to Federation units, being focused solely on overwhelmingly fast and precise strikes. When in flight, the Aurora's path is marked by a faintly luminous trail of cooling plasma, often visible in the night sky.

The Aurora utilizes the _Stiletto fast missile_ as its *only* armament. The Stiletto uses another plasma engine to accelerate rapidly to Mach 15 on launch, covering the distance to its target almost immediately. Its armored tip allows it to penetrate reinforced structures by virtue of its sheer speed and detonate its warhead inside for maximum destruction.

During its missions, the Aurora travels at post-hypersonic speeds to its target area, where it deploys air brakes to momentarily slow down to app. Mach 5. It opens its five missile bays, each with a dedicated high-resolution targeting radar; finds and lights it targets, and fires the five Stiletto missiles. Once the missiles impact and detonate, the Aurora scans the target areas to verify damage or destruction of its targtes before retracting its air brakes and accelerating back to high-speed egress. The actual strikes usually occur in under 30 seconds, from deployment of the air brakes to their retraction.

## VGA-6 Dragon Heavy Attack Gunship
### Overview

The *VAA-6 Dragon* is a heavy gunship aerodyne designed by EarthSpace Federation Aerospace Command in response to sustained combat operations on Xenari client worlds, particularly against Ryzak-backed surface militias. Where the *Scorpion* excels in surgical fire support, the *Dragon* represents the next echelon: brute-force aerial dominance. It is optimized for close air support, battlefield suppression, and combat insertion in high-threat environments. Its structural silhouette, firepower, and survivability place it among the most formidable rotary-winged aerodynes in the Federation’s arsenal.

---

### Airframe and Propulsion

The *Dragon* is built on a large-frame aerodyne chassis, roughly comparable in mass and footprint to the terrestrial A-10 *Warthog*. It features a pair of dual high-mounted wing stubs in staggered tandem layout, each terminating in nacelle-mounted high-thrust plasma turbofans. This configuration enables exceptional low-speed maneuverability and VTOL capability, while preserving the heavy-lift and combat loiter characteristics essential for battlefield persistence.

The redundant nacelle layout allows continued flight on reduced engine load, and each engine pod integrates localized vectoring for tight-turn ground support patterns.

---

### Armament Configuration

The *Dragon*'s firepower is its defining trait. Primary and secondary weapons systems are integrated across multiple hardpoints to allow for full three-dimensional combat envelopes:

#### Fixed and Semi-Fixed Weapons
- **Dorsal Missile Banks**: Two dorsal racks, each with four canted vertical launch cells, provide eight ready-to-fire smart missile tubes. These are loaded with multi-role guided munitions designed for area suppression, point strikes, or programmable airburst saturation.
- **Side-Mounted Plasma Cannons**: Twin rapid-fire plasma cannons mounted on gimbals beside the main side doors provide a direct-fire volume suppression capability. These are rated for light vehicle and hardened position destruction.

#### Turret Hardpoints
- **Ventral Turrets**: Forward and aft underslung hardpoints house automated plasma autocannon turrets. These are primarily used for ground sweeping or area denial during landing and extraction.
- **Wingtip Turrets**: Each wing stub terminates in a powered turret housing—typically mounting high-cycle rail miniguns or micro-plasma blasters. These turrets provide overlapping fire arcs and can operate autonomously or be crew-controlled.

All turret systems are dual-mode: centrally linked to the craft’s AI Fire Control Node (AFCN) for autonomous operation or unlocked for direct human control via onboard gunnery stations.

---

### Crew and Troop Capacity

The *Dragon* is operated by a minimum crew of two:
- **Pilot**
- **Weapons Officer**

However, up to six additional gunners may be embarked for full manual operation of each turret (six total), depending on mission requirements. 

#### Embarked Troop Complement
- **Infantry**: 8 jump-seat mounted infantry troops.
- **Landmates**: 4 drop-bay Landmates, mounted vertically and ejected via reinforced gravity chutes.

This dual-complement allows for rapid hot zone insertion of both conventional troops and mechanized exosuit support simultaneously, with onboard systems capable of managing all egress hatches, AI coordination, and remote recon relay.

---

### Support Systems

- Forward observation
- Spotting concealed positions
- Terminal missile guidance
- Remote artillery coordination

#### Defense and Survivability
- **Heavy Shielding**: Multi-phase energy shields enable sustained low-altitude combat operations even under anti-aircraft fire. 
- **Armor Plating**: Hardened ablative composite plating protects all vital systems; the ventral and nacelle areas are additionally reinforced.
- **Redundant Systems**: Hydraulic, electrical, and control systems are distributed and redundant to prevent loss of function from localized damage.

The *Dragon*’s battlefield survivability rivals that of Federation light dropships.

---

### Deployment Role

Where the *Scorpion* supports limited insertions or urban overwatch, the *Dragon* is intended to dominate the LZ. It thrives in contested battlespaces—those where Xenari client forces may be losing ground to well-dug-in or heavily armed Ryzak-backed militia forces. Its ability to lay down overlapping fire zones, withstand direct hits, and deploy both infantry and mechanized units makes it indispensable for:
- **Hot drop insertions**
- **Evacuations under fire**
- **High-density CAS**
- **Forward operating base suppression**

---

### Summary

The *VAA-6 Dragon* embodies the Federation's escalating response posture in proxy conflicts throughout the galaxy. It fills the critical gap between high-agility skirmishers like the *Scorpion* and full-scale orbital strike assets. Its unmistakable profile bristling with weaponry and flanked by sensor drones is often the last thing an entrenched militia sees before they are obliterated.
