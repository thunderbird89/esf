# Space capabilities
The Federation, through technology provisioned by their extraterrestrial backers, has established extensive presence throughout the Solar System, mostly hidden from humanity's eyes by concealment of planetary bases and thermal masking of deep space assets.

## Space travel
In space, the Federation mainly relies on high-efficiency fusion torches for propulsion. The most powerful of these engines can accelerate their vessels at as much as 15 Gs. At such acceleartions, injected medical supplements are used to temporarily reinforce blood vessels and prevent strokes, but even so, full acceleration cannot be maintained indefinitely without risking the crew's life.

Interplanetary craft are almost always equipped with a warp drive of some size, dependig on the size and purpose of the vehicle. Cargo ships are usually slower, clocking in at â‰ˆ2 AU/s; shuttles and smaller combat vessels occupy a middle ground at 7.5-12AU/s; while interceptors and courier ships move the fastest, at 20 AU/s.

For multi-mode craft such as the Talon, their plasma engines really only permit operations near an established base, such as in planetary orbits. However, space-first variants of such craft are equipped with their own warp drives, allowing the Federation to project power in the system at will.

## Space combat
In combat, the Federation relies mostly on large magnetic accelerators to fire hypervelocity shaped slugs, but also employs kinetic and EMP missiles and torpedos, as well as leveraging lasers for point-defence purposes.

The Federation classes its spaceships similar to terrestrial navies, into the following size classes:
1. Corvettes: mostly patrol and reconnaissance ships, around 20 meters long.
2. Frigates: escort and extended range ships, around 50 meters in length.
3. Destroyers: dedicated anti-frigate and anti-fighter platforms excelling at killing smaller ships, around 100 meters long.
4. Cruisers: larger, multi-role platforms for attack and specialized roles, around 150 meters long.
5. Battlecruisers: sustained combat vessels deployed against similar targets or battleships, being capable of mounting battleship-class weapons via specialized hardpoints, around 250 meters in length.
6. Battleships: frontline combat vessels, 400-500 meters long.
7. Dreadnoughts, Carriers: siege platforms and extended campaign vessels, 600-1200 meters long.
8. Titans, Supercarriers: large mobile bases for extended campaigns and flagships, 2000+ meters long.

The Dreadnoughts, Carriers, Supercarriers, and Titans are not used in the Solar System, due to their conspicuousness, and are only employed when their alien benefactors require their help elsewhere in the universe.

## Dropships
The Federation maintains multiple dropship classes, for transporting personnel, vehicles, and even prefabricated buildings between the surface and planetary orbits.

### Light dropships
Light dropships are smaller, surface-to-low orbit transports capable of transporting one or two platoons of infantry and gear. They can transit relatively quickly between the two theaters, and are equipped with some anti-air capability to deter interceptors.

### Medium dropships
Medium dropships are geared towards carrying vehicles and can house up to four MBTs or the equivalent volume.

### Heavy dropships
Heavy dropships are large "flying cranes" that are capable of depositing or lifting entire prefabricated modular buildings. Each heavy dropship carries a single module or building and lowers it to the ground before launching back into space from mid-air.
